The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving revenue in terms of volumes sold and realised prices. The reconciliation of Adjusted revenue to revenue as shown in the income statement is provided on page 66.\n- 2 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies as the case may be, and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n- 3 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) is calculated as gross profit plus depreciation less administrative, selling and exploration expenses.

We behave responsibly and ethically at all times - working with communities and partners, being accountable for our actions and impacts, and sharing the benefits of mining with our stakeholders.\n\nDuring 2023, we again demonstrated our commitment to ESG through a wide range of initiatives and developments, including in the four areas outlined below.\n\n## Ethics culture\n\nIn 2023, we carried out a major review of our Code of Ethics and Conduct, ensuring that everything we do reflects our corporate values of Confidence, Responsibility and Respect, Integrity and Loyalty (CRIL). We also implemented an internal survey to identify where we are performing well and, just as important, where we can do better.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information,\n\nsee pages 82-84.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThe regulatory uncertainties that had slowed progress towards our goal of supplying 75% of our electricity from renewable sources were largely resolved in 2023 - and we achieved 53.3%, up from 35.6% in 2022. In addition, we finalised our regional climate modelling and initiated a decarbonisation roadmap assessment that will inform decisions regarding climate-related initiatives.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Community relations\n\nAs well as creating value through employment, procurement, talent development and taxes, during 2023 we continued to invest in education, health and sports, water and capacity building in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information,\n\nsee pages 139-150.\n\n## Water stewardship\n\nMining can consume vast amounts of water, often in regions where water is scarce. In 2023, we established a dedicated corporate water management team charged with supporting the implementation of sustainable water management. We also signed an agreement to rehabilitate and operate a facility that will increase potable water for people in Fresnillo city, as well as the availability of treated wastewater for our operations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are committed to reducing our environmental impact.

Silver production was up from the previous year, primarily due to the ramp-up at Juanicipio, while gold production decreased as our Noche Buena mine approached the end of its life.\n\nWe achieved US$2,869.1 million in Adjusted revenue during the year. This represented an increase of 10.5%, primarily due to the increase in the volume of silver, zinc and lead produced and higher prices for gold and silver. Gross profit decreased by 6.1% year-on-year to US$503.2 million, primarily driven by the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso against the US dollar, cost inflation, the recognition of additional costs from the start-up of the flotation plant at Juanicipio, and the increased use of maintenance services and contractors, which significantly impacted cost of sales. This was offset by the increase in Adjusted revenue. Cash and other liquid funds decreased from US$969.1 million to US$534.6 million as the use of funds, primarily the investment in capital expenditure and dividend payments, in addition to the redemption\n\nof the outstanding US$317.9 million principal amount of 5.500% Notes due in November 2023, was higher than the cash generated by the mines.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on our financial performance see pages 64-75.\n\nWith a history that can be traced back over 500 years, Fresnillo plc is a well-established and solidly-financed business focused on long-term outcomes and sustainable shareholder value. Our strategy is robust and proven, and our dividend policy remains unchanged. We aim to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. Our goal is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\nFor 2023, we declared an interim dividend of 1.40 US cents per share, with a final dividend of 4.20 US cents per share, bringing the total for the year to 5.6 US cents per share.\n\n## A challenging macroenvironment\n\nThe final effects of the pandemic have now largely worked through the system, but global geopolitics continue to create stresses in the supply chain, notably the ongoing tensions between the US and China, which are impacting the timely delivery of equipment and spare parts.\n\nIn addition, we have also been affected by changing government policies, which have extended permitting processes for mining operations and projects.\n\nCost inflation was 3.9% in 2023 and led to across-the-board hikes in the cost of labour, materials and equipment. The price of diesel ran counter to this inflationary trend in the early part of the year but that too increased in later months.\n\nAdjusted revenue\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe effect of inflation was made significantly worse by the unhelpful Mexican peso - US dollar exchange rate caused by a relatively positive economy in Mexico. This was driven by investment attracted by the high rates of interest offered by the central bank and also by investment from foreign companies, seeking to establish a presence in Mexico in order to capitalise on its close geographic proximity to the US.\n\n## Working together, thriving together\n\nThe year underlined the value of the close working relationships we have forged over many years with all our stakeholders. Founded on a spirit of trust and mutual respect, these relationships not only help us navigate our short-term challenges but also to build a sustainable future that will provide long-term benefits for all, in line with our Purpose - to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold.\n\nFor example, we are working together with our suppliers to mitigate the effects of inflation and the strong peso by identifying opportunities to improve supply chain logistics, reduce costs and increase the speed of deliveries of equipment, spare parts and services.\n\nIn terms of our workforce, while the recent labour reforms caused some initial disruption to our activities, they have ultimately helped us build closer relationships with our people and their unions. Through initiatives such as greater automation, we are working closely with them to increase productivity in our mines -- which will enable us to manage the impact of inflation by producing more from the same resources.",

Key among these is safety, and it is with great sadness that we report four fatalities among the contractors' workforce during 2023 and one in early 2024. These incidents are unacceptable and serve only to strengthen our resolve to achieve zero harm. We are intensifying the implementation of our 'I Care, We Care' safety programme, with a heightened focus on improving our management of high-potential risks and critical risks, together with increased engagement with our contractors' workforce. The safety of our people is paramount and will never be compromised.\n\nOur neighbouring communities continue to be the foundation stones that sustain our existing operations and facilitate future projects - and we value and nurture our vital partnerships with them. We earn their trust through meaningful engagement and by being accountable for our actions, working hard to establish close and harmonious relationships that ensure the seamless continuation of our social licence to operate across our project pipeline. We fully understand the concerns that can arise when a new mine is proposed, and are committed to engaging with local people in order to address their concerns and explain how our presence can lead to more sustainable communities - ranging from creating employment opportunities and economic growth to providing comprehensive support for education and healthcare.\n\n## Board activities\n\nThe Board met regularly throughout the year and discussed a range of matters, including the latest mining and regulatory developments in Mexico. For the second year running, in July we held a valuable working meeting of the Board which enabled Directors to discuss wider strategic issues with our executive team. Key topics included: a review of Fresnillo's Purpose, mission, vision, values and business model; megatrends in the global mining industry; production; mine exploration and development; and the Company's ESG (environment, social and governance) and climate strategy.\n\nFresnillo's safety record during the year was a significant cause of concern at Board level. We have stressed the need for our management team to improve safety culture across all our sites, and fully support the HSECR Committee's insistence on the implementation of stricter disciplinary measures.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM in London, it was pleasing to see that all the proposed resolutions were strongly supported by our shareholders, including the re-appointment of Charles Jacobs and B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera as Independent Non-executive Directors, as well as some minor changes to our Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\nIn September, we engaged consultants Lintstock to manage our annual review of the Board and its committees, in compliance with our commitment to seek external support for this review every three years. Lintstock's findings were discussed at our Board meeting in October and we were delighted to note that the key outcome of the review was that the Board and its committees continue to perform very well. Lintstock did, however, make a number of helpful suggestions to improve that performance still further and, following consideration, these will be acted upon during 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor further details of the Board's activities, please see my introduction to the Governance Report on page 188.\n\n<!-- image -->",

At the same time, we will maintain our commitment to investing in exploration activities in Mexico, Peru and Chile, and strive to transform what is an undoubtedly exciting pipeline into operational projects that will help us achieve our ambitions in the years ahead.\n\nFresnillo does not and cannot operate in a vacuum. We depend on our employees, our suppliers, our local communities, our shareholders and the government to actively engage with our objectives and ambitions in order to fulfil our Purpose.

We worked together with our stakeholders to deliver on our production expectations while also making good progress in advancing our pipeline of future projects.\n\nWe achieved a sound operating performance in 2023, despite headwinds which included inflation and an unfavourable Mexican peso - US dollar exchange rate.\n\nThroughout, we remained extremely grateful to our stakeholders, who continued to collaborate closely with our own teams to build a sustainable future for our business, in line with our Purpose. We recognise that Fresnillo thrives when our stakeholder groups thrive, so working together to support our people, suppliers, local communities and the government is not only the right thing to do - it is a commercial imperative. You can discover more about how we have worked with our stakeholders in the case studies throughout this report.\n\nThe year also saw us advance several exciting projects that we expect to make further significant progress in the months and years ahead.\n\n## Production highlights and price review\n\nIn addition to external macroeconomic factors, we experienced minor operational setbacks with a delay to the start-up of operations at the new Pyrites plant at Fresnillo, reduced availability of haulage equipment at San Juli\u00e1n and lower than expected ore grades at Fresnillo that impacted the year's performance.

This was primarily due to lower production at Noche Buena as the mine approached the end of its life.\n\nAttributable by-product lead and zinc production increased 9.2% and 8.6% to 57,833 tonnes and 107,705 tonnes respectively, primarily due to the increased contribution of Juanicipio and higher ore grades and volumes of ore processed at Saucito.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPlease find more details on production at each of our mines on pages 48-63.\n\nDuring 2023, the average realised silver price was US$23.6 and that for gold US$1,957.7, an increase of 8.8% and 8.8% respectively. The average price for zinc decreased by 22.6% while the average lead price remained broadly unchanged at US$0.95 per pound. With central banks around the world raising interest levels to counter inflation, I believe that silver and gold prices established a floor during the year. The fact that prices did not fall below US$20 per ounce and US$1,800 per ounce for silver and gold respectively shows the strength and long-term sustainability of these metals, even through tough economic times.\n\nWhile forecasting global economic conditions is always difficult, I expect that falling interest rates and increased demand for silver in particular - driven by the expansion of green investments and specifically in solar panels, for which silver is a key component - should strengthen prices in 2024. Please see pages 28-29 for more details on prices and how they have been influenced by market dynamics.\n\n## Our strategy in action\n\nOur strategy is the engine that drives Fresnillo plc forward. It comprises four\n\nGold production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstrategic pillars and here I report on how we have performed against each one.\n\n## Maximising the potential of existing operations\n\nEnsuring that our operational mines are performing as efficiently as possible is our primary strategic objective - and this is an area where we rely heavily on the skills and availability of our people. Following the Mexican government's introduction of labour reforms in 2021, we initiated a series of recruitment and training campaigns. These continue to be successful, and all our mines were again fully staffed throughout the year.\n\nAcross the portfolio, we are continuing to address the ongoing impact of inflation and the revaluation of the Mexican peso by investing in initiatives, including the greater use of technology and autonomous drilling. We are also launching schemes to reduce haulage costs, which become more significant when we work more distant seams that require greater haulage. At the Fresnillo mine, for example, the deepened San Carlos shaft is set to reduce distances, speed up haulage and cut costs. This is expected to drive a marked improvement in our ability to efficiently access seams which account for more than half of the mine's reserves.\n\nAt Saucito, our initiatives include efforts to stabilise areas of poor rock quality. New equipment was delivered towards the end of the year, leading to development rates returning to 3,000m per month in December, an achievement that sets us up well for the year ahead.\n\nWe completed the safe ramp-up of our new Juanicipio mine in the third quarter of 2023 and it is now running at nameplate capacity in line with expectations. Juanicipio will have a positive impact on both silver and gold production, helping to offset the lower production at Noche Buena as it nears its end of life, with higher production of both lead and zinc further supporting our overall performance.\n\nWith recovery rates at the new Pyrites plant at Fresnillo initially falling short of anticipated levels, we initiated some technical works and conducted tests to improve performance. We subsequently took the decision to only process historical\n\nSilver production\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ntailings, as recovery rates improved significantly when following this strategy, and we will continue on the same path in 2024. This means that volumes processed will inevitably be lower than originally planned - although recovery rates and profitability will be higher than would be the case if we processed both current and historical tailings.\n\n## Delivering growth through development projects\n\nWith our two most recent development projects - the new mine at Juanicipio and Phase II of the Pyrites plant at Fresnillo - being commissioned and therefore moving into our portfolio of existing operations, we are now focusing on enabling potential new projects to flow from the pipeline and deliver further growth.\n\nWe are continuing to concentrate on identifying M&A targets, not only in Mexico but also in the wider region. Establishing operations in different jurisdictions will enable us to de-risk the business by reducing country risk.\n\nHowever, several of the projects I discuss under the next strategic pillar are close to moving from the pipeline and becoming standalone projects in their own right. Our teams are now working to identify which are most suitable in terms of operational and financial feasibility.\n\nOnce further exploration or metallurgical studies have been completed, the project or projects identified as holding the greatest potential will be presented to the Board for approval, at which point capital expenditure will be granted and construction work can commence.\n\nThis is a very exciting moment for everybody at Fresnillo plc, as we work hard to define the next generation of projects for the development stage.",

We have high hopes that the projects currently under consideration will play their part in boosting production, generating long-term shareholder value, providing employment, supporting communities and delivering tax revenues that will benefit governments.\n\n## Extending the growth pipeline\n\nWe have mining concessions and exploration projects in Mexico, Peru and Chile. These include four advanced exploration projects - Orisyvo, Rodeo, Guanajuato and Tajitos - as well as a number of other long-term prospects.\n\nA low strip ratio, open pit, heap leaching disseminated gold project located in the Herradura Corridor of north-western Sonora state, Tajitos is currently progressing along our pipeline at a faster pace than other projects. We carried out 83,224 metres of core and reverse circulation drilling over 2023 and completed additional metallurgical investigations and geotechnical studies towards the end of the year. The next step is to produce a new preliminary economic study and to consider the possibility of purchasing more land for mine development.\n\nRodeo is following closely behind Tajitos. Rodeo is an open pit, heap leaching gold project in central Durango state, and we progressed several regional studies in 2023, including hydrological, environmental and social base lines, along with an analysis of power supply and infrastructure alternatives. Our exploration teams have worked with the local Ejidos to discuss land access agreements. Once these are concluded, we will commence pre-feasibility to feasibility level exploration, engineering and development programmes.\n\nOrisyvo is a world-class, high-sulphidation epithermal disseminated gold deposit located in the Sierra Madre mountains of Chihuahua state. We updated the project's pre-feasibility study in 2023 and strengthened our engagement with local communities. In addition, detailed geotechnical studies have been completed. While Orisyvo shows excellent production potential, there are challenges we need to address around the resources and capex required to progress the project.\n\nAt Guanajuato, a historic, world-class gold and silver epithermal vein field stretching more than 40 kilometres along the central Mexican state of Guanajuato, we intensified our exploration activities during the year, including the drilling of 83,576 metres which gave good results. We have also completed a preliminary economic study, and identified possibilities for conceptual mining and processing scenarios.\n\nElsewhere, we advanced greenfield drill programmes designed to test expansion targets at the Candame\u00f1a and San Juan projects in Mexico and Capricornio in Chile. In Peru, we strengthened our engagement efforts with the local community and government, enabling the resumption of drilling at the Pilarica project and the initiation of the programme at Santo Domingo.\n\nWith regard to exploration prospects around our existing operations, we have continued to investigate opportunities at Juanicipio, which show good potential, in the wider Fresnillo district and also at San Juli\u00e1n. In total, we completed 933,185 metres of drilling during 2023, a decrease of 2.4% over 2022. Around 92% of this total was devoted to brownfield targets.\n\nSilver in consolidated overall mineral resources remained broadly unchanged vs 2022 at 2.2bn oz as the positive exploration results at the Guanajuato exploration project and San Juli\u00e1n veins were offset by mining activities, and higher costs and increased cut-off grades. Gold in consolidated overall mineral resources decreased 3.1% vs 2022 to 37.9 moz primarily driven by extraction, and higher cost and cut-off grades at Herradura, Saucito and Soledad-Dipolos (no mining), partly mitigated by the positive exploration results and increased mineral resources at Guanajuato and Centauro Profundo exploration projects and the Ci\u00e9nega mine.\n\nSilver in consolidated overall ore reserves decreased 10.0% to 356.6 moz mainly from mining depletion and higher costs and cutoff grades at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB), Juanicipio and Ci\u00e9nega, partly offset by increased ore reserves at Fresnillo. Gold in consolidated overall ore reserves decreased 13.7% to 7.1\n\nmoz mostly as a result of extraction and higher costs and cut-off grades at Herradura and Saucito, and the conclusion of mining at Noche Buena.\n\nFor 2024, the exploration budget will remain broadly in line with that for 2023.\n\n## Advancing and enhancing the sustainability of our operations\n\nThe wellbeing of our workforce is integral to the sustainable mining of silver and gold. It forms an essential component of our Purpose. It is one of the beacons that guide us in everything we do: no amount of silver and gold production, successful exploration or other accomplishments can compensate for any degree of harm befalling our people. Violations to our policies or standards, and behaviours that could endanger our workforce, will not be tolerated.\n\nThe tragic loss of four contractors' workers in 2023, and one in early 2024, was not only unforeseen but also profoundly distressing for everyone at Fresnillo plc. The long-term trend of our health and safety metrics has shown continued improvement over the years, with steady reductions in both the Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR). However, recent events have cast a shadow across our hard-earned reputation, with our TRIFR and LTIFR rising to 12.08 and 7.40 respectively, focusing efforts like never before.\n\nThe occupational health and wellbeing of our people stand as our foremost priorities, and we are committed to strengthening our culture of proactive risk prevention across the organisation. Looking ahead, we have laid plans to intensify our preventive efforts, reinforcing a safety-centric culture that effectively manages high-potential and critical risks. This includes an even sharper focus on visible leadership and further enhancing how we implement lessons learnt. This is a long journey and there are no easy fixes, but we are resolute in our unyielding pursuit of zero harm, ensuring that all our team members return home safely. Anchored by the continuous evolution of our 'I Care, We Care' programme, we are confident that these initiatives will pave the way to safeguarding lives and preventing incidents - and to firmly restoring our safety record on its intended course.\n\nFrom increasing productivity, embracing our safety culture and driving innovation, our workforce plays an important role in the delivery of our strategy. We continue to maintain a close working relationship with both unionised and non-unionised employees to build trust and mutual",

After several years without any labour disputes, we experienced a temporary suspension of activities at Herradura in the second quarter of the year. The illegal stoppage by a very small group of unionised personnel was not approved by the union and did not have a material impact on the operations at Herradura. We will continue to have constructive dialogue with our workforce to better understand their concerns and expectations in these complex regulatory and economic environments.\n\nSince our endorsement of the UN Global Compact in 2009, our commitment to responsible business practices has been a cornerstone of how we operate. Every year we communicate our progress and hold ourselves accountable to the highest standards. Guided by our Purpose, our commitment to sustainability was further demonstrated during 2023 through the strategic alignment with 11 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals across our four ESG pillars: doing business ethically and responsibly; caring for our people; protecting the environment; and partnering with our communities.\n\nOur achievements during 2023 - together with our ongoing plans for future years demonstrate good progress against our ESG commitments.\n\nFor example, during the first half of the year, the Board approved our new Tailings Policy. We have successfully implemented our tailings storage facilities (TSFs) governance framework across our operations, and all mining units are now subject to dam safety inspections. We also commenced the design stage of the TSF at Orisyvo. We developed a facility at Ci\u00e9nega that conforms to the guidelines of the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the International Commission on Large Dams (ICOLD) and the Canadian Dam Association (CDA). Moving forward, we expect to conclude Potential Failure Mode Assessments (PFMA) for each site in 2024, enabling us to assess and preemptively manage major risks, thereby optimising efficiency.\n\nWe continue to champion operational and energy efficiency measures. The multimodal fuel station project that supplies liquid natural gas (LNG) and diesel in our Herradura mine was finally approved by the government during the period, allowing better control and more efficient operation of our dual-motor haulage fleet and the optimisation of the LNG-diesel substitution ratio. We look forward to benefiting from lower costs and a reduced carbon footprint in 2024.\n\nWe also continued to engage with the Mexican government to explore how we could increase the share of renewables in our energy matrix. Following an administrative rearrangement of our current energy portfolio, we sourced over 50% of our energy needs from wind. This is similar to 2019 levels, and is particularly noteworthy considering the increase in our overall electricity consumption since then, due to our expanding operations. By optimising our available renewable sources across our facilities, we are confidently moving back on track to achieving our ambitious goal of 75% renewables by 2030.\n\nRegarding our climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, we have now harmonised our risk framework with the central enterprise risk framework (ERM), enabling us to allocate divisional and sitelevel risks and controls to designated risk owners, with the goal of further refining sitespecific nuances through a standardised methodology. At the same time, we have satisfactorily concluded our regional climate modelling. This has generated industry-valuable insights and enabled us to undertake decarbonisation pathway analyses in two of our most representative facilities. These analyses aim to identify feasible decarbonisation technologies and scenarios, while providing further crucial insights to guide our overall decarbonisation journey.\n\nLast year, I expressed disappointment that we had been omitted from the FTSE4Good Index due to heightened climate change requirements. Our commitment to reclaim our position in this prestigious index remains a top priority for Fresnillo plc - and I am confident that the work underway will pay dividends in the near future, not only enhancing our reputation but, most importantly, fortifying our risk management and operational resilience. As we forge ahead, our institutional practices will continue to exemplify our proactive stance in shaping a more sustainable future for our business, our stakeholders and the planet.\n\nWe fully recognise the importance of close, proactive working relationships with the government in Mexico and its departments, as well as with their equivalents in Peru and Chile where we have exploration projects. Several changes to the laws governing mining were approved in May 2023. While we do not believe these will have any material impact on our current operations or advanced exploration projects, certain aspects of the new legislation are harmful to the industry. Others may require additional clarifications, which have yet to be issued. We continue to engage with the government regarding these and\n\nother matters in order to obtain a positive outcome for all - for the government, for the people of Mexico and for our business.\n\n## Looking ahead\n\nWe expect the global economic landscape to remain challenging, with greater uncertainty driven by geopolitical tensions, faltering economies and destabilising events including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. In Mexico, the forthcoming election may bring a change of government and a new set of priorities. We will continue to work with the government, regardless of its political leanings, to make sure that the mining industry in general and Fresnillo in particular can continue to bring prosperity and jobs to the people of Mexico.\n\nFor our business, 2024 and the following two to three years are about stable production and managing our costs while at the same time developing projects that will form the basis of future growth.\n\nIn addition to redoubling our efforts to protect the health and safety of our people, we will strive to mitigate the impact of inflation and exchange rates on our costs, working with our internal teams as well as suppliers to identify efficiencies across the business which will enable us to achieve more without increasing resources. We are well-positioned from a financial standpoint with strong cash flow and a robust balance sheet in place to ensure that we are able to seize opportunities - whether for M&A or to develop new growth projects - as they arise.\n\nOur pipeline continues to be a major source of optimism. Last year I reported that some potential projects could shortly be making their way into our operational portfolio, and I expect us to make further progress during the year ahead.\n\nWhen times are difficult, collaboration and cooperation become more critical than ever. From the teams in our mines, offices and boardroom to suppliers, local communities, government officials and investors, we have worked together to deliver a sound performance for the year, with the prospect of better times in the long term. I would like to thank everybody associated with Fresnillo for your unwavering support during the year.\n\n## Octavio Alv\u00eddrez\n\nChief Executive Officer",

Our industry will need to step up the supply of these metals in order to meet increased demand driven by the transition to net zero.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nIncreased consumer demand, coupled with supply chain constraints, has led to greater inflation in many economies across the globe. The consequent increase in the cost of labour, equipment and energy directly impacts the mining industry.\n\n## Labour shortages\n\nAttracting and retaining talent continues to pose challenges for the mining industry. The talent shortage is particularly acute for workers with the skills and experience required to support the industry's shift towards greater use of technology, including automation, as outlined in 'Advancements in technology' below.\n\n## Government regulation\n\nGovernment policy has to strike a delicate and difficult balance between encouraging economic prosperity, environmental preservation and social welfare, while also addressing climate change by supporting the development and implementation of sustainability-led initiatives across all aspects of industry and public life.\n\n## Advancements in technology\n\nA key area of focus for the mining industry is to improve planning and increase efficiency through the greater use of technology, including automation. The successful implementation of new technologies will help the industry manage challenges posed by rising costs, particularly of labour.\n\n## Gold and silver prices\n\nDuring 2023, uncertain economic growth, high inflation and rising interest rates led to significant volatility in Gold and silver prices. The continuing geopolitical tensions between Russian and Ukraine, along with a complex and evolving situation in the Middle East favoured safe haven assets. As a result, the price of gold trended upwards throughout the year. While the price of silver also showed strength, it underperformed relative to gold.",

Taking a holistic and stakeholder-oriented approach to decision-making, particularly when it comes to principal decisions that have significant long-term implications and consequences, allows us to build trust and foster a sense of shared purpose, make better decisions that benefit all parties involved and contribute to the overall health and wellbeing of our organisation. We believe that by purposefully engaging our stakeholders, we are able to balance their interests, needs and concerns, thereby promoting the continuity, profitability and sustainability of our Company.\n\nOur Section 172 Statement identifies our stakeholders, explains how we consider them in our principal decision-making processes, and reports on how these are connected to our business model and overall strategy. Rapidly evolving environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors are the subject of increasing interest from society and investors, as well as the focus of international regulatory trends, and this is therefore an important area of focus and prioritisation for the Board of Directors.\n\nOur materiality assessment (page 79) identifies the ESG factors that are significant to our stakeholders and material to our operations. Our 'Building Trust relationship with key stakeholders' section pages 30-36 introduces our stakeholders, explains why they are important and provides details on the engagement strategies we deploy to build and maintain strong relationships. Our 'Managing our risks and opportunities' section (pages 151-183) evaluates the risks associated with these relationships and the strategies we use to mitigate them.\n\n## Our stakeholders\n\nWe have identified our relevant stakeholders by considering their influence on the success of our business model and strategy, including:\n\n- \u00b7 how they are relevant to our business model and strategy;\n- \u00b7 their interests, needs and concerns;\n- \u00b7 how engagement is conducted;\n- \u00b7 how management and governance activities are implemented;\n- \u00b7 the actions and outcomes from engagement;\n- \u00b7 the metrics used to monitor relationships; and\n- \u00b7 what risks could affect our relationships with them.\n\n## Our principal decisions\n\nWe consider 'principal decisions' to be those decisions linked with our strategy, or resulting from major regulatory changes, that have significant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future. We have developed a pro forma template that identifies the relevant stakeholder considerations for inclusion in the papers which accompany Board discussions whenever principal decisions are considered.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDuring 2023, several of the Board's principal decisions had relevant implications for our stakeholders and the Company's future, including:\n\n- i. The approval of the Company's 2024 Business Plan and Budget.\n- ii. The approval of the Tailings Policy and Commitments for Responsible Tailings Management.\n\nOn pages 38-39, we provide the following information on our principal decisions:\n\n- \u00b7 Context of the decisions.\n- \u00b7 Decision-making process.\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder considerations.\n- \u00b7 Impact on communities and the environment.\n- \u00b7 Strategic actions supported by the Board.\n- \u00b7 Impact of these actions in the long term.\n- \u00b7 Outcomes of the decisions.\n\nThe Company, its Board of Directors and management are fully committed to effectively engaging with all key stakeholders.

        "page_content": "## WORKFORCE ENGAGEMENT\n\nOur workforce is the foundation of our business success, and their dedicated contribution is instrumental in building a more sustainable future, both for our business and the planet. The Board strives to create a workplace culture where everyone feels valued, supported and inspired to contribute their best, encouraging creativity, innovation and collaboration through open communication, empathy and a shared commitment to wellbeing.\n\nThe Board and its Committees receive information related to the workforce through a range of channels, including direct engagement, as shown in the diagram opposite. This Board-level engagement process enables the Board to understand the views of the workforce on their experiences of working for the Company as well as providing an additional mechanism to raise concerns. For this purpose, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Non-executive Director to represent the workforce in the boardroom.\n\nIn response to the Covid-19 restrictions in 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company adapted its approach to workforce engagement by conducting virtual online sessions. However, with the declaration of the end of the global health emergency by the World Health Organisation in 2023, the Company made a strategic shift towards in-person sessions. This decision was driven by the intention to capitalise on lessons learnt from previous exercises, to strengthen communication foster more personal connections and cultivate a heightened sense of trust within the workforce. However, the option remains for\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez and top management to consider holding certain sessions in a mixed virtual and physical format in the future.\n\nDuring 2023, Mr Fern\u00e1ndez led two inperson sessions in Fresnillo city to gain first-hand knowledge of the views of our workforce. These sessions brought together representatives from the Company's operations in the Fresnillo district (Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio), including unionised and non-unionised personnel, with the appropriate balance of demography and responsibilities. The sessions' agendas reflected relevant workforce-related issues to encourage a candid discussion regarding 'safety and wellbeing' from a holistic perspective.\n\nThe areas of most concern expressed by workers were: (i) insecurity surrounding our operations, which also increases stress levels and affects personal harmony; (ii) fair compensation in the context of the increasing cost of living and travel for non-locals; (iii) safety-related incidents; and (iv) scepticism of the whistleblowing mechanism. Other areas of concern included the need for more training and professional growth opportunities, high turnover, burnout and a call for an improved work-life balance. On a positive note, the workforce expressed warm appreciation for the Company's early engagement with young professionals through a variety of programmes, appropriate technical training, increased diversity, equity and inclusion, and a solid safety strategy. Overall, the workforce believes that the Company provides great job opportunities that have enabled our people to build successful careers.\n\nMr Fern\u00e1ndez's effective communication of specific workforce concerns during 2023 Board meetings has been immensely valuable in shaping the Board's ongoing and subsequent discussions and influencing our decision-making processes. His input has raised the standard for how we define and refine Board-level\n\nengagement, and has played a major part in informing our management programmes and practices.\n\nBuilding on the insights gained through our workforce engagement efforts, we have implemented comprehensive, multifaceted initiatives to address longstanding concerns in three key areas:\n\n- \u00b7 Strengthening industrial safety: we are working to enhance accountability, operational discipline, rigorous verification of critical controls, near-miss reporting and visible leadership, while also promoting the 'workers right to say no to unsafe conditions' campaign.\n- \u00b7 Understanding health holistically: our objective is to encourage healthy habits and disease prevention through permanent campaigns; we also implement initiatives that address emotional aspects, supporting our psychosocial risk factors prevention strategy.\n- \u00b7 Improving whistleblowing awareness: we aim to provide certainty and trust in the whistleblowing process, in particular around confidentiality and protection from retaliation.\n\nThis is an iterative process that identifies areas for improvement while creating a positive and productive work environment with employee wellbeing and satisfaction at its core. Through our unwavering commitment to understanding and addressing workforce needs, we foster an engaged workforce committed to shared goals and continued collaboration to create a more successful business together.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Several new drill targets were identified at the Fresnillo district and are under evaluation. Drilling of new targets will be prioritised systematically.\n- \u00b7 Pre-feasibility level studies at the Orisyvo project, including mining and processing scenarios, metallurgical, infrastructure and water/energy supply advanced at a good pace along with community and government engagement programmes.\n- \u00b7 Core and reverse circulation drilling intensified in the main zone at the Tajitos project with good results in infill\n- and step-out holes; ongoing column metallurgical test work delivered good preliminary gold recoveries. Drilling started in the western part of the district.\n- \u00b7 The drilling programme at the three areas of the Guanajuato district delivered good silver and gold results, including the discovery of a significant ore shoot and the extension of both vein and stockwork ore bodies.\n- \u00b7 The exploration programme at Rodeo remained on stand-by while land access negotiations with the local communities progressed. Social, environmental, hydrological and power supply studies advanced, supported by the continuation of the community relations programme in the region.\n- \u00b7 In Chile, drilling and the delineation of additional targets continued with promising results at Capricornio. The ongoing prospecting programme at Pencahue showed several gold-silver targets with good exploration potential.\n- \u00b7 Drilling programmes were completed at Pilarica and Santo Domingo in Peru; several large-volume exploration targets were delineated at the latter. Agreements have been reached with several communities at the Supaypacha-Alto Dorado porphyry cluster. The community engagement programme was strengthened at all our Peruvian projects, including the new Chiclayo prospect.\n\n## Priorities for 2024\n\n- \u00b7 Invest a further US$190 million in exploration during the year.\n- \u00b7 Continue to focus mine exploration on upgrading mineral resources into ore reserves, with special emphasis on the San Juli\u00e1n and Fresnillo districts.\n- \u00b7 Continue the exploration programme at Juanicipio to fully delineate the deeper areas of the Valdeca\u00f1as vein and advance the evaluation of nearby veins; start drilling in new potential areas.\n- \u00b7 Further develop and strengthen our mineral resource modelling and ore reserve engineering capability, with the aim of providing a stronger technical\n\nvalue foundation and reporting proved reserves for all operating assets.\n\n- \u00b7 Advance pre-feasibility to feasibility level studies at Orisyvo, under a continued community and government engagement programme.\n- \u00b7 Complete the full delineation of the Tajitos ore bodies and advance metallurgical, geotechnical and conceptual studies to support an updated preliminary economic assessment for a new open pit heapleaching gold mine. Advance the drilling programme across additional existing targets.\n- \u00b7 Continue drilling at an accelerated pace at two areas of the Guanajuato district and conduct detailed metallurgical investigations. Update the preliminary economic assessment for these areas.\n- \u00b7 Conduct detailed metallurgical investigations at Candame\u00f1a and Lucerito.\n- \u00b7 Continue discussions with the local communities at Rodeo, aiming at implementing an intensive infill, stepout, condemnation and geotechnical drilling programme and conducting detailed metallurgical test work once agreements are reached.\n- \u00b7 Continue drilling several targets at Capricornio in Chile and advance an additional project to the drill-ready stage.\n- \u00b7 Maintain a strong community relations programme at our Peruvian projects. Resume drilling at the Supaypacha porphyry cluster and work towards permitting the drill-testing of targets at Santo Domingo and Pilarica in 2025.\n\nOur firm and unchanging commitment to exploration sets us apart from many of our peers and provides a solid platform for our future success.",

        "page_content": "## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS - EXPLORATION CONTINUED\n\nWhere many major mining companies seek to grow through acquisition, we believe that the most effective and sustainable route to growth is achieved by creating our own pipeline of reserves and resources which demands a long-term commitment to exploration. By continuing to invest in exploration across all precious metals price cycles and regardless of the peaks and troughs of economies, we aim to keep our pipeline well-stocked both to replace reserves mined each year and to create a steady flow of opportunities.\n\nOur exploration teams have a proud and highly-respected reputation in the Mexican mining industry. They have been responsible for our most significant breakthroughs, such as those at San Juli\u00e1n and Saucito, and are ideally qualified to identify and develop new opportunities. One of the most important roles our teams have is engaging with local communities and seeking their participation at an early stage of a project. Not only does this help safeguard our licence to operate, it also gives us the opportunity to meet and consult with local people, thereby ensuring that we are able to tailor any subsequent community support programmes to meet their specific needs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details on community engagement see pages 139-150.\n\nOur focus remains on Latin America, and in particular on maximising the geological potential in and around our current operations. At the same time, we continue to look to locate and consolidate new districts in Mexico, Chile and Peru where we have identified favourable gold-silver potential.\n\nAll our exploration projects are measured against a set of strict criteria to ensure they meet our operational and revenue objectives. For example, we will only proceed with a standalone project if it offers a minimum potential of 150 moz of silver or 2 moz of gold. We also consider a range of additional factors before commencing activities, such as ore grades, metallurgical recoveries, extraction costs, environmental impact, and sustainability and community investment, as well as the available infrastructure. Only those projects that score well against these requirements receive the green light.\n\n## 2023 performance\n\n## Mineral resources and ore reserves\n\nEstimations of our mineral resources and ore reserves are developed by our corporate technical staff in line with industry standards and audited every year by independent expert firms prior to public statement under the JORC Code reporting standards. 2023 underground mineral resources and ore reserve estimates were based on price assumptions of US$1,450/ oz gold and US$20.0/oz silver, with open pit ore reserves and mineral resources estimated at US$1,515 and US$1,650/oz gold respectively.\n\nSilver in consolidated overall mineral resources remained broadly stable at 2,219.7 moz (up 0.7%) as exploration results, mainly at the Guanajuato exploration project and San Juli\u00e1n veins, balanced mining depletion at mine sites, and higher costs and cut-off grades.\n\nGold in consolidated overall mineral resources decreased 3.1% to 37.9 moz as a result of extraction and higher costs and cut-off grades at Herradura, Saucito and Soledad-Dipolos (no mining), partly offset by exploration results and increased mineral resources at the Guanajuato and Centauro Profundo exploration projects and the Ci\u00e9nega mine site.\n\nSilver in consolidated overall ore reserves decreased 10.0% to 356.6 moz mainly from mining depletion and higher costs and cut-off grades at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB), Juanicipio and Ci\u00e9nega, partly offset by increased reserves at Fresnillo.\n\nGold in consolidated overall ore reserves decreased 13.7% to 7.1 moz primarily due to extraction, and higher costs and cut-off grades at Herradura and Saucito, and the Noche Buena mine reaching the end of its life.\n\nIn 2020, we initiated a major technical development effort to upgrade our mineral resource modelling and ore reserve engineering functions, both of which again made significant progress in 2023. With a dedicated team of 27 specialists, geotechnical, ventilation and economical modelling continued to advance, as did the underground and open pit ore reserve engineering and reconciliation processes.\n\nThe corporate technical team will continue to develop all disciplines in 2024, with a special focus on mining reconciliation, as well as further process improvement, integration and documentation.\n\nIn 2023, our drilling programmes decreased by 2.4% compared to 2022, with a total of 933,185 metres drilled. 92% of drilling activities were carried out at, or close to, our existing operations, in line with our continued focus on brownfield exploration which maximises the possibility of good returns. The following section provides details about our exploration pipeline, highlighting the progress made in 2023 as well as outlining our plans for the year ahead. We drilled 78,576 metres in greenfield targets where we are consolidating districts.\n\n## Exploration at our existing mines\n\nExcellent exploration potential exists around our operating mines, where numerous drill targets have been identified using geological, geochemical, geophysical and remote sensing data, which is analysed and interpreted by our expert team. Exploring these targets represents a good opportunity to add value to our current operations by increasing our resource and reserve base. In line with this approach, 92% of the 933,185 metres drilled in 2023 were devoted to brownfield targets, including 642,598 metres drilled by the mine operation teams, and 212,011 metres completed by the exploration and projects divisions.\n\nThe objectives of the drilling campaigns at our mines are threefold: (i) replenish and augment our mineral reserves, converting inferred resources into the indicated category with infill drilling; (ii) increase the total and inferred resources by drilling at extensions of known mineralisation and also by testing new targets; and (iii) continue to ensure the quality of the reserves blocks scheduled to be mined in the short term, with selected additional drilling carried out wherever deemed necessary due to grade variations. We work hard to ensure the long-term sustainability of our business and to drive growth by replenishing depleted reserves and maintaining a robust growth pipeline.\n\n## Fresnillo district\n\nWhile Fresnillo is one of the most important silver districts in the world, our exploration activities show that it remains under-explored. We are addressing this opportunity through an integrated approach based on detailed mapping, geophysics and geochemistry. We are following up three high-priority exploration targets located within the area of influence of the processing facilities, with positive results.",

        "page_content": "Across the district, the mines and exploration teams drilled 416,858 metres during the year. 65% of the drilling by the mine teams was infill drilling, both within reserves and inferred resources, and 35% to vein extensions and other purposes. Good results were obtained from the San Alberto, Santa Elena, San Carlos and San Demetrio veins at the Fresnillo mine. Good results were also obtained at the Saucito mine, where good silver grades and vein continuity were found at the Natalias, Roble and Ramal Oriente structures, along with the Saucito and Desprendido vein in the southern part of the mine.\n\n## Juanicipio - (56% Fresnillo plc, 44% MAG Silver)\n\n22,015 mine + 13,272 exploration metres of core drilling were completed during 2023 over the main NW-trending Valdeca\u00f1as and subsidiary veins, carried out by both the exploration division and the mine teams. The programme was designed to define the vein character at depth, where silver grades are decreasing but lead, zinc and local copper show higher grades over good widths. A significant portion of the programme was devoted to increasing the potential of secondary veins, such as Preanticipada, Ramal 1 and the oblique Venadas and Valentina veins.\n\n## Herradura district\n\nWe drilled a total of 73,036 metres in the Herradura district in 2023, with activities focused in the final Centauro pit to identify additional mineralised sections and to better define reserve blocks, to advance the evaluation of high-grade veins and disseminated ores outside the final pit limits and to finalise the exploration programme around the Noche Buena pit, which was exhausted in 2023.\n\n31,024 metres of drilling was carried out in the Herradura pit, 60% focused on improving the certainty of the reserve grades and distribution, 30% on resource conversion from inferred to indicated and 10% on the search for extensions of known mineralisation. 33,966 metres of drilling focused on defining high-grade veins and related disseminated mineralisation outside the current final pit model which were incorporated into the Centauro Profundo ore bodies. Good results were obtained from the Ocotillo area and in the evaluation of high-grade structures in the San Andres and Yaqui areas.\n\n3,849 metres of drilling peripheral to the Noche Buena pit and 4,196 metres drilled in a nearby prospect area failed to identify additional resources.\n\n## Ci\u00e9nega district\n\n56,635 metres of core drilling were completed at Ci\u00e9nega during 2023, 40% of which was focused on increasing the resource base in targets within trucking distance from the mill. The remainder was evenly distributed between reserve infill and resource conversion. The Stockwork and the Jessica Transversal shallow ore shoots, located within the mine workings, delivered good gold and silver grades, and resources and reserves were incorporated into the current mining plans.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n district\n\nAn intensive drilling programme amounting to 180,435 metres was implemented by the mine and district exploration teams.\n\n124,073 metres were drilled by the mine team, with infill drilling of reserves and resource conversion accounting for 70% of the total; the remainder was focused on exploration for additional disseminated sulphides and extensions to known veins. Positive results were obtained at the Ultima Tierra and Santa Cecilia structures, where a new vein was discovered in the footwall, and good continuity was proven over a NNW trend, respectively.\n\nThe exploration division team drilled 56,362 metres, focused on following-up the vein system in the southern part of the district. Good results were obtained at the Dura del Bajo, Blanca del Alto, Eliza and Andrea veins. Drilling targets were refined at the Ceniza prospect area, slated for drilling in 2024 once environmental and social permits are granted. A district-wide review of geophysical and geochemical information is ongoing, aiming to generate additional exploration targets based on improved, drill-tested geophysical modelling and the incorporation of detailed multi-elemental geochemistry and hyperspectral data built into an integrated understanding of the San Juli\u00e1n mineral system.\n\n## Greenfield exploration\n\n## Greenfield exploration, preliminary economic assessments and feasibility studies\n\nWe look for projects that have shown good potential for supporting our growth ambitions to bring forward into this category. For projects in the relatively early stages we may conduct preliminary economic assessments (PEAs), which comprise an economic analysis of the potential viability of mineral resources.\n\nFor more advanced projects, we undertake extensive de-risking activities to refine models, explore the extent of mineralisation and provide comprehensive support to a project as it moves into and through the development stage - a key moment in the journey towards becoming an operational mine.\n\n## Advanced exploration projects Orisyvo\n\nSeveral pre-feasibility level studies are advancing well, with completion targeted in 1H 2024, to be followed by a final feasibility study in 2025. Studies in progress include mining and processing scenarios for an underground mine development, location of suitable tailings disposal sites, and alternatives for road access and water and energy supply. Environmental and geohydrological studies, additional land acquisition and a thorough risk analysis coupled with a robust social and government engagement plan (including indigenous consultation) also show good progress. Different options for the mineral processing of sulphide ores, including the bio-oxidation and Albion processes, are under review. These options, together with high-efficiency cutting-edge milling technologies, are expected to produce significant reductions in capital expenditures and operating costs, and will be addressed in the feasibility study.\n\n## Rodeo\n\nThe Rodeo deposit contains 1.3 moz of gold in oxidised ores, amenable to low stripratio, open pit mining and gold recovery using heap-leach technologies. Potential for expansion exists in several exploration targets in the district. While we have not yet reached a land access agreement with the two main relevant communities, during 2023 we continued to strengthen a region-wide community relations programme and have already acquired some land from private landowners. Simultaneously, we are advancing prefeasibility level hydrological, infrastructure and environmental studies, and analysing alternatives for water and energy supply.\n\n## Tajitos\n\nTajitos is an open pit, heap-leach, disseminated gold project displaying fully oxidised ore bodies up to 200 metres in depth, containing 1.03 moz of gold, 68% in the indicated category. An intensive core and reverse circulation drilling programme amounting to 83,224 metres was completed in 2023, focused on step-out and infill holes in the main area of resources. Some drilling was also completed in new exploration targets in the western part of the district, showing promising results.",

        "page_content": "## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS - EXPLORATION CONTINUED\n\nColumn test work completed to date has delivered good gold recoveries; a second stage of detailed column metallurgical test work performed on the historic core available is underway, with attractive preliminary gold recoveries; these studies will be supplemented by a third stage to be carried out over large-diameter core from a current dedicated drill programme. The preliminary economic assessment for Tajitos will be updated in 2024, incorporating the evaluation of social, infrastructure, water and energy supply risks. Given its location in Fresnillo-owned land with excellent access and available infrastructure and labour, Tajitos displays good preliminary indications to be fast-tracked into pre-feasibility and feasibility stages.\n\n## Guanajuato\n\nGuanajuato is a historic, world-class gold and silver mineral system, displaying numerous attractive exploration targets that have the potential to increase its large precious-metals endowment. The drilling programme was intensified in 2023, with 83,576 metres of core drilling completed over priority vein zones in the central and southern portions of the district. This programme included 19,805 metres drilled underground from the Peregrina and Veta Madre historical mine workings.\n\nThe application of our upper-level epithermal model over the large hydrothermal alteration zones in the southern part of the district, supported by detailed field mapping and hyperspectral and geochemical studies, continued to deliver good results. The El Roble ore shoot grew to circa 2.7 moz of in-situ gold equivalent with good grades, widths, continuity and preliminary metallurgical gold and silver recoveries. This discovery highlights the exploration potential of this area, largely over Fresnillo claims. A preliminary economic assessment for a potential underground operation is ongoing.\n\nAt Guanajuato Centro significant growth was achieved both in terms of total gold and silver ounces and indicated resources in veins and stockwork zones, the latter being amenable to low-cost underground bulk mining methods. Metallurgical investigations are ongoing over the largest ore zones detected so far. Conceptual mining and processing scenarios are under consideration for the Veta Madre, Peregrina and San Gregorio vein clusters.\n\n## Prospects\n\n## Mexico\n\n5,309 metres of core drilling was completed at Candame\u00f1a in 2023 at a large high-sulphidation epithermal silicic alteration zone, which unfortunately delivered long interceptions of uneconomic grade. Drilling will continue in 2024 over significant exploration targets displaying attractive gold values at surface elsewhere in the district. The focus will be on the search for porphyry-type mineralisation and on detailed metallurgical investigation of sulphide ores from the current resources.\n\nAt San Juan, a sizeable, gold and silverbearing vein system, 5,391 metres of drilling continued to evaluate near surface mineralisation discovered in 2022. Good results of attractive gold and silver grades over tens of metres were obtained. The resource estimation of this new area has been delayed until results are received from metallurgical studies to define the most suitable processing method.\n\nElsewhere in Mexico, initial drilling was carried out in two projects, and the team continues to apply its expertise in the evaluation of our extensive claim portfolio, using state-of-the-art technologies supported by field work to generate new projects with good potential for the discovery of gold and/or silver deposits.\n\n## Peru\n\nIn 2023 drilling resumed at the Pilarica and Santo Domingo projects, following the return of normal social and political conditions to the country. Long intervals of anomalous to marginal gold and silver grades were found; however, both projects still have significant exploration potential for veins as well as large-volume deposits. The process to obtain social and government permits is in progress, with the aim of resuming the drilling programmes in 2025. At the Supaypacha and Alto Dorado gold-copper porphyry cluster, our strengthened community engagement programme allowed us to start negotiations for the resumption of drilling at several targets in 2024. Our regional prospecting team successfully defined several gold (\u00b1 copper) targets on Fresnillo concessions; this portfolio has been prioritised and the most attractive targets will be followed up in 2024 to secure social acceptance for future drilling.\n\n## Chile\n\nAt the Capricornio project, located in the Antofagasta region, a reverse-circulation and core drilling programme amounting to 14,526 metres was carried out. Good results were obtained from several veins of the epithermal field over significant widths, including the discovery of veins below caliche cover. Mineralisation is shallow and oxidised with potential for open pit mining. Good gold recoveries were obtained in preliminary metallurgical testing. The exploration programme will continue in 2024, searching for additional veins and following-up on targets delineated by geochemical and geophysical surveys. In southern Chile, a significant goldbearing vein field is in the target definition stage and will be drilled once claim consolidation and social/government permits are obtained.\n\n## Early-stage exploration\n\nWe routinely carry out activities at all six exploration offices to accumulate regional geological, geophysical, structural and geochemical data and analyse it in a GIS environment. Areas identified with good potential are followed up by gathering remote sensing hydrothermal alteration data commissioned from international high-quality service providers. The information gained is integrated into the database to refine our understanding of the targeted ore deposit systems. Furthermore, our regional prospecting teams in Mexico, Peru and Chile carry out the field work required to validate the exploration targets and eventually incorporate them into our prospect pipeline.",

These works were concluded in 2H 2023 and the TBM's contribution to development rates is expected to resume in 2024.\n\nProductivity, calculated as tonnes of ore milled per person, increased vs 2022 driven by the higher volumes processed following training conducted for unionised personnel, post the labour reform and the normalisation of development rates, which gave access to additional stopes.\n\nProgress at the San Carlos shaft continued with the installation of key equipment and a number of modifications to improve the design of the service infrastructure. As a result, commissioning of the shaft was delayed from 2Q 2023 to early 2024, thus providing more time to optimise the haulage of ore via ramps while the two sections of the shaft are connected. This project, once fully operational, is expected to support a reduction in haulage costs.\n\n## Pyrites plant at Fresnillo\n\nThe tie in of the Pyrites plant to the national electricity grid was completed in 2Q 2023, with commissioning following\n\n## Financial performance 4\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2023 | 2022   | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                          |  423.1 | 418.5  | 1.1        |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  479.6 | 475.8  | 0.8        |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  264.8 | 225.2  | 17.6       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                     |   95.5 | 88.1   | 8.4        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  156.8 | 197.0  | (20.4)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |   97.8 | 106.6  | (8.3)      |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |   38.1 | 20.8   | 83.2       |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (standalone)       |   97.8 | 91.5   | 6.9        |\n| Pyrites plant (US$)                     |    3.3 | -      | 100.0      |\n| Cost per tonne total (US$)              |  101.1 | 91.5   | 10.5       |\n| Cash cost (US$/oz silver)               |   10.2 | 5.7    | 78.9       |\n| Margin (US$/oz) 5                       |   13.4 | 16.0   | (16.3)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   56.8 | 73.7   |            |\n| All-in sustaining cost (US$)            |   20.4 | 16.3   | 25.6       |\n\nAdjusted revenue, excluding inter-segment sales, remained stable at US$479.6 million, principally due to the higher silver and gold prices offset by the lower volumes of silver sold.\n\nCost per tonne increased 10.5% to US$101.1 in 2023, primarily driven by the adverse effect of the 11.7% revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar and underlying cost inflation. This was mitigated by the higher volume of ore processed, as well as cost reductions due to economies of scale and operating efficiencies.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce increased to US$10.2 (2022: US$5.7) mainly due to the increase in cost per tonne, the lower silver ore grade, an increase in mining rights and the lower zinc by-product credits. Margin per ounce decreased 16.3% to US$13.4 (2022: US$16.0). Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it decreased to 56.8% (2022: 73.7%).\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased by 25.6% to US$20.4, explained by the higher cash cost and an increase in capitalised development, partly mitigated by the lower sustaining capex.\n\nimmediately afterwards. However, recovery rates did not reach anticipated levels. Following some tests and technical work, it was decided to only process the historical tailings as this strategy significantly improved recovery rates. We will continue on this path in 2024, which means that volumes processed will inevitably be lower than originally planned but recovery rates and profitability will be higher than when processing both current and historical tailings. As a result, output from the Pyrites plant at Fresnillo, together with the production from the Pyrites plant at Saucito, is expected to average circa 2 moz silver per year.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver reserves increased 7.9% as additional mineral resources converted to ore reserves and offset depletion. Silver in overall mineral resources decreased 5.1% due to extraction, increased costs and a higher cut-off grade and lower grade exploration results.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nTotal capital expenditure in 2023 was US$97.8 million, which included sustaining capex, mine development, the deepening of the San Carlos shaft and the tailings management programme.\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nFor 2024, the silver ore grade is expected to be in the range of 180-200 g/t, with the gold ore grade around 0.60-0.70 g/t.\n\nWe will review our short- and mid-term planning processes to achieve a better balance between the western and eastern areas of the mine, and optimise volumes and ore grades.\n\nThe majority of our investment in the year ahead will focus on mine development and sustaining capex, as well as the tailings management programme.\n\n## Fresnillo\n\n(US$/tonne milled)\n\n101.1\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n69.9\n\n62.7\n\n## Fresnillo ore milled per person\n\n(Tonnes)\n\n633\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n## Fresnillo cash cost\n\n(Silver US$/ounce)\n\n10.2\n\n% figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n633\n\n608\n\n589\n\n655\n\n712\n\n91.5\n\n84.7\n\n101.1",

        "page_content": "## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production increased slightly to 12.1 moz in 2023 due to the higher volume of ore processed as productivity increased and equipment availability improved throughout the year. This was partly offset by the lower ore grade due to the increased dilution in narrower veins.\n\nAnnual gold production decreased 1.0% due to the lower ore grade.\n\nMine development rates increased yearon-year to an average of 2,920 metres per month in 2023 (2022: 2,550 metres per month), primarily due to the increased availability of mine equipment and improved workforce productivity. An assessment to define the optimal level of development was carried out, and concluded that current development rates of 3,000 metres per month are sufficient to sustain production levels going forward.\n\nProductivity increased vs 2022 as personnel hired and trained post the labour reform became more experienced.\n\nIn 2023, we focused on cost reduction initiatives such as decreasing contractor, maintenance and pumping costs, optimising the haulage process and reassessing our ground control methods depending on the rock quality of the area.\n\nThe Pyrites plant at Saucito produced 861 koz of silver and 2.0 koz of gold during the year. This was higher year-on-year due to the contribution of the Pyrites plant at Fresnillo, partly offset by the decrease in volume of iron concentrates processed from Saucito.\n\nThe project to deepen the Jarillas shaft from 630 metres to 1,000 metres continued to advance, with further progress made in horizontal development and supporting infrastructure. However, a tight labour market and changes to detailed engineering have delayed this project, which is now expected to be completed by 2027.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves decreased 4.3% due to depletion and higher costs and cut-offs. This was partly balanced by the conversion of additional mineral resources to ore reserves in the period.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                    |   2023 |   2022 | % change   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                          |  487.3 |  442.7 | 10.1       |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)                 |  527.8 |  485.9 | 8.6        |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)        |  305.5 |  247.6 | 23.4       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                     |  104.4 |   95   | 9.9        |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                   |  186   |  197.8 | (6.0)      |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)              |  125.1 |  118   | 6.0        |\n| Exploration (US$m)                      |   31.2 |   30.2 | 3.3        |\n| Cost per tonne (US$) (standalone)       |  122   |  113.3 | 7.7        |\n| Pyrites plant (US$)                     |   19.2 |    6.2 | 209.7      |\n| Cost per tonne total (US$)              |  141.2 |  119.5 | 18.2       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz silver)                 |    8.7 |    4.5 | 93.3       |\n| Margin ($/oz)                           |   14.9 |   17.2 | (13.4)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of silver price) |   63.1 |   79.3 |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)            |   21.6 |   16.8 | 28.8       |\n\nAdjusted revenue at Saucito increased 8.6% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the higher silver and gold prices and, to a lesser extent, the increased volumes of lead and zinc sold.\n\nCost per tonne increased 18.2% to US$141.2, mainly driven by the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar, cost of raw material, underlying cost inflation and the increased consumption of reagents at the Pyrites plant. This was partly mitigated by the increased volume of ore processed.\n\nCash cost per silver ounce increased to US$8.7 per ounce (2022: US$4.5 per silver ounce) mainly as a result of a higher cost per tonne, increased mining rights, and lower zinc by-product credits per silver ounce. Margin per ounce decreased 13.4% to US$14.9 in 2023 (2022: US$17.2). Expressed as a percentage of the silver price, it decreased from 79.3% to 63.1%.\n\nAll-in sustaining cost increased 28.8% to US$21.6 per ounce due to the increase in cash cost and higher sustaining capex per ounce, partly offset by a decrease in capitalised mine development cost per ounce.\n\n621\n\n558\n\nSimilarly, silver in overall mineral resources decreased by 10.4% as a result of increased costs, a higher cut-off grade and extraction.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure in 2023 totalled US$125.1 million, mainly allocated to sustaining capex, in-mine development, the tailings dam and the project to deepen the Jarillas shaft.\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nWe expect volume of ore processed to continue increasing to circa 7,000 tpd in 2024 as we increase equipment availability.\n\nThe silver ore grade is expected to be in the range of 200-220 g/t, while the gold ore grade is expected to average between 1.1-1.3 g/t.\n\nCapex will primarily be allocated to required mine development, sustaining capex, increasing the capacity of the tailings dam and the deepening of the Jarillas shaft.\n\n## Saucito\n\n(US$/tonne milled)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Saucito ore milled per person\n\n(Tonnes)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n621\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2021\n\n2020\n\n2019\n\n## Saucito cash cost\n\n(Silver US$/ounce)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n% figures represent margin between cash cost and silver price.\n\n721\n\n749\n\n858",

However, costs were negatively impacted by the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar and underlying cost inflation.\n- \u00b7 Exploration continued in the area. However, no additional resources were discovered at San Juli\u00e1n DOB.\n- \u00b7 The recovering of ore panels under paste fill started and progressed as expected.\n\n## 2024 Objectives\n\n- \u00b7 Successfully conclude DOB mining.\n- \u00b7 Continue exploration in the region with the aim of increasing the resource base.\n- \u00b7 Convert inferred resources to reserves at San Juli\u00e1n Veins.\n- \u00b7 Focus on key cost reduction initiatives at Vein operations.\n- \u00b7 Improve our safety performance and continue strengthening our safety-centred culture.\n\nThe San Juli\u00e1n silver-gold mine started operations in 2016. In 2023, it contributed 23.7% to total silver production and generated 14.2% of total Adjusted revenue.\n\nOwnership: 100% Fresnillo plc\n\nIn operation since: 2016 (Veins)/2017 (Disseminated Ore Body)\n\nFacilities: Underground mine, flotation plant and a dynamic leaching plant\n\nWorkforce: 792 employees, 1,256 contractors\n\nLocation: Chihuahua/Durango border\n\nMine life (years): 3.8 Veins (2022: 4.8), 1.1 Disseminated Ore Body (2022: 2.8)\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nSilver production at San Juli\u00e1n Veins increased 19.8% year-on-year, primarily due to the higher ore grade in the San Antonio, Elisa and San Atanasio areas of the mine. Gold production decreased 5.5% due to the lower ore grade and a decrease in volume of ore processed due to the lower availability of trucks to haul ore to the beneficiation plant.\n\nSilver production decreased at San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body year-on-year, mainly due to the expected lower ore grades in the areas on the periphery of the ore body and structural geological features which slowed down the long hole drilling cycles.\n\nProductivity decreased due to the increase in unionised personnel as additional activities that were previously carried out by contractors were internalised, and lower volume of ore throughput driven by the reduced availability of haulage trucks.\n\nAdditional drilling, geotechnical studies and development were carried out to recover ore panels under paste fill. Mining works will continue in 2024, with the aim of extracting the last remaining ore at DOB.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves at San Juli\u00e1n Veins remained stable year-on-year as exploration balanced extraction and higher costs and cut-offs grades, while gold reserves decreased mainly due to the combination of the aforementioned factors and lower gold grades in new areas.\n\nSilver in overall mineral resources at San Juli\u00e1n Veins increased 9.1% due to exploration, while gold in overall mineral resources decreased 3.8% as a result of the lower gold grade.\n\nSilver and gold in ore reserves and mineral resources at San Juli\u00e1n DOB decreased year-on-year driven by mining depletion, changes to pillar design as well as higher costs and cut-off grades.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure in 2023 was US$74.8 million, mainly allocated to mining works and sustaining capex.",

        "page_content": "## REVIEW OF OPERATIONS - MINES IN OPERATION CONTINUED\n\n## SAN JULI\u00c1N CONTINUED\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nFor the year ahead, the silver ore grade at the San Juli\u00e1n Veins is expected to be in the range of 160-180 g/t, with the gold ore grade expected to average 1.0-1.20 g/t.\n\nFor the San Juli\u00e1n Disseminated Ore Body, silver ore grade for 2024 is forecast to be in the range of 80-100 g/t as the mine approaches the end of its life, with the gold ore grade remaining around 0.08 g/t.\n\nOn 10 January 2024, Fresnillo learnt that Mexico's Supreme Court had granted a ruling in a case in which Fresnillo, as an affected third party, expects an impact to the water concessions that supply water to Minera San Juli\u00e1n that were granted by the Mexican State. The Mexican State is identified as the defendant in this case. The Company has not yet been formally notified of this ruling but expects it to take place in the coming weeks, and will thereafter fully assess the ruling itself and its potential implications. This ruling affects Minera San Juli\u00e1n although, based on current information, any impact to the Company's production is expected to be immaterial.\n\nAll in sustaining cost increased 9.6% to US$23.9 per ounce due to the increased cash cost and higher sustaining capex, partly mitigated by lower capitalised mine development per ounce.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n (DOB)\n\nCost per tonne increased 11.6% to US$50.0, mainly driven by the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar and cost inflation.\n\nCash cost increased to US$11.8 per ounce of silver driven by a lower silver ore grade, the increase in cost per tonne and lower zinc by-product credits per silver ounce. Margin per ounce decreased 20.3% to US$11.8 (2022: US$14.8), while margin expressed as a percentage of the silver price decreased from 68.2% in 2022 to 50.0% in 2023.\n\nThe 65.0% increase in all in sustaining cost was mainly driven by the increase in cash cost, increased sustaining capex and a higher capitalised development cost per ounce.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2024 will be allocated to mining works, sustaining capex, and the tailings management programme.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nAdjusted revenue decreased compared to 2022, mainly due to the lower volumes of silver sold from San Juli\u00e1n DOB and of gold from San Juli\u00e1n Veins, partly mitigated by higher gold and silver prices.\n\n## San Juli\u00e1n Veins\n\nCost per tonne increased 19.8% to US$109.0, primarily driven by the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar, the underlying cost inflation and an increase in the use of maintenance services and infrastructure contractors.\n\nCash cost per ounce of silver increased to US$9.6 per ounce, mainly due to the higher cost per tonne and lower gold by-product credits per silver ounce, and increased mining rights, mitigated by a higher silver ore grade. Margin per ounce decreased 4.8% to US$14.0 (2022: US$14.7), while margin expressed as a percentage of the silver price decreased from 67.5% in 2022 to 59.3% in 2023.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nGold and silver production decreased yearon-year due to the decrease in volume of ore processed, in accordance with the mine plan, and a lower silver ore grade.\n\nProductivity increased as the programme to optimise the contractor base and increase the productivity of unionised personnel bore fruit and more than offset the lower volume of ore processed.\n\nSeveral initiatives to decrease personnel rotation were implemented during the year, including adjusting the work schemes to offer more flexibility, reviewing career plans and training programmes, and improving infrastructure and facilities on site to enhance the quality of life of our workers and their families.\n\n% figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA number of cost reduction initiatives were also implemented. These included a comprehensive analysis of areas of opportunity to decrease consumption of certain operating materials, increase the efficiency of the maintenance process, re-evaluate ground support alternatives and optimise extraction from satellite areas. Together with the rationalisation of the contractor base and the increased productivity of the unionised personnel, these initiatives are expected to decrease costs in 2024.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver and gold in ore reserves decreased 30.7% and 27.8% respectively year-onyear as a result of extraction as well as higher costs and cut-offs. Gold in mineral resources increased 4.5% year-on-year due\n\nto exploration results, while silver in mineral resources remained stable as exploration results offset higher costs, cut-off grades and depletion.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure in 2023 totalled US$43.8 million and was allocated primarily to mine development, sustaining capex and safety and environment, including the construction of the tailings dam.\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nIn 2024, the average gold ore grade is expected to be between 1.1-1.3 g/t, with the silver ore grade expected to average 160-180 g/t.\n\nBudgeted capex for 2024 will continue to be primarily focused on mining works and sustaining capex.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2023    | 2022    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                        | 162.0   | 169.5   | (4.4)      |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 169.3   | 180.3   | (6.1)      |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 144.6   | 129.6   | 11.6       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                   | 48.7    | 50.9    | (4.3)      |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 18.9    | 39.6    | (52.3)     |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 43.8    | 47.0    | (6.8)      |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 7.8     | 9.6     | (18.8)     |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 135.8   | 116.3   | 16.8       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 1,597.8 | 518.5   | 208.2      |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 359.9   | 1,280.8 | (71.9)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 18.4    | 71.2    |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 3,178.5 | 2,011.1 | 58.0       |\n\nAdjusted revenue decreased 4.4% vs 2022, mainly due to lower volumes of gold, silver, lead and zinc sold, and lower zinc prices. Ci\u00e9nega is the Group's most polymetallic mine, a fact demonstrated by the 61.3% contribution from silver, lead and zinc in 2023 (2022: 64.8%).\n\nCost per tonne increased 16.8% to US$135.8, driven by the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar, underlying cost inflation and a lower volume of ore processed, an increase in development and a greater use of infrastructure contractors.\n\nThe increase in cash cost per gold ounce from US$518.5 in 2022 to US$1,597.8 in 2023 was primarily due to a higher cost per tonne, increased mining rights and a decrease in zinc and lead byproduct credits per gold ounce. Margin per ounce decreased 71.9% to US$359.9 in 2023 (2022: US$1,280.8). Expressed as a percentage of the gold price, the margin decreased to 18.4% (2022: 71.2%).\n\nThe US$1,167.4 per ounce increase in all-in sustaining cost was primarily driven by the higher cash cost and, to a lesser extent, an increase in mine development per ounce, partly offset by the lower sustaining capex.",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n## Key developments in the year\n\nAnnual gold production increased year-onyear as a result of the higher ore grade in the sulphides and positive variations with the geological model. These factors were partly offset by the decreased volume of ore processed at the dynamic leaching plant (I and II) as a result of the electrical failure in 3Q 2023.\n\nWaste material hauled decreased 17.3%, in accordance with the mine plan. However, the portion of waste material hauled charged to costs, rather than capitalised, increased in 2023 compared to 2022. This was due to the lower stripping ratio for the main component of the mine during the year compared to the prevailing stripping ratio for the life of the mine (LOM) of this component. This impacted costs because all the stripping was registered as cost in the income statement. In 2022, the stripping ratio was above the average LOM stripping ratio as mineral benches that\n\n% figures represent margin between cash cost and gold price.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwould be accessed in the future were prepared, leading to a greater portion of the stripping costs being capitalised.\n\nProductivity decreased vs 2022 as personnel hauled material over greater distances, combined with the impact of the temporary suspension of operations following an illegal stoppage by a very small group of unionised employees in the first half of the year.\n\nThe Carbon in Column project to increase gold recovery from the old leaching pads was commissioned in 2Q 2023. Ramp-up started in 2H 2023 with a few adjustments being required during the period.\n\nThe pit slope optimisation programme continued, and recommendations are being tested in different geotechnical domains of the pit. Once this is concluded, the mine design will be reviewed and adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nGold in ore reserves and mineral resources decreased 11.3% and 14.1% respectively, due to extraction, higher cost assumptions and cut-off grades and neutral exploration drilling results.\n\n## Capital expenditure\n\nCapital expenditure in 2023 totalled US$56.9 million, which was focused on mining works, sustaining capex and the implementation of the activated carbon process to increase gold recovery.\n\n## 2024 Outlook\n\nGold ore grades in 2024 are expected to be in the range of 0.60-0.70 g/t.\n\nCapex for 2024 will continue to focus primarily on sustaining capex, expansion of the tailings dam and construction of the 15th leaching pad.\n\n## Financial performance\n\n| Financial highlights                  | 2023    | 2022    | % change   |\n|---------------------------------------|---------|---------|------------|\n| Revenue (US$m)                        | 708.2   | 634.0   | 11.7       |\n| Adjusted revenue (US$m)               | 708.7   | 634.9   | 11.6       |\n| Adjusted production costs (US$m)      | 490.9   | 437.4   | 12.2       |\n| Depreciation (US$m)                   | 78.4    | 81.5    | (3.8)      |\n| Segment profit (US$m)                 | 157.2   | 127.9   | 22.9       |\n| Capital expenditure (US$m)            | 56.9    | 105.3   | (46.0)     |\n| Exploration (US$m)                    | 18.3    | 19.2    | (4.7)      |\n| Cost per tonne (US$)                  | 24.2    | 19.7    | 22.8       |\n| Cost per tonne hauled (US$)           | 5.4     | 4.7     | 14.9       |\n| Cash cost ($/oz gold)                 | 1,378.8 | 1,155.5 | 19.3       |\n| Margin ($/oz)                         | 578.9   | 643.8   | (10.1)     |\n| Margin (expressed as % of gold price) | 29.6    | 35.8    |            |\n| All in sustaining cost (US$)          | 1,608.7 | 1,527.4 | 5.3        |\n\nAdjusted revenue increased year-on-year due to the higher gold price.\n\nCost per tonne of ore hauled increased 22.8%, primarily as a result of the longer haulage distances and increase in maintenance, the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar, and underlying cost inflation.\n\nCash cost per gold ounce increased to US$1,378.8 per ounce of gold, mainly due to the higher cost per tonne.

However, mineralised material from development and production stopes continued to be processed primarily at the nearby Saucito plant and, to a lesser extent, at Fresnillo in the first half of the year, while the commissioning and ramp-up were implemented. In total, production of silver, gold, lead and zinc materially increased year-on-year.\n\nSilver and gold ore grades varied throughout the year with higher ore grade areas mined in 2Q 2023 and 3Q 2023 but trending down in the last months of the year as per mining sequence.\n\nMine development continued and reached an average of 1,239 metres per month in 2023.\n\n## Reserves and resources\n\nSilver in ore reserves and mineral resources and gold in reserves decreased yearon-year reflecting extraction, increased costs and higher cut-offs.

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Fresnillo plc are prepared in accordance with UKadopted international accounting standards. This financial review intends to explain the main factors affecting performance as well as provide a detailed analysis of the financial results in order to enhance the understanding of the Group's financial statements. All comparisons refer to 2023 figures compared to 2022, unless otherwise noted. The financial information and year-on-year variations are presented in US dollars, except where otherwise indicated. The full financial statements and their accompanying notes can be found on pages 262-313.\n\nThe following report presents how we have managed our financial resources.\n\n## Commentary on financial performance\n\nThe Group's financial performance in 2023 reflects the operational challenges faced at the mines, coupled with the adverse effects of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar and inflationary pressures across the cost base.\n\nAdjusted revenue 1 increased 10.5% vs 2022 to US$2,869.1 million. This was primarily due to the higher volumes of silver sold, and to a lesser extent, the increase in volumes of lead and zinc sold, combined with the higher gold and silver prices. Revenue increased 11.2% year-on-year to US$2,705.1 million due to the increase in Adjusted revenue, partly offset by higher treatment and refining charges.\n\nAdjusted production costs 2 increased 12.3% vs 2022. This was primarily driven by the adverse impact caused by the revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate which, on average, appreciated 11.7%, a 3.9% in cost inflation, the additional costs from the startup of the flotation plant and ramp-up of the mine at Juanicipio and the start-up of the Pyrites plant at Fresnillo, together with longer haulage distances, maintenance and contractors at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB and Veins), Ci\u00e9nega and Herradura.\n\nAs a result, gross profit and EBITDA 3 decreased to US$503.2 million and US$655.7 million, a 6.1% and 12.7% decrease vs 2022 respectively.\n\nWe maintained our strong financial position, with US$534.6 million in cash and other liquid funds as of 31 December 2023 notwithstanding paying dividends of US$108.4 million in accordance with our policy, investing US$483.4 million in capex, repaying the US$317.9 million Senior Notes due in November 2023, and spending US$182.4 million on exploration expenses.\n\nIn early 2024, the Group signed a five-year committed revolving line of credit for up to US$350 million. This facility is part of Fresnillo's strategy to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, which are core to the Company's capital structure and investment case.\n\n## Income statement highlights\n\n|                                                                                            | 2023 US$ million   | 2022 US$ million   | Amount change  US$ million   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue 1                                                                         | 2,869.1            | 2,597.2            | 271.9                        | 10.5       |\n| Total revenue                                                                              | 2,705.1            | 2,433.0            | 272.1                        | 11.2       |\n| Cost of sales                                                                              | (2,201.8)          | (1,897.0)          | (304.8)                      | 16.1       |\n| Gross profit                                                                               | 503.2              | 536.0              | (32.8)                       | (6.1)      |\n| Exploration expenses                                                                       | 182.4              | 165.8              | 16.6                         | 10.0       |\n| Operating profit                                                                           | 142.5              | 283.6              | (141.1)                      | (49.8)     |\n| EBITDA 3                                                                                   | 655.7              | 751.1              | (95.4)                       | (12.7)     |\n| Tax income net of special mining rights 4                                                  | (174.3)            | (59.7)             | (114.6)                      | 192.0      |\n| Profit for the period                                                                      | 288.3              | 308.3              | (20.0)                       | (6.5)      |\n| Profit for the period, excluding post-tax Silverstream effects                             | 282.9              | 295.1              | (12.2)                       | (4.1)      |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share (US$/share) 5                                         | 0.317              | 0.369              | (0.052)                      | (14.1)     |\n| Basic and diluted earnings per share, excluding post-tax Silverstream  effects (US$/share) | 0.310              | 0.351              | (0.041)                      | (11.7)     |\n\n- 1 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and metals prices hedging.\n- 2 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs.

        "page_content": "The Group's financial results are largely determined by the performance of our operations. However, other factors beyond of our control, including a number of macroeconomic variables, affect our financial results. These include:\n\n## Metals prices\n\nThe average realised silver price increased 8.8% from US$21.7 per ounce in 2022 to US$23.6 per ounce in 2023, while the average realised gold price rose 8.8% to US$1,957.7 per ounce in 2023. The average realised zinc by-product price decreased 22.6% to US$1.18 per pound, while the lead by-product price decreased 1.4% vs 2022 to US$0.95 per pound.\n\n## MX$/US$ exchange rate\n\nThe Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate at 31 December 2023 was $16.89 per US dollar, compared to the exchange rate at 31 December 2022 of $19.36 per US dollar. The 12.8% spot revaluation had a favourable effect on taxes and mining rights.\n\nThe average spot Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate appreciated by 11.7% from $20.13 per US dollar in 2022 to $17.77 per US dollar in 2023, thus having an adverse effect of US$113.3 million on the Group's costs denominated in Mexican pesos (approximately 45% of total costs) when converted to US dollars.\n\n## Cost inflation\n\nIn 2023, cost inflation was 3.9%. The main components driving our cost inflation are listed below:\n\n## Labour\n\nUnionised workers received on average an 8.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos, while non-unionised employees received on average a 7.5% increase in wages in Mexican pesos; when converted to US dollars this resulted in a weighted average labour inflation of 22.5%.\n\n## Energy\n\n## Electricity\n\nThe weighted average cost of electricity in US dollars increased 4.8% from US$9.26 cents per kW in 2022 to US$9.70 cents per kW in 2023, due to the higher average generating cost of the Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the national utility.\n\n## Diesel\n\nThe weighted average cost of diesel increased 17.0% in US dollars to 106.9 US cents per litre in 2023, compared to 91.4 US cents per litre in 2022. This was primarily due to the increase in global oil prices and the gradual lifting of the Mexican government's fuel tax relief that subsidised the cost of diesel and gasoline in Mexico.\n\n## Operating materials\n\n|                                             | Year-on-year  change in unit  price %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| Lubricants                                  | 27.5                                    |\n| Other reagents                              | 8.7                                     |\n| Steel for drilling                          | 7.4                                     |\n| Tyres                                       | 5.0                                     |\n| Steel balls for milling                     | (3.4)                                   |\n| Explosives                                  | (3.8)                                   |\n| Sodium cyanide                              | (5.9)                                   |\n| Weighted average of all operating materials | 1.0                                     |\n\nThe weighted average unit prices of all operating materials increased by 1.0% over the year as the unit prices of lubricants and reagents continued to increase in US dollar terms reflecting global inflationary pressures and supply disruptions. This was partly offset by the decrease in the unit price of sodium cyanide, explosives and steel balls for drilling. There has been no significant impact on the unit cost of operating materials from the revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar exchange rate as the majority of these items are dollardenominated.\n\n## Contractors\n\nAgreements are signed individually with each contractor company and include specific terms and conditions that cover not only labour, but also operating materials, equipment and maintenance, among others. Contractor costs are mainly denominated in Mexican pesos and are an important component of our total production costs. In 2023, increases per unit (i.e. per metre developed/per tonne hauled) granted to contractors whose agreements were due for review during the period, resulted in a weighted average increase of approximately 14.4% in US dollars, after considering the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nUnit prices of spare parts for maintenance increased by 12.5% on average in US dollar terms.",

The remaining cost inflation components experienced an average inflation of 5.4% in US dollars vs 2022.\n\nThe effects of the above external factors, combined with the Group's internal variables, are further described below through the main line items of the income statement.\n\n## Revenue\n\n## Consolidated revenue\n\n|                                | 2023 US$ million   | 2022 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|--------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted revenue 1             | 2,869.1            | 2,597.2            | 271.9                | 10.5       |\n| Metals prices hedging          | 0.0                | (3.8)              | 3.8                  | 0.0        |\n| Treatment and refining charges | (164.0)            | (160.5)            | (3.5)                | (2.2)      |\n| Total revenue                  | 2,705.1            | 2,433.0            | 272.1                | 11.2       |\n\nAdjusted revenue increased by US$271.9 million primarily driven by the higher volumes of silver sold, and to a lesser extent, of lead and zinc sold and the higher gold and silver prices. Treatment and refining charges increased 2.2% as explained below. As a result, total revenue increased to US$2,705.1 million, an 11.2% increase against 2022.\n\n## Adjusted revenue 1 by metal\n\n|                        | 2023        | 2023            | 2022        | 2022             |                             |                            |                              |          |\n|------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------|------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|----------|\n|                        | US$ million | %  contribution | US$ million | %   contribution | Volume variance US$ million | Price variance US$ million | Total net change US$ million | Change % |\n| Gold                   | 1,186.2     | 41.4            | 1,114.2     | 42.9             | (27.8)                      | 99.8                       | 72.0                         | 6.5      |\n| Silver                 | 1,310.6     | 45.7            | 1,089.2     | 41.9             | 128.1                       | 93.3                       | 221.4                        | 20.3     |\n| Lead                   | 121.5       | 4.2             | 106.6       | 4.1              | 16.4                        | (1.6)                      | 14.8                         | 14.0     |\n| Zinc                   | 250.8       | 8.7             | 287.2       | 11.1             | 32.6                        | (69.1)                     | (36.5)                       | (12.7)   |\n| Total Adjusted revenue | 2,869.1     | 100.0           | 2,597.2     | 100.0            | 149.4                       | 122.4                      | 271.9                        | 10.5     |\n\n- 1 Adjusted revenue is revenue as disclosed in the income statement adjusted to exclude treatment and refining charges and metals prices hedging.\n\nThe increase in volumes of silver sold was primarily due to the ramp-up of production at Juanicipio. The volumes of gold sold decreased, mainly driven by the lower production at Noche Buena as it approached the end of its mine life. The volumes of lead and zinc sold benefitted from the higher contribution from Juanicipio and the higher volume of ore processed and ore grade at Saucito (for further detail, see Review of operations). The total sale volume effect (higher silver, zinc and lead volumes sold partly offset by lower gold volumes sold), resulted in a positive effect on Adjusted revenues of US$149.4 million, representing 54.9% of the total variation. The remaining 45.1% of the increase in Adjusted revenues was primarily explained by the higher silver and gold prices, mitigated by the lower price of zinc.\n\nChanges in the contribution by metal were the result of the relative changes in metals prices and volumes produced. The contribution of silver to total Adjusted revenues increased from 41.9% in 2022 to 45.7% in 2023, while that for gold decreased from 42.9% in 2022 to 41.4% in 2023.\n\n## Adjusted revenue by mine\n\nHerradura continued to be the greatest contributor to Adjusted revenue, representing 24.7% (2022: 24.4%). Saucito's contribution remained relatively unchanged at 18.4%, whilst Juanicipio became the third most important contributor to Adjusted revenue, with its share increasing to 17.2% (2022: 10.0%). Fresnillo's contribution decreased to 16.7% in 2023 (2022: 18.3%), albeit generating a similar level of Adjusted revenue year-on-year. San Juli\u00e1n's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue decreased to 14.1% in 2023 (2022: 16.0%) primarily due to the lower volumes of silver and gold sold. Ci\u00e9nega's contribution to the Group's Adjusted revenue decreased to 5.9% (2022: 6.9%) as a result of the lower volumes of all metals sold, mitigated by the higher gold and silver price. Noche Buena's contribution to Adjusted revenue decreased to 3.0% in 2023 (5.5% in 2022).",

Treatment charges per tonne of zinc concentrate increased in dollar terms by 4.9%, while treatment charge per tonne of lead concentrate and silver refining charges decreased by 10.5% and 41.2% vs 2022, respectively. The higher treatment charges per tonne of zinc and increase in volumes of lead and zinc concentrates shipped from our mines to Met-Mex, combined with the lower treatment charges per tonne of lead and silver refining charges resulted in a 2.2% increase in treatment and refining charges set out in the income statement in absolute terms when compared to 2022.\n\n## Cost of sales\n\n| Concept                                                                            | 2023 US$ million   | 2022 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Adjusted production costs 2                                                        | 1,624.1            | 1,445.8            | 178.3                | 12.3       |\n| Depreciation                                                                       | 497.3              | 500.6              | (3.3)                | (0.7)      |\n| Profit sharing                                                                     | 2.2                | 9.6                | (7.4)                | (77.1)     |\n| Hedging                                                                            | (0.2)              | 0.0                | (0.2)                | (100.0)    |\n| Change in work in progress                                                         | 52.6               | (61.6)             | 114.2                | N/A        |\n| Unproductive costs including inventory reversal and unabsorbed  production costs 3 | 25.9               | 2.6                | 23.3                 | 896.2      |\n| Cost of sales                                                                      | 2,201.8            | 1,897.0            | 304.8                | 16.1       |\n\nCost of sales increased 16.0% to US$2,201.8 million in 2023. The US$304.8 million increase is due to a combination of the following factors:\n\n- \u00b7 An increase in Adjusted production costs (+US$178.3 million; +12.3%). i) the adverse effect of the 11.7% average revaluation of Mexican peso vs the US dollar (US$113.3 million); ii) underlying cost inflation excluding the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs US dollar (US$56.9 million) - these two factors combined resulted in a cost inflation in US dollars of 12.4% 4 , which increased adjusted production cost by US$170.2 million; iii) costs from the start-up of the beneficiation plant and mine ramp-up at Juanicipio (US$43.4 million); iv) others (US$32.9 million); v) longer haulage distances and increase in maintenance and contractors at San Juli\u00e1n (DOB and Veins), Ci\u00e9nega and Herradura (US$29.7 million); and vi) costs from the start-up of the Pyrites plant at Fresnillo (US$8.8 million). These adverse effects were mitigated by a decrease in mining costs as depositing activities stopped at Noche Buena as part of the mine closure process which started in May (-US$81.9 million), and cost reductions due to economies of scale and operating efficiencies at Saucito and Fresnillo (US$24.7 million).\n- \u00b7 The variation in the change in work in progress had an adverse effect of US$114.2 million vs 2022. This resulted mainly from the decrease in inventories of ore at Juanicipio, as the flotation plant was commissioned and it ramped-up to full capacity, and the decrease of gold content on the leaching pads at Noche Buena. In 2022, there was a positive effect in relation to the increase in inventories of ore at Juanicipio and gold content at the leaching pads at Herradura.\n- \u00b7 The variation in unproductive costs, which had an unfavourable effect of (+US$23.3 million). In 2023, US$25.9 million was registered as unproductive costs. These costs related mainly to the temporary stoppage of activities at Herradura and fixed costs incurred at Noche Buena from the conclusion of mining activities.\n\nThese negative effects were slightly mitigated mainly by:\n\n- \u00b7 Profit sharing (-US$7.4 million) mainly due to lower profits.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation (-US$3.3 million). This is mainly due to lower depreciation at Noche Buena - as it approaches the end of its mine life and the majority of the assets have been fully depreciated - and at San Juli\u00e1n due to a lower depletion factor. This was partly offset by the higher depreciation at Juanicipio.\n- 1 Treatment and refining charges include the cost of treatment and refining as well as the margin charged by the refiner.\n- 2 Adjusted production costs are calculated as cost of sales less depreciation, profit sharing, hedging, change in inventories and unproductive costs. The Company considers this a useful additional measure to help understand underlying factors driving production costs in terms of the different stages involved in the mining and plant processes, including efficiencies and inefficiencies, as the case may be, and other factors outside the Company's control such as cost inflation or changes in accounting criteria.\n- 3 Unproductive costs primarily include unabsorbed production costs such as non-productive costs from the temporary suspension of activities at Herradura and non-productive fixed mine costs incurred at Noche Buena from the finalisation of mining activities.\n- 4 Cost inflation would have been 3.9% excluding the effect of the Mexican peso revaluation.",

These negative effects were mitigated by: i) the start up of the beneficiation plant and ramp-up of the Juanicipio mine (US$206.2 million); ii) higher gold and silver prices (US$192.9 million); and iii) the positive effect of the gold inventory uplift at Herradura (US$30.9 million).\n\nOn a per mine basis, Juanicipio became the largest contributor to the Group's consolidated gross profit, reflecting the successful rampup of production at the flotation plant. Herradura dropped to second contributor, decreasing its percentage share from 27.5% to 25.1%. The higher costs at Saucito and Fresnillo significantly affected the gross profit at both mines, which decreased by 18.4% and 41.6% vs 2022, respectively, thus decreasing their contribution to the consolidated gross profit. San Juli\u00e1n's contribution to the Group's gross profit remained broadly unchanged at 11.4% in 2023, despite the 6.6% decrease in gross profit. The decrease in production volumes, together with the cost pressures, significantly affected profitability at Ci\u00e9nega and Noche Buena.\n\n## Contribution by mine to consolidated gross profit, excluding hedging gains and losses\n\n|                                      | 2023        | 2023           | 2022        | 2022           | Change      | Change   |\n|--------------------------------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------------|-------------|----------|\n|                                      | US$ million | % contribution | US$ million | % contribution | US$ million | %        |\n| Juanicipio                           | 202.8       | 41.0           | 132.8       | 24.8           | 70.0        | 52.7     |\n| Herradura                            | 124.2       | 25.1           | 147.1       | 27.5           | (22.9)      | (15.6)   |\n| Saucito                              | 80.4        | 16.2           | 98.5        | 18.4           | (18.1)      | (18.4)   |\n| Fresnillo                            | 61.2        | 12.4           | 104.8       | 19.6           | (43.6)      | (41.6)   |\n| San Juli\u00e1n                           | 56.3        | 11.4           | 60.3        | 11.3           | (4.0)       | (6.6)    |\n| Noche Buena                          | (0.1)       | 0.0            | 3.3         | 0.6            | (3.4)       | (103.0)  |\n| Ci\u00e9nega                              | (29.8)      | (6.0)          | (11.3)      | (2.1)          | (18.5)      | 163.7    |\n| Total for operating mines            | 495.0       | 100            | 535.5       | 100            | (40.5)      | (7.6)    |\n| Metal hedging and other subsidiaries | 8.2         |                | 0.5         |                | 7.7         | >100.0   |\n| Total Fresnillo plc                  | 503.2       |                | 536.0       |                | (32.8)      | (6.1)    |\n\n## Administrative and corporate expenses\n\nAdministrative and corporate expenses increased 36.5% from US$94.1 million in 2022 to US$128.4 million in 2023, mainly due to the adverse effects of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar on administrative expenses denominated in pesos, including personnel salaries, and the increase resulting from the review of the Shared Services Agreement with Pe\u00f1oles in line with the increased services provided.",

The year-on-year increase of US$16.7 million was due to our intensified exploration activities aimed at increasing the resource base, converting resources into reserves and improving the confidence of the grade distribution in reserves, together with the adverse effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso vs the US dollar. An additional US$3.5 million was capitalised, mainly relating to exploration expenses at the Guanajuato project. As a result, risk capital invested in exploration totalled US$185.9 million in 2023, compared to US$167.6 million in 2022 (of which US$1.8 million was capitalised). This represents a year-on-year increase of 11.0%.\n\n## EBITDA\n\n|                                                     | 2023 US$ million   | 2022 US$ million   | Amount US$ million   | Change %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|------------|\n| Profit from continuing operations before income tax | 114.0              | 248.6              | (134.6)              | (54.1)     |\n| - Finance income                                    | (50.6)             | (26.5)             | (24.1)               | 90.9       |\n| + Finance costs                                     | 88.8               | 81.6               | 7.2                  | 8.8        |\n| - Revaluation effects of Silverstream contract      | (7.7)              | (18.8)             | 11.1                 | (59.0)     |\n| - Foreign exchange loss, net                        | (2.0)              | (1.4)              | (0.6)                | 42.9       |\n| - Other operating income                            | (35.3)             | (71.9)             | 36.6                 | (50.9)     |\n| + Other operating expense                           | 51.2               | 38.8               | 12.4                 | 32.0       |\n| + Depreciation                                      | 497.3              | 500.6              | (3.3)                | (0.7)      |\n| EBITDA                                              | 655.7              | 751.1              | (95.4)               | (12.7)     |\n| EBITDA margin                                       | 24.2               | 30.9               | -                    | -          |\n\nEBITDA is a gauge of the Group's financial performance and a key indicator to measure debt capacity. It is calculated as profit for the year from continuing operations before income tax, less finance income, plus finance costs, less foreign exchange gain/(loss), less the net Silverstream effects and other operating income plus other operating expenses and depreciation. In 2023, EBITDA decreased 12.7% to US$655.7 million primarily driven by the lower gross profit and higher administrative and exploration expenses. As a result, EBITDA margin expressed as a percentage of revenue decreased, from 30.9% in 2022 to 24.2% in 2023.\n\n## Other operating income and expense\n\nIn 2023, a net loss of US$15.8 million was recognised in the income statement mainly as a result of the illegal extraction of ore from the leaching pads at Soledad-Dipolos by third parties. This compares unfavourably to the net gain of US$33.1 million recognised in the income statement in 2022 which was mainly a result of the recognition of the Layback Agreement granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo pit onto Fresnillo's mining concession.\n\n## Silverstream effects\n\nThe Silverstream contract is accounted for as a derivative financial instrument carried at fair value. The net Silverstream effect recorded in the 2023 income statement was a gain of US$7.7 million (US$48.4 million amortisation profit and US$40.7 million revaluation loss), which compared negatively to the net gain of US$18.8 million registered in 2022. The negative revaluation was mainly driven by a decrease in the production plan following an update to the Sabinas silver reserves and a lower inflation forecast.",

        "page_content": "## FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED\n\nSince the IPO, cumulative cash of US$809.9 million has been received vs US$350 million initially paid in 2007. The Group expects that further unrealised gains or losses related to the valuation of the Silverstream contract will be taken to the income statement in accordance with silver price cyclicality or changes in the variables considered in valuing this contract. Further information related to the Silverstream contract is provided in the balance sheet section in notes 14 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Net finance costs\n\nNet finance costs of US$38.2 million compared favourably to the US$55.2 million recorded in 2022. The US$17.7 million decrease was primarily due to the positive effect of the increased interest gained in short-term deposits and investments. In addition, the 2023 net finance costs mainly reflected: i) interest paid on the outstanding US$317.9 million from the US$800 million of 5.500% Senior Notes due 2023; and ii) interest paid on the US$850 million principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. Detailed information is provided in note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. A portion of the interest from the Senior Notes is capitalised, hence not included in finance costs. During the year-ended 31 December 2023, the Group capitalised US$2.1 million of borrowing costs (2022: US$8.5 million).\n\n## Foreign exchange\n\nA foreign exchange gain of US$2.0 million was recorded in 2023, which compared favourably to the US$1.4 million gain in 2022.\n\nThe Group also enters into certain exchange rate derivative instruments as part of a programme to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk associated with the purchase of equipment denominated in euro (EUR). As of 31 December 2023, the total EUR outstanding net forward position was EUR5.08 million with maturity dates through September 2024. Volumes that expired during the second half of 2023 were EUR7.07 million with a weighted average strike of 1.1043 US$/EUR, which have generated a marginal result in the period of -US$0.163 million.\n\n## Taxation\n\nTax income for the period was US$205.0 million, which compared favourably to the US$67.4 million tax income in 2022. The effective tax rate, excluding the special mining rights, was -179.8%, compared to the 30% statutory tax rate. The reason for the unusual positive effective tax rate was the significant permanent differences between the tax and the accounting treatment related mainly to: i) the effect of the 12.8% revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate in 2023 versus the 5.9% revaluation in 2022 on the tax value of assets and liabilities (-US$214.5 million); and ii) the inflation rate (Mexican Consumer Price Index), which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$54.8 million).\n\nThe reason for the positive effective tax rate in 2022 was the significant permanent differences between the tax and the accounting treatment related mainly to: i) the effect of the 5.9% revaluation of the Mexican peso/US dollar spot exchange rate in 2022 on the tax value of assets and liabilities (-US$72.9 million); ii) the inflation rate (Mexican Consumer Price Index), which impacted the inflationary uplift of the tax base for assets and liabilities (-US$62.7 million); and iii) the benefit from the lower border zone tax which applied to Herradura and Noche Buena operations (-US$17.5 million).\n\nMining rights in 2023 was US$30.8 million compared to mining rights of US$7.7 million charged in 2022.\n\n## Profit for the period\n\nProfit for the period decreased from US$308.3 million in 2022 to US$288.3 million in 2023, a 6.5% decrease year-on-year as a result of the factors described above.\n\nExcluding the effects of the Silverstream contract, profit for the year decreased from US$295.1 million to US$282.9 million, a 4.1% decrease.\n\nProfit due to non-controlling interests increased from US$36.4 million in 2022 to US$54.4 million in 2023 reflecting the higher profit generated at Juanicipio, where MAG Silver owns 44% of the outstanding shares.\n\nProfit attributable to equity shareholders of the Group decreased from US$271.9 million in 2022 to US$233.9 million in 2023, down 14.0%.",

Working capital decreased US$20.6 million, mainly due to: i) a decrease in ore inventories of US$54.6 million; and ii) a US$10.4 million decrease in prepayments mainly to contractors. This was partly offset by a US$45.6 million increase in trade receivables from related parties.\n\nTaxes and employee profit sharing paid increased 39.7% vs 2022 to US$244.0 million mainly due to an increase in provisional tax payments paid in 2023; and the higher final income tax paid in 2023, net of provisional taxes paid, corresponding to the 2022 tax fiscal year. This was partially offset by a decrease in mining rights payments and lower profit sharing paid.\n\nAs a result of the above factors, net cash from operating activities decreased 15.2% from US$502.2 million in 2022 to US$425.9 million in 2023.\n\nThe Group received other sources of cash, including: i) the proceeds of the Silverstream contract of US$40.2 million; and ii) proceeds from the layback agreement granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's mineral concession of US$22.8 million (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).",

The 2023 payment included the 2022 final dividend of 13.3 cents per share paid in May 2023, totalling US$98.0 million, and the 2023 interim dividend paid in September of US$10.3 million.\n- iii)  Financial expenses and foreign exchange effects of US$6.4 million, a decrease of 76.5% vs 2022. Financial expenses in 2023 and 2022 included: i) interest paid on the US$317.9 million from the US$800 million 5.500% Senior Notes due November 2023; and ii) interest paid on the 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050. In addition, financial expenses in 2022 included the interests paid in relation to the voluntary amendment to the income tax and mining rights' treatment of the stripping costs and the deduction of exploration expenses.\n\nThe sources and uses of funds described above resulted in a decrease in net cash of US$434.5 million (net decrease in cash and other liquid assets), which combined with the US$969.1 million balance at the beginning of the year resulted in cash and other liquid assets of US$534.6 million at the end of December 2023.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nFresnillo plc continued to maintain a solid financial position during the period with cash and other liquid funds 1 of US$534.6 million as of 31 December 2023, despite decreasing 44.8% vs 31 December 2022. Taking into account the cash and other liquid funds of US$534.6 million and the US$839.0 million outstanding Senior Notes, Fresnillo plc's net debt was US$304.4 million as of 31 December 2023. This compares to the net debt of US$198.7 million as of 31 December 2022. Considering these variations, the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 remains strong, with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 0.46x 1 .\n\nInventories decreased 9.3% to US$532.7 million mainly due to the decrease of inventories of gold content, at the leaching pads and to be processed at the dynamic leaching plants at Herradura, as well as the decreased inventories at Juanicipio, partly offset by increased inventories of operating materials and spare parts.\n\nTrade and other receivables increased 19.3% to US$482.4 million as a result of an increase in receivables to Met-Mex and in value added tax receivables.\n\nThe change in the value of the Silverstream derivative from US$511.5 million at the end of 2022 to US$482.3 million as of 31 December 2023 reflects proceeds of US$36.9 million corresponding to 2023 (US$31.8 million in cash and US$5.1 million in accounts receivables) and the Silverstream effect in the income statement of US$7.7 million.\n\nThe net book value of property, plant and equipment remained broadly stable at US$2,860.9 million at 31 December 2023.\n\nThe Group's total equity was US$4,067.2 million as of 31 December 2023, a 3.8% increase vs 31 December 2022. This was mainly explained by the increase in retained earnings, reflecting the 2023 profit.",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n## Dividends\n\nBased on the Group's 2023 performance, the Directors have recommended a final dividend of 4.20 US cents per Ordinary Share, which will be paid on 29 May 2024 to shareholders on the register on 19 April 2024. The dividend will be paid in UK pounds sterling unless shareholders elect to be paid in US dollars. This is in addition to the interim dividend of 1.40 US cents per share amounting to US$10.3 million. This final dividend is lower than the previous year due to the decrease in profits in 2023. It remains in line with the Group's dividend policy to pay out 33-50% of the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company after making certain adjustments to exclude extraordinary non-cash effects in the income statement, which this year in particular included taking out the income tax benefit resulting from the effect of the revaluation of the Mexican peso on the tax value of assets and liabilities, which increases in dollar terms the deduction of future depreciation expenses (in peso terms, which is used for Mexican tax purposes, there is no impact). However, this favourable effect in dollar terms could be reversed in the future if the Mexican peso devalues.\n\nAs disclosed in previous reports, the corporate income tax reform introduced in Mexico in 2014 created a withholding tax obligation of 10% relating to the payment of dividends, including to foreign nationals. The 2023 final dividend will be subject to this withholding obligation.",

        "page_content": "## LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE HEALTH, SAFETY, ENVIRONMENT AND COMMUNITY RELATIONS (HSECR) COMMITTEE\n\nDear Shareholder,\n\nAt Fresnillo, our ethical and responsible business practices extend across our entire value chain. Supported by a robust governance structure, a solid performance and guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we strive to create value for all our stakeholders, with a view to consistently earning and upholding their trust.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee, assists the Board by collaborating with management to meticulously supervise the Company's strategies, ensuring that they effectively address environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations. As Chairman of the HSECR Committee, I share with you the key highlights of the period.\n\nDespite improvement in recent years, the Company's safety record deteriorated across most indicators last year; most notably, a 12.08 Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) and 7.40 Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIFR), vs 10.26 and 5.44 in 2022, respectively. Regrettably, it is with deep sadness that I also report four fatalities at our operations during this period and one in January 2024. Most of the fatalities involved contractors' workers. On behalf of the Board of Directors, we express our heartfelt condolences to their families and loved ones. This is a matter of profound concern as we are dedicated to safeguarding our most invaluable asset the lives and wellbeing of our workforce.\n\nRecognising the gravity of our safety performance, strategic measures, swift action and enhanced accountability are imperative in order to address and rectify the underlying issues. So far, a series of measures that aim to strengthen a proactive, safety-centric culture have been deployed, with an enhanced performanceoriented focus to manage high-potential and critical risks.\n\nWe firmly uphold the principle of safety first - valuing life above business results - and our commitment towards the ultimate goal of achieving zero fatalities remains steadfast. Recognising that behavioural change is a key element of success, the Company is actively dedicating significant time and resources to enhance awareness through the continuous evolution of the 'I Care, We Care' programme. Under the stewardship of our Chairman, leadership standards were designed to strengthen our preventive safety culture. These standards were endorsed by the CEO, COO and Senior Management, and systematically rolledout across all mining units, reaching our entire workforce. During the period, we also organised high-level safety engagements with the personal attendance of our\n\nCompany Chairman, CEO, COO and top management; additionally, we also held a safety week as well as the 11th Safety Symposium.\n\nAs most fatalities involved contractors' staff, we have urged management to engage more effectively with contractors through enhanced communication mechanisms, training, closer supervision and updated mining works contracts aligned to Fresnillo's safety standards. We are also actively implementing corrective measures, including more thorough investigations, enhanced accountability (including increased sanctions for breaches of safety procedures), improved training, strengthened operational discipline and rigorous verification of critical controls, among other initiatives. Additionally, key strategic actions include the systematic involvement and field presence of operational leaders to guide and coach broader teams regarding risk assessments. Dissemination campaigns and workshops are also being deployed to empower any member of the workforce to halt operations under any unsafe conditions that may be detected through the 'Right to say no' policy. Notably, the results obtained in December 2023 were promising, with reductions in the TRIFR and LTIFR of over 40% compared to November, and of 15% and 40% respectively compared to the same period in 2022. These outcomes provide valuable insight into the efficacy of the overall strategy and give us some confidence in its potential to create sustained improvement in our safety performance moving forward. However, we recognise that further efforts are required to achieve our desired results and are committed to making ongoing improvements.\n\nAfter the World Health Organization (WHO) and Mexican government announced the end of the Covid-19 public health emergency in 2023, the Company continued to diligently adhere to the recently updated Health Ministry's protocols, to monitor contagion cases with an 82% decrease in comparison to 2022 - and to enforce comprehensive respiratory disease prevention measures. These included conducting influenza vaccination campaigns for workers and their families and providing reminders for essential practices such as vitamin C intake, amongst others. We made good progress in evolving the Health Department to a more holistic view of comprehensive health, with the 'Living in Balance Programme' promoting healthy habits and emotional wellbeing across the organisation. Furthermore, the establishment of the Occupational Health Transversal Committee and the Wellbeing Committee in 2023, as well as the plan to",

Our Community Relations strategy is built on a dedication to meaningful engagement that is aligned with community priorities, and on key departments within the organisation working together to achieve results. The Community Health Weeks - conducted in close collaboration with the UNAM Foundation, local authorities and civil society organisations - reached almost 200 communities and over 6,000 people across all areas influenced by our operations. Sports and educational programmes were also fully reinstated during the period, including summer camps, tournaments and workshops, all geared towards fostering social cohesion through open dialogue and interactive learning experiences.\n\nThe Company maintained its support to five existing FIRST Robotics teams and introduced a new one in Orysivo, underscoring our commitment to STEM education, teamwork and project management in neighbouring communities. At the Laguna Regional Championship, teams from Fresnillo, Ci\u00e9nega and Guanajuato earned awards, with the Guanajuato team qualifying for the World Championship in Houston. The Company also received the 'Volunteer of the Year' award for the dedication of its outstanding volunteers. Leveraging the success of the robotics team, we have extended its impact through the Fresnillo La Salle Excellence Scholarship Programme for the highest-performing students from each team. Following the inaugural generation's graduation in 2022, we forged new partnerships with the Chihuahua and Le\u00f3n campuses of La Salle university, expanding its reach beyond Northeast and Laguna. The programme welcomed ten new students during the period, with a total of 21 students benefiting from this initiative.\n\nWater scarcity and hydric stress persist as major concerns for both Fresnillo and our neighbouring communities and compelled us to take proactive measures throughout the year. In Penmont, Ci\u00e9nega and San Juli\u00e1n, we conducted comprehensive studies and proof-ofconcept projects aimed at improving local water infrastructure. These initiatives are conducted hand-in-hand with local communities and NGOs, emphasising the\n\nimportance of securing endorsement and financial support from local authorities for their execution. In addition, we recently signed a collaboration agreement with the Potable Water, Sewage and Sanitation System of the Municipality of Fresnillo. Under this agreement, the Company will undertake the rehabilitation and operation of a water potabilisation plant and provide the resulting clean water to the municipality. This project serves a dual purpose: mitigating the region's water scarcity issues by reducing our freshwater consumption while also potentially increasing the availability of municipal wastewater for mining operations. By prioritising the delivery of clean water to the municipality, we have underlined our dedication to environmental protection and acknowledged the intrinsic value of ensuring access to a sustainable and clean water supply for our local communities.\n\nThe Committee has continued to thoroughly monitor management's efforts to ensure the safe operation of tailings storage facilities (TSFs). Several key milestones were passed during the year, including Board approval of the Tailings Policy and Commitments for Responsible Tailings Management, clearly establishing roles, responsibilities, and duties of the different participants of the TSFs management system. Management also approved the Tailings Management System's Corporate Tailings Guidelines, with this governance framework being successfully implemented across all mining units. Finally, Operation, Maintenance and Surveillance (OMS) Manuals as well as Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans (EPRPs) have been issued by all mining units and integrated into current procedures and existing plans. Potential Failure Mode Assessments (PFMA), which focus on prevention of major risks, also continue to progress. Management has plans for investments to improve the safety of TSFs. Overall, the Company's actions not only demonstrate our compliance and commitment to industry best practices, but further consolidate accountable and responsible TSF operations.\n\nClimate change is a formidable challenge for our era, and the Committee diligently monitored the Company's progress towards achieving its 75% renewable energy target by 2030. We are pleased to report that by carrying out adjustments in the Company's energy portfolio, we successfully secured 53.3% renewables in the overall electricity supply during 2023. This achievement has restored the trajectory back onto its intended course, despite substantial increases in energy demand driven by expanding operations and setbacks in previous periods, including regulatory headwinds. Additionally, the Company\n\ncontinued to evolve the climate-risk assessment in the enterprise risk framework (ERM), revaluating the shortlist of climaterelated risks and opportunities (CROs) and strengthening the scenario analysis, demonstrating Fresnillo's commitment towards operational resilience.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, we anticipate seeing results from the regional climate modelling and the decarbonisation roadmap studies. We aim to thoroughly analyse these studies to extract valuable insights that will support the development of a pragmatic, clear and feasible decarbonisation pathway, balancing economic realities, current technological limitations and regulatory uncertainty.\n\nThe HSECR Committee is determined to conduct a comprehensive assessment of matters under its remit and to advance the Company's ESG strategy and overall performance. As we move forward, our institutional practices will stand as a testament to the Company's unwavering and ongoing dedication to constructing a more sustainable business model in collaboration with its key stakeholders.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez\n\nChairman, Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations Committee\n\n## Role of the Committee\n\nThe role and duties of the HSECR Committee are set out in its terms of reference, a copy of which can be found on the Company's website.\n\n## HSECR Committee membership\n\nMr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez (Chairman), Dame Judith Macgregor, Mr Fernando Ruiz and Ms Georgina Kessel.\n\nKey contributors: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, CEO Engineering Services (Pe\u00f1oles-Baluarte), Health, Safety and Environment Assistant VP (Pe\u00f1oles-Baluarte), Sustainability and Community Relations VP (Pe\u00f1olesBaluarte), Safety and Environment Assistant VP, General Counsel, Health Corporate Manager, Community Relations Manager and ESG Compliance Manager.\n\n## HSECR Committee Activity\n\nDuring the year, the Committee met in accordance with its terms of reference.",

During the year, we made good progress in our wellbeing programmes, underlining our commitment to employee physical and mental health, as well as promoting nutrition, sports and healthy habits. Our safety record has fallen short of our recent pledges to eliminate fatalities and reduce our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) to ICMM's ranges.

A systematic approach to HSECR management enables us to provide pertinent information to top management, fostering long-term success and creating opportunities to contribute to sustainable development. Each unit defines HSECR requirements with clear guidelines for implementation and assessment; the system establishes measurable goals, objectives and programmes, defining procedures for measurement, monitoring, and improvement, as well as periodic audits and reviews by top management.\n\n## Social-compatibility strategy\n\nLast year marked the implementation of a comprehensive strategy, collaboratively executed both internally and in coordination with our Parent Company, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles. This strategic initiative is designed to foster trust within society while ensuring the enduring success of our business. At its core, the strategy focuses on enhancing ESG performance in alignment with national and international standards and addresses the evolving demands of stakeholders and society at large, consolidating our approach to ESG.\n\nTo facilitate the effective implementation of this strategy, we have established a robust governance structure, comprising an Executive Committee, a Technical Committee, and ESG networks, along with associated working groups.

We expect our workforce and related third parties to consistently embody and adhere to these standards and to our Code of Conduct.\n\nTo further promote ethical decisionmaking and align our behaviour with our overall strategy, in 2013 we began a journey to embed ethics into our organisational culture, implementing a framework known as 'Step-Up' culture: in the first phase (20132016), our objective was the reduction of behavioural risk - the gap between intended, expressed and actual behaviours. The second phase (2016-present) has focused on raising awareness and developing the ethical decision-making competencies of our workforce.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted a comprehensive review of our Code of Ethics and Conduct, streamlining and categorising all aspects related to legal and regulatory compliance. This included crucial matters such as the prevention of money laundering, safeguarding personal data and contracting specialised services in alignment with the Mexican labour reform, that although already embedded within internal policies, required further clarification and transparency. As an additional measure, we also introduced a provision requiring our personnel to decline any gifts from third parties.

As a result of our latest exercise, we have generated initiatives that we will roll-out during 2024 to strengthen our ethical culture and integrity practices in the following years.\n\n## Training and capacity building\n\nOur Compliance programme and communications aim to foster a desired set of culture and behaviours within the Company and our stakeholders.\n\nOur workforce undergoes mandatory online training to set expectations for desired behaviours. During the period, we held an integrity-related onboarding workshop for new generations of Engineers in Training, with additional workshops addressing key integrity and compliance matters across different areas and business units in the Fresnillo district: regulatory compliance, conflicts of interest and harassment prevention. In addition, we delivered periodic compulsory courses on:\n\n- \u00b7 Our Code of Conduct (the 'Code'): onboarding session covering key compliance policies - such as donations, political contributions, promotional expenses, government relations, and the use of the whistleblowing line - and an annual evaluation and endorsement of the Code, requiring a declaration of potential conflicts of interest; in 2023, we introduced an interactive form facilitating a user-friendly experience while ensuring a more efficient means of storing data for subsequent processing.\n- \u00b7 Labour and Sexual Harassment: designed for non-unionised workers and covering fundamental concepts around harassment, emphasising our zero-tolerance stance. The course also provides guidance on the reporting mechanism for any situations they may experience or witness.\n\nWe also conduct permanent campaigns to engage our entire workforce through various channels, such as emails, posters, infographics, videos, computer screensavers and a dedicated internal portal for ethics and compliance topics to ensure that key aspects of our Code of Conduct and internal policies are effectively communicated and understood. Dissemination efforts in 2023 included:\n\n- \u00b7 Awareness of cybersecurity.\n- \u00b7 Knowledge of gifts and services.\n- \u00b7 Semi-annual statistics on the whistleblowing mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Education on the right of access, rectification, cancellation, and opposition of the holders regarding their personal data (ARCO rights).\n- \u00b7 Recognition of conflicts of interest.\n- \u00b7 Endorsement of the 2023 commitment to integrity.\n\nFor third parties in our value chain including owners, legal representatives and residents - we also provided online workshops, covering essential topics to enable alignment with our integrity policy, organisational values and Third-Party Code of Conduct. Subjects included human rights responsibility, due diligence, conflicts of interest, bribery and corruption, expected behaviours and our whistleblowing mechanism.\n\nMoving forward, our commitment remains unwavering. We will persist in our efforts to prioritise the wellbeing of our people through ongoing training, addressing grievances promptly, dispelling myths surrounding workplace culture, fortifying our organisational values and actively encouraging the use of our various reporting channels, with a particular emphasis on our whistleblowing mechanism. Through these measures, we aim to sustain a workplace where every individual feels heard, respected and secure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Harassment Prevention programme\n\nIn line with our purpose to enhance the wellbeing of people, we believe that a positive work environment not only contributes to overall wellbeing but also significantly influences productivity. The Harassment Prevention programme serves as a cornerstone for fostering this positive environment. Through comprehensive training, we provide our workforce with the tools to effectively identify, prevent, and report workplace and sexual harassment. The delivery of face-to-face awareness workshops has also played a crucial role in establishing trust in the whistleblowing mechanism.\n\nThese workshops go beyond traditional training methods; they actively cultivate a welcoming and inclusive space for the exchange of ideas and experiences through hands-on activities and group dynamics, empowering them to effectively address harassment. The impact of these workshops is evident as attendees often respond positively, challenging and re-evaluating ingrained norms such as chauvinism or genderbased violence. Importantly, participants gain new perspectives and strategies to constructively address these issues.\n\nDuring 2023, we conducted workshops for 4,732 employees and contractors. This ongoing effort ensures that every member of our team is well-versed in the Company's stance on workplace and sexual harassment since onboarding, fostering a collective commitment to maintaining a safe and respectful workplace.\n\n## Onboarding Harrassment Prevention programme for new personnel, 2023\n\n| Business unit   | People   |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| Fresnillo       | 1,471    |\n| Juanicipio      | 1,382    |\n| Saucito         | 1,357    |\n| San Juli\u00e1n      | 231      |\n| Ci\u00e9nega         | 208      |\n| New projects    | 66       |\n| Penmont         | 17       |\n| Total           | 4,732    |",

It is operated by Ethics Global, an external third-party provider, which ensures the anonymity of whistleblowers when filing a report. The whistleblowing mechanism is widely available to our employees, contractors, and other stakeholders such as suppliers and members of surrounding communities. The reports received are reviewed quarterly by the Honour Commission and monitored by the Audit Committee. Twice a year, the Board of Directors also receives reports at meetings.\n\nWe recently conducted a third-party survey to assess employee trust in the whistleblowing mechanism. Leveraging these insights, we developed a comprehensive plan aimed at enhancing the reception, handling and resolution of reports related to unethical conduct. The overarching goal is to reduce risks associated to information leakage, reprisals and to foster improved communication with the potential whistleblowers who utilise any reporting channel for violations to our Codes of Ethics and/or Conduct. This plan will be implemented during 2024, featuring a campaign disseminating key aspects such as confidentiality, protection against retaliation and how to effectively collaborate in an investigation. Additionally,\n\n## 2023 cases\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwe will also target workshops to strengthen the capabilities of key departments that are frequently featured in such reports.\n\nIn 2023, we observed an increase in complaints related to labour and sexual harassment compared to the previous year. We attribute this result to the continued dissemination of our reporting mechanisms and, notably, the growing trust among our personnel to report instances of workplace harassment. We anticipate this trend will continue into 2024, supported by the project to enhance trust in the whistleblowing mechanism.\n\n| Type                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Labour harassment                         | 66     | 43     |\n| Sexual  harassment                        | 23     | 11     |\n| Inappropriate arrangements with suppliers | 21     | 15     |\n| Abuse of authority                        | 19     | 17     |\n| Other                                     | 11     | 3      |\n| Non-compliance with internal policy       | 8      | 7      |\n| Conflict of interest                      | 5      | 6      |\n| Professional  negligence                  | 5      | 4      |\n| Unsafe conditions                         | 4      | -      |\n| Fraud                                     | 1      | -      |\n| Misuse of assets                          | -      | 3      |\n| Breach of trust                           | -      | 2      |\n| Inappropriate behaviour at work           | -      | 2      |\n| Total                                     | 163    | 113    |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ethical Conduct KPIs\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Continue our efforts to eliminate all forms of workplace violence, raising awareness to prevent labour and sexual harassment, and strengthening confidence in our whistleblowing mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Roll-out a Company-wide dissemination campaign highlighting key elements for whistleblowing along with workshops to enhance capabilities in key departments that often feature in such reports.\n- Whistleblowing - Number of reports\n\nWhistleblowing - Number of cases\n\n- Tone from the top - Number of reports related to managers\n- Discipline - Number of disciplinary actions\n- Discipline - Number of control reinforcement\n- \u00b7 Permanent 'tone from the top' dissemination campaigns on ethics culture and compliance.\n- \u00b7 Third-party periodic evaluations of the ethics culture and compliance programmes.",

Inspired by our purpose to contribute to the wellbeing of people through the sustainable mining of silver and gold, we prioritise the promotion of best practices on human rights due diligence, which includes the identification, mitigation and remediation of any negative impacts on human rights.\n\nAt the core of Fresnillo's commitment to being a responsible business and an employer of choice lies our profound dedication to our people.

These efforts encompass processes, areas and individuals responsible for maintaining an anti-bribery and anti-corruption stance due to their nature or high level of exposure. Disciplinary measures for individuals involved directly or indirectly in bribery and corruption, including third parties, may range from legal measures to the termination of their employment contract, in the case of our workforce, or termination of business relationships in the case of third parties.\n\nIn 2023, we enhanced processes and documented procedures to ensure compliance with external regulations across various subjects and operational processes.

Following the 2022 third-party anti-bribery and corruption programme verification, we developed an action plan to implement improvement in high-risk processes, updating procedures for construction and services contracting, procurement, due diligence and financial operations. The significance of regulatory compliance and its value to the organisation has been effectively communicated through the 'Compliance Matters' campaign. Additionally, a 2024 training plan is in place for high-risk areas.\n\nSince 2013, we have conducted ethical due diligence that precedes any business relationship and is tailored to the specific risks and characteristics of each party. Continuous compliance monitoring is carried out, and adjustments to arrangements with third parties are made as needed. If risks cannot be mitigated, business relationships are suspended.\n\nIn 2023, we successfully implemented new software to automate and optimise the third-party due diligence process. This transformation and standardisation considers the criticality of each third-party category with a risk-based approach, enabling us to efficiently detect alerts and establish a precise methodology for quantifying risk levels. The software facilitates informed decision-making regarding the initiation and continuation of business relationships with third parties. It also enhances greater traceability in operations with third parties, reduces response times, and streamlines the process for both external partners and internal personnel.

Maintaining a pervasive awareness of cybersecurity at all organisational levels is integral to our strategy, and we focus on updating and strengthening cybersecurity in alignment with our strategic objectives.\n\nWe employ various methods to foster and elevate our cybersecurity culture, including workshops, communications, campaigns and exercises. Our collaborative ethos extends to working closely with information technology departments, contributing to the definition and establishment of best practices and security standards. This collaborative effort ensures that our business processes, powered by technological innovation, adhere to the highest standards of security and reliability. In parallel, our cybersecurity governance initiatives actively enhance our regulatory capabilities to meet the diverse compliance requirements applicable to our Company.\n\nDuring the period, we laid robust foundations for adherence to the Mexican Federal Law for the Protection of Personal Data in Possession of Private Parties (LFPDPPP). We successfully completed the second phase of a third-party audit of our personal data management system, a significant stride towards achieving certification across our business units.\n\nIn line with our commitment to safeguarding information, we also plan to renew our cybersecurity governance framework, building upon the three lines of defence model. This approach will engage all levels and areas of our business.\n\n## Government payment transparency\n\nMining can drive economic and social progress when carried out responsibly.

We prioritise maintaining a corporate culture deeply rooted in ethics and a genuine concern for our people's wellbeing. This commitment extends to respecting labour rights, engaging in constructive dialogue with union representatives and embracing diversity in our workforce, comprising unionised employees, non-unionised employees and contractors.\n\nCommencing with a breakdown of the workforce composition based on age groups and employment categories, the data reveals relatively similar percentages for non-unionised and unionised employees, and contractors, with the largest group being people over 30 and below 50 (56.8%), then people below 30 (35.7%), and finally, people above 50 (7.5%).\n\nOver the years, we have made substantial strides in gender diversity, steadily increasing the percentage of women in our workforce, reaching 11.88% in 2023, up from 9.73% in 2019. We continue to close the gap on the country average, which currently stands at 17.3% according to data from the Mexican Mining Chamber. While proud of our progress, we acknowledge there is more work to be done. For a detailed overview of our strategies to foster female talent, refer to the Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion section on pages 96-97.\n\nDuring the period we experienced an 8.9% decrease in our total workforce, motivated by the administrative reorganisation that was undertaken to achieve efficiencies and cost reductions, as well as the workforce consolidation at the Herradura district following the progressive closure of mine operations at Noche Buena, thus affecting both the labour turnover figures compared to its historical trend and our share of women in the workforce. We expect these trends to stabilise in the future.\n\n|                                           | Men    | Women   | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------|\n| Employees  (unionised and  non-unionised) | 6,254  | 1,006   | 7,260   |\n| Senior  managers                          | 151    | 14      | 165     |\n| Contractors                               | 11,173 | 1,343   | 12,516  |\n| Total  workforce                          | 17,427 | 2,349   | 19,776  |\n\n## Engaging our people\n\nWe administer biennial engagement surveys employing the Basher methodology to monitor organisational climate. It encompasses 60 items across seven key areas to evaluate employee and contractor satisfaction. The survey employs a dual evaluation scale, combining responses with the relevance they hold for each individual. The outcomes undergo comprehensive analysis across different cohorts, leading to discussions among leadership teams and relevant departments. Areas with the lowest scores, as well as specific items, are pinpointed and incorporated into existing programmes or integrated as focal points of new improvement plans.\n\n## Topics:\n\n## Cohorts analysed:\n\n- \u00b7 Our working practices.\n- \u00b7 Process/Department.\n- \u00b7 Industrial safety.\n- \u00b7 Organisational roles.\n- \u00b7 Code of Conduct and compliance.\n- \u00b7 Age groups.\n- \u00b7 Management and leadership.\n- \u00b7 Seniority.\n- \u00b7 Work environment.\n- \u00b7 Gender.\n- \u00b7 Trust.\n- \u00b7 Key personnel.\n- \u00b7 Teamwork.\n\n## Workforce composition, by contract\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Contractors\n- Unionised employees\n- Non-unionised employees\n\n## Workforce composition, by age\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Percentage of women, by group\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Manager and senior executive positions\n- Employees (unionised and nonunionised)\n- Contractors\n\n## Labour turnover\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Voluntary labour turnover\n- Total turnover\n\nLabour turnover includes unionised and non-unionised personnel.\n\nTo unlock the full potential of our workforce and maximise their contribution, we are dedicated to cultivating a supportive work culture that encourages inclusion, creativity, innovation and collaboration.

These programmes facilitate valuable knowledge transfer, expertise sharing and serve as a catalyst for inspiration and engagement. For area managers and supervisors, the emphasis is on immediate tools for effective team management and instigating a change in attitudes and behaviours. Middle managers benefit from programmes that hone leadership skills and refine technical competencies in mining, planning, mineral processing and managerial soft skills. Executive programmes concentrate on enhancing competencies in finance, accounting, human resources, corporate social responsibility and leadership. These programmes, including Leadership Plus, Leaders with Vision, Leaders in\n\nTraining, BAL Managerial Diploma and Capital Project Diploma, are conducted in collaboration with the prestigious Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM).\n\nOur commitment to individual performance appraisal and formal feedback remains unwavering. This process not only enables us to identify specific training needs but also serves as a key tool for pinpointing promising candidates for our institutional development programmes at different organisational levels. During the year, we maintained an average of 64 training hours per worker, including an average of 28 hours on HSECR training.\n\n## Case study\n\n## Training the engineers of the future\n\nIn partnership with premier Mexican educational institutions - such as the Autonomous University of Zacatecas (UAZ), the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), the Guanajuato University and the Technological Institute of Le\u00f3n (ITL), among others - we actively seek out and nurture a diverse array of young professionals specialising in mining, geology, metallurgy and a range of engineering fields in the early stages of their academic journey. Over the last six years, we have seen a total of 529 engineers graduate through this scheme, and our current retention rate stands at 80.3%.

It allowed me to reinforce my academic foundations and equipped me with essential professional skills. I am convinced that some skills and insights can only be acquired through hands-on experience, and I was lucky to be guided by mentors rich in expertise and eager to share their wisdom. I am eternally grateful to my mentors, who were not just technical and professional advisers but also life mentors, showing me how to grow and develop both professionally and personally. '\n\nAdriana Arroyo, Mining Operations Centre Superintendent\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Engineers in Training programme has been a cornerstone in developing my technical, administrative and interpersonal skills, offering me a comprehensive overview of the Company's value chain.

Reflecting on this time brings both nostalgia and deep appreciation, as I was involved in key projects at San Juli\u00e1n mine. The programme's structured approach to learning and mentorship were crucial in motivating me, instilling the confidence to foresee a promising career trajectory within the Company. Furthermore, I wish to express my gratitude towards the programme's counterparts for their patience and willingness to share knowledge and experience, a practice that significantly enriches our organisational culture.'\n\nTania Pineda, Mining Operations Centre Superintendent\n\n## Labour relations\n\nUnions play a pivotal role in our commitment to enhancing productivity and fostering a robust safety culture. We believe that maintaining fair and respectful relationships with unions is essential to building trust and mutual accountability. Our approach is centred on upholding workers' rights to freedom of expression, free association and collective bargaining. We actively engage with unions through regular dialogue, leadership development initiatives and wellbeing programmes including sports and cultural events - as well as collaborative projects focused on continuous improvement to reinforce our partnership ethos.\n\nRegular interactions take place between the CEO, Head of HR and union senior leadership, while at the operational level, our business units maintain close ties with local union committees and delegates. These engagements underscore our dedication to open communication and foster collaboration for capacity-building initiatives, particularly for newly elected committees. Annual Safety Symposiums, conducted in partnership with unions and authorities, provide a platform for exchanging best practices and promoting meaningful discussions on industry challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we partner with unions to conduct the 'LEAL' survey on work behaviours and\n\nStrategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwellbeing, leveraging insights to enhance our workforce engagement strategy.\n\nIn 2023, operations at Herradura mine experienced a temporary suspension following an illegal stoppage by a very small group of unionised personnel. The stoppage prevented site access for other workers, and was not approved by the union, nor supported by the vast majority of unionised workers at Herradura, with whom we have a very constructive and long-term relationship. This situation was rapidly resolved with no significant impact to the operations at Herradura.",

We understand that equity and inclusion are catalysts for talent attraction, retention and development, fostering innovation and creativity. Upholding the principle of equality, we strive to create a workplace where everyone enjoys equal opportunities and is treated with respect. Our emphasis on openness, belonging and respect establishes a supportive environment, enabling each individual to make a meaningful impact.\n\nOur dedication to advancing diversity and inclusivity begins with a focus on increasing the representation and participation of women, recognising the inherent competitive advantage in embracing diversity. To achieve this, we have set two key objectives:\n\n- 1. Enhance the contribution of women to the success of the Company.\n- 2.  Have a positive impact on female employees.\n\nIn 2020, we committed to raising the overall representation of women in our workforce from 10% to 12% by 2025 and breaking the glass ceiling at the operating manager and superintendent levels, with the aim of increasing the percentage of women in these roles from 2% to 8% by 2025. In recent years, the Company has made significant strides in improving both indicators, although considerable reconfigurations to our workforce initiated in 2023 saw an 8.9% overall decrease in headcount and shifted the organic historical trends in gender diversity. We expect the figures to stabilise during 2024, and will continue to keep them under review, seeking to expand our female representation in the future including in our senior management and leadership roles.\n\nSince 2019, we have actively embraced the Women's Empowerment Principles established by the UN Global Compact and UN Women. In 2020, we entered the PAR Ranking, the largest ranking system in Latin America measuring gender equality performance.

As a strategic initiative, our senior executives underwent targeted training on preventing labour and sexual harassment, facilitated by an external consultancy. The Virtual Campus also played a pivotal role by delivering 188 microlearning capsules on discrimination and DEI to employees, contributing to a more informed and inclusive workplace culture.\n\nOn our female talent development strategy front, we launched the call for the second generation of the Womento-Women Mentorship programme and activated a network of women in our\n\nworkplaces in the Torre\u00f3n and Mexico City Headquarters to create a safe and trusting space; we expect to be able to replicate these across all mining units. In partnership with the Mexican Mining Chamber, we also promoted the first Women in the Mining Industry 2023 survey, aiming to understand the development of female talent and the benefits their expertise and professionalism bring to companies, with 1,230 women participating in total across the country.\n\nWe also achieved significant progress in advancing disability inclusion initiatives during the year. We conducted 'Inclusive Leadership' training, led by \u00c9ntrale, a leading advocate for the labour inclusion of individuals with disabilities, specifically\n\ntailored to sensitise senior leadership to the importance of fostering an inclusive workplace. Another noteworthy accomplishment was the completion of the initial phase of mapping our workforce's disabilities: through a survey involving 980 participants, we identified essential accommodations and adjustments for optimal performance. This process also led to the establishment of criteria, protocols, processes, and formats for the implementation of these accommodations. Furthermore, we conducted training for recruitment personnel, emphasising inclusive practices to mitigate unconscious biases and prioritise the selection of candidates based on their abilities and job requirements,\n\nwe launched our Women's Leadership programme. Our commitment continued in 2022, with dedicated efforts to enact recommendations from both diagnostics, strategically outlined in a DEI masterplan. This master plan is built across three pillars, containing several priority initiatives:\n\n## Total percentage of women\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Glass ceiling\n\n<!-- image -->",

The goal is to enhance awareness and cultivate a more inclusive society and workplace environment. In the 2023 edition, the University of Sonora played an active role, contributing valuable insights to the discussions by involving\n\nboth teachers and students. These twoday workshops and conferences cater to a diverse audience, including students, teachers, physiotherapists, physicians, psychologists, individuals with disabilities and the general public. They are designed to equip participants with tools for early interventions that contribute to the holistic growth and fulfilment of individuals with disabilities.\n\n## Gender Pay Gap\n\nWe are committed to paying an equal wage for an equal job. Based on salary scales, we have policies in place to close the gender pay gap. In 2023, the gender pay gap for non-unionised, non-executive employees was -3.12% compared to -3.59% in 2022.

Our goal was to nurture a culture of comprehensive wellness that supports the balance of work, family and personal life.\n\nThe campaign featured two webinars led by doctors specialising in the field. The first, titled 'Breastfeeding for the working mother: A holistic wellness approach' and the second, 'Work and breastfeeding: Making it possible', were made available to all our workforce. Additionally, the campaign also highlighted the benefits of breastfeeding through both printed and digital posters, and provided guidance on how to successfully express, store and transport breast milk, mindful of the challenges faced by our female workers in remote locations.\n\nThis initiative underscores our commitment to our employees' wellbeing, and dedication to creating an inclusive and supportive work environment that values and supports the health of the mothers in our workforce as well as their children.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Our goal is clear - operating without fatal accidents, minimising exposure to risk, preventing harm to people and damage to assets, while maintaining an ethical and safe work environment, with strong and visible leadership at all organisational levels.\n\nPrevention is at the heart of our safety culture, supported by our 'I Care, We Care' philosophy. Spanning from exploration to operations, this approach addresses all inherent risks by promoting five strategic lines of action: leadership, accountability, risk competencies for both behaviours and systems and cross-functional learning. These pillars aim to establish critical and performance controls in every operation, making all personnel responsible for verifying standards and identifying gaps. This empowerment ensures a continuous cycle of improvement, effectively reducing risks through the right tools and training.\n\nSince its inception in 2017, 'I Care, We Care' has evolved and steadily improved. The technical components prioritise critical risks - those with the potential for fatalities or serious harm to individuals - while the operational framework ensures that all risks are systematically addressed; it enables a comprehensive risk management strategy and continuous innovation in safety practices, risk management and emergency readiness. Since 2021, we have also implemented the process of reporting near-misses - which identify missed or failed critical controls that could lead to harm - to promote a proactive approach to management and encourage worker involvement in an early warning system, thereby monitoring operational safety and facilitating timely decision-making.\n\nThe 'I Care, We Care' cycle\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 'I Care, We Care' strategic pillars\n\n- 1.

This includes their verification, proper deployment and the practice of visible leadership both in the field and through active participation and engagement of workers at every organisational level. We have various mechanisms in place for identifying and assessing risks and establishing controls, all with an operational focus and with the aim of minimising risks in the execution of activities in the field.\n\n- \u00b7 For general risks, each operating unit carries out the process based on the NOM-023-STPS-2012 standard. For routine activities, employees and business partners use general tools to evaluate risk and establish controls; for non-routine activities, we deploy the Safe Work Analysis mechanism, permits and authorisations for high-risk work.\n- \u00b7 Our approach to critical risks begins with the Workplace Risk Assessment and Control (WRAC), prepared by the leadership team of each operating unit. This is followed by a bow-tie analysis to identify and review the controls with the goal of avoiding or mitigating the risk, carried out with risk owners, critical control owners and risk experts. This analysis leads to critical control verification tools: a checklist before\n\ninitiation of critical risk associated activities, performance standards, the establishment of parameters and quality criteria to guarantee critical controls, and a portfolio of critical risks derived from their previous identification and evaluation.\n\n## Leadership in the field\n\nAt Fresnillo, we uphold safety as a 'Life Value' through our commitment to valuesdriven visible leadership. Responsibility and accountability are ingrained at every level of our organisation.\n\nWe systematically deliver leadership programmes in the field for all leaders, from facilitators to management teams, with a focus on instilling values into their actions and leading by example. This ensures control and verification of the implementation of critical risks and their respective critical controls, contributing to the strengthening of the preventive culture and visible leadership.\n\nFurthermore, our leadership practices aim to empower people by enabling them to take responsibility for their right and their obligation to halt any unsafe activity resulting from the absence or failure of critical controls. This empowerment persists until the situation is corrected or until safe operation is ensured.\n\n2023 marked a significant step in the implementation of leadership practices, symbolised by the delivery of the leadership standard, which lays out our leaders' expected behaviours and tasks. This initiative, guided by our Chairman and CEO, aims to fortify our preventive safety culture, and was endorsed by senior management. This endorsement process was replicated across all business units to ensure widespread deployment and dissemination.\n\n## Participation\n\nAt all levels of the organisation, our workforce has various roles and responsibilities to support our safety strategy and actively participate in hazard identification, risk assessment and controlestablishment processes. Specialists are assigned to all operations and projects to train, guide and advise our workforce on safety management. We utilise various forms of collaboration and participation, such as committees, health and safety commissions, and emergency teams, to carry out safety-focused activities such as training and risk management projects to enhance our safety culture. Hand-inhand with the union, our Health and Safety Committees, or business partner committees, also conduct facility safety inspections to identify hazards and unsafe practices, make suggestions for preventive measures and conduct accident investigations.",

Led by our operational leaders, the committee comprises general operational superintendents, service area leaders with an impact on risk control, technical specialists from various disciplines related to risks and safety leaders. The committee's objective is to manage workplace safety risks, challenges and opportunities; track and report safety performance; implement clear, compatible corporate guidelines; monitor and follow-up on risk verifications according to our leadership standards; conduct in-depth verifications; and foster cross-functional learning. Throughout 2023, this committee held monthly sessions, conducted leadership field practices and symbolically endorsed the leadership standard.\n\n## Throughout 2023, safety meetings were held with key business partners;\n\nmanagement teams from each mining unit, along with our partners' key representatives, collaboratively engaged to align their operational standards, performance reporting and evaluation with our 'I Care, We Care' programme. During these engagement sessions, safety opportunities were addressed collaboratively and cross-functional learning cases presented for implementation.\n\n2023 also saw the 11th Safety Symposium take place in Fresnillo, Zacatecas. This unprecedented event served as a key forum for communication, reflection and training in safety - and it brought together the union, the Company, business partners and authorities. At this event, agreements were reached with the National Miners and Metallurgists' Union FRENTE to reinforce the synergy between each local executive committee and business unit leaders, and to strengthen safety culture through the implementation of leadership practices. The event drew 816 attendees over three days, representing all union sections from seven Mexican states.\n\n## Training\n\nWe maintain our firm belief in developing competencies to underpin our safety culture, covering safety induction, regulatory courses, risk analysis, risk control protocols, operational procedures, practices for high-risk tasks, permits and authorisations, safety management, hazardous material handling, business goals, preventive safety tools, brigade training and accident investigations using\n\n## Certifications\n\n|                                                                                                  | Juanicipio                                                                                       | San Juli\u00e1n                                                                                       | Fresnillo                                                                                        | Saucito                                                                                          | Ci\u00e9nega                                                                                          | Herradura                                                                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            | OHSAS 18001/ISO 45001                                                                            |\n| Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. | Sets out criteria for international best practice in occupational health and safety  management. |\n|                                                                                                  | -                                                                                                | -                                                                                                | Certified                                                                                        | Certified                                                                                        | -                                                                                                | Certified                                                                                        |\n\nvarious methodologies, among others. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the professionalism of our workforce through certification in competency standards accredited by the National Council for Standardization and Certification of Labour Competencies (CONOCER). We also maintain emergency response teams trained in mine rescue, firefighting, first aid, hazardous materials handling and evacuation. For a detailed overview of our training and development strategies, refer to Our culture section on pages 92-95.\n\nAs part of our commitment to strengthen the safety culture, we have also established a synergistic relationship with the National Miners and Metallurgists Union, FRENTE. Together, we engage in coordinated efforts to champion skills development through immersive workshops tailored for local committee members, newcomers and aspiring individuals.\n\n## Certifications and awards\n\nWe hold safety related certifications relevant for our industry in our mining units, such as ISO 45001, and the International Cyanide Management Code; refer to Protecting our environment section for more information on the Code. For the third consecutive year, Centauro Profundo received the 'Jorge Rangel Zamorano' Silver Helmet award for its safety performance in the category 'Underground mining - up to 500 workers', granted by the Mexican Mining Chamber.\n\n## Performance\n\nThe executive team is committed to safeguarding our people and promoting zero harm. To this end, our 2026 vision is to achieve zero fatalities and decrease our TRIFR to International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) standards. Furthermore, we aim to minimise individuals' risk exposure, protect assets, and use advanced technology to increase preventive reporting and enable proactive decision-making - such as critical control automation, software to ensure proper scaling and safety analytics, among others.\n\nWe have continued to mature our preventive reporting (near misses), identifying failed or missing critical controls. These instances, which do not represent energy release or damage, allow operational leaders to promptly address potential hazards to individuals or equipment. In addition to its management focus, our cultural objective is to ensure workers' participation in an early warning system, enabling them to understand the safety environment and make timely decisions. In 2023, we generated 34,638 near miss reports, marking a 75% increase compared in 2022, showcasing the significant progress in our preventive reporting efforts.\n\nWhile our safety performance has exhibited a positive trend in recent years, we deeply regret that four colleagues tragically lost their lives while performing their operational duties - one unionised worker and three contractors. We recognise that maturing our safety culture is an ongoing journey and that these disappointing incidents underscore the urgent need for a top-down, organisationwide approach to prevent recurrence. We are resolute in our determination to foster a disciplined application of controls, enhance leadership qualities, and improve accountability processes at every level.\n\nOur foremost priority is to safeguard the most invaluable asset - the lives, safety and integrity of our workforce. Our response to fatalities has been to implement a series of contingency, control and improvement measures, with a focus on addressing organisational root causes. Noteworthy actions include:\n\n- \u00b7 Conducting thorough investigations using the Incident Cause Analysis Method (ICAM) to guarantee more meticulous analysis and an enhanced focus on organisational causes. Currently, corrective actions are being implemented across our operations to reinforce engineering controls, personnel competencies, and improve the application and verification of critical controls in the field, along with strengthening the accountability process.",

This risk detection technology and its ability to predict potential failures proved its true value in 2018, following the impact of Hurricane Rosa, a Category 4 hurricane. The radar systems detected all ground movements and enabled us to develop a comprehensive equipment\n\nrelocation strategy that guaranteed 'zero damage'.\n\nToday, Penmont boasts a fleet of 11 stateof-the-art radar systems, safeguarding 94% of the entire pit area and earning Penmont its reputation as the mining operation with the most extensive coverage in Mexico. The radar-based detection, monitoring, alerting and control system is operated around the clock, 365 days a year, generating automated reports and a wealth of data to support predictive analysis. The technology also significantly enhances decision-making processes regarding operational timings and methods (when and how to operate), contributing to both productivity and safety.\n\nEmbracing a culture of continuous improvement and the sharing of best practices, Penmont has also become the first mine in Mexico to install slope stability radar systems at its tailings storage facilities. This proactive approach to safety has culminated in Penmont achieving a 'zero events/ zero accidents' record related to slope stability, underlining its leadership in the implementation of advanced safety measures in our country's mining industry.",

Our comprehensive approach extends across several aspects of workplace health, supported by a multidisciplinary focus through specialists in the health sector and organisational development. This collaborative effort aims to continually enhance our processes, ensuring the preservation of the physical and mental health of our workforce.\n\nOur strategic framework encompasses emergency preparedness, the promotion of healthy habits, and the early detection and management of health risks, effectively preventing both occupational and chronic diseases. To mitigate these risks, we meticulously establish operating procedures, provide necessary equipment and training, and implement controls.\n\nPrior to joining our workforce, individuals undergo a thorough health check that includes both physical and psychosocial evaluations. We also implement regular check-ups to screen for occupational diseases, and workers receive guidance on preventive care measures. We actively monitor exposure levels to physical and chemical risks, such as noise, dust, vibration, heavy metal contamination and extreme temperatures, and conduct biological monitoring to prevent sanitary risks. Behavioural change workshops are organised to promote personal wellbeing and prevent accidents and workplace stress. Additionally, we continually assess and enhance the ergonomics of our work environment to prevent musculoskeletal disorders and operate rehabilitation facilities to expedite recovery from workplace injuries.\n\nExternal audits of the health and safety management system are conducted regularly at the Fresnillo, Saucito and Penmont units, with the aim of strengthening and continually enhancing our processes. To ensure accountability, heads of medical services participate in a structured mechanism and present results during end-of-month meetings; these sessions also serve as forums to reach agreements and establish commitments, contributing to the overall efficacy of our health and safety measures.\n\nIn recent years, our health departments have evolved to embrace a more holistic perspective that extends beyond occupational health programmes. Our\n\n## Five comprehensive health courses of action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nhealth plans and programmes emphasise comprehensive wellbeing, addressing both physical and mental health promoting nutrition, sports and healthy habits, psychological care, wellness in the workplace and at home - as well as focusing on hygiene, ergonomics, health surveillance, women's health and implementation of health-oriented technologies in the workplace. Aligned with our 'I Care, We Care' programme, this health management system addresses five main courses of action.\n\nIn line with our commitment to workforce wellbeing and operational efficiency, we initiated a groundbreaking ergonomics committee pilot in Herradura during 2023. This marked the beginning of our broader plan to establish ergonomics committees across all mining units. Over the next two years, we plan to implement a comprehensive training programme encompassing six strategic initiatives, ranging from early diagnosis to the establishment of processes for continual improvement:\n\n- 1. Historical review of work-related risks with ergonomic implications.\n- 2.  Specialised academic training in ergonomics for our industrial hygienists.\n- 3.  Development of a matrix for identifying ergonomic risks specific to mining units.\n- 4.  Analysis and evaluation of ergonomic risks within the mining unit.\n- 5.  Conveying the findings to the mining unit's leadership team.\n- 6.  Formation of a comprehensive ergonomics committee for ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement.\n\nAt the same time, our dedication to community health has continued through the regular deployment of our Community Health Weeks, a flagship programme renowned for its popularity and success among neighbouring communities. In collaboration with local and federal authorities, health agencies and the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) Foundation, we offer free dental care, eye care and physical therapy to our communities. In 2023, the programme had a positive impact on over 6,000 individuals across almost 200 communities. For a comprehensive overview of our Community Health Weeks and other health-related initiatives dedicated to our neighbouring communities, please refer to the Socioeconomic development segment in the Partnering with our communities section on pages 142-149.",

Two impactful master sessions, 'You are the key' and 'Living marvellously', emphasised the importance of wellness, self-care, and positive psychology. To complement these sessions, we organised information stands dedicated to the programme's dissemination, nutritional guidance, psychological education and physical therapy.\n\nFurthermore, to amplify our commitment to employee wellbeing, we established the Wellbeing Committee in 2023 to follow-up on initiatives regarding physical and mental health, sports, culture and social activities. This committee will be fully operational in 2024, overseeing additional courses of action within the 'Living in Balance' programme, including: i) Sleep hygiene, ii) Depression, iii) Anxiety, iv) Work-related stress, and v) Drivers of change.\n\nThrough these concerted efforts, the 'Living in Balance' programme not only addresses immediate concerns but also aligns seamlessly with our broader organisational strategy, reinforcing our commitment to cultivating a thriving and supportive workplace culture.",

To this end, we establish and maintain a HSECR management system, in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 and ISO 45001:2018 standards,\n\nincorporating environmental aspects, hazards, and risks.\n\nEach unit defines HSECR requirements with clear guidelines for implementation and assessment. This process establishes measurable goals, objectives and programmes, defining procedures for measurement, monitoring and\n\nimprovement as part of the system, as well as periodic internal and external audits and reviews by top management. Audits assess the adequacy and effectiveness of the implemented system and the fulfilment of defined objectives, while reviews analyse the state of the strategy and performance for decision-making purposes.\n\n## High level structure of our HSECR management system\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA systematic approach to environmental management enables us to provide pertinent information to top management, fostering long-term success and creating opportunities to contribute to sustainable development by:\n\n- \u00b7 Protecting the environment through the prevention or mitigation of adverse environmental impacts.\n- \u00b7 Mitigating potentially adverse effects of environmental conditions on the organisation.\n- \u00b7 Supporting the organisation in complying with legal and other requirements.\n- \u00b7 Improving environmental performance.\n\nBefore embarking on any mining project, a top priority is to carry out thorough Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs). These assessments meticulously identify potential impacts and outline the requisite actions for effective management. EIAs comprehensively address a spectrum of critical factors, encompassing surface and groundwater resources, water quality, air quality, soils, biodiversity (including threatened or endangered species), landscape and socioeconomic conditions. The valuable insights derived from these assessments serve as the cornerstone for the development of our environmental management plans and systems, including the adherence to ISO 14001 standards.\n\n## Certifications\n\n|                                                                                      |            |            |           |           |         | Penmont   | Penmont     |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|------------|-----------|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|\n| Certification/Award                                                                  | Juanicipio | San Juli\u00e1n | Fresnillo | Saucito   | Ci\u00e9nega | Herradura | Noche Buena |\n| ISO 14001                                                                            | -          | -          | Certified | Certified | -       | Certified | Certified   |\n| Framework and criteria for an effective   environmental management system.           |            |            |           |           |         |           |             |\n| International Cyanide Management Code                                                | -          | -          | -         | -         | -       | Certified | Certified   |\n| Sets criteria for the global gold mining industry   on cyanide management practices. |            |            |           |           |         |           |             |\n\n- \u00b7 Controlling or influencing how the organisation designs, manufactures, distributes, consumes and disposes of products or services, using a life cycle perspective to prevent environmental impacts from being inadvertently transferred to another stage of the life cycle.\n- \u00b7 Achieving financial and operational benefits resulting from implementing environmentally friendly alternatives that strengthen the organisation's market position.\n- \u00b7 Communicating environmental information to relevant stakeholders.",

Fuel and electricity are crucial in order to extract, process and transport minerals from deep within the earth to the final stages of production and, at times, initiating subsequent industrial processes. Vigilant monitoring of energy consumption, GHG emissions and their respective intensities per tonne of processed mineral are central to our commitment to sustainability. This rigorous oversight helps us to mitigate risks and also identify opportunities for resource efficiency that may contribute to business continuity and cost efficiency.\n\nWe have been steadily increasing our use of renewable energy in recent years, aiming to achieve 75% renewables in our energy mix by 2030. However, regulatory uncertainties have caused delays to new renewable energy sources which were due to come online. Waiting times for modifications to transmission permission agreements have become extended, and as a result, in 2022, we had to rely more on electricity from the Mexican power utility, Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), temporarily reducing our renewable energy consumption. This setback was resolved in 2023 through several measures: San Juli\u00e1n was reintegrated into the self-supply scheme with Coahuila Wind\n\nForce (EDC); one of Herradura's lines was migrated to the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), sourcing energy from Mesa La Paz Eolic windfarm through a Power Purchase Agreement; and Juanicipio and the Pyrites plant commenced operations late in 2022, also consuming electricity through the latter scheme. These developments enabled us to achieve 53.3% renewables, up from 35.6% in 2022 and representing a 59.9% increase in comparison to 2022, despite a 6.8% increase in average electricity demand.\n\n## Evolution in the share of renewable energy consumption in 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Renewable energy consumption by mine\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance\n\nIn 2023, 60% of our energy consumption came from fuels, mainly diesel and gasoline, while the remaining 40% was derived from electricity, 53.3% of which came from renewable energy. We also saw\n\nan overall increase in both energy intensity and GHG emissions intensity, of 0.9% and 10.6% respectively, despite a decrease in both energy and GHG emissions, of 14.9% and 6.8% respectively. This was due to a more than proportional decrease in\n\nmineral processed of 15.7%. For a detailed overview of initiatives to decrease our energy consumption and enhance our climate change resilience strategy, refer to the Climate change section in pages 111-128.\n\n## GHG-energy profile\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n2016\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCombustion from fossil fuels (own)\n\nCombustion from fossil fuels (contractors)\n\nElectricity from the National Grid\n\nElectricity from TEP (thermal)\n\nElectricity from MLP (wind)\n\nElectricity from EDC (wind)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJuanicipio\n\nSan Juli\u00e1n\n\nSaucito\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nHerradura\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFresnillo\n\nCi\u00e9nega\n\nCi\u00e9nega\n\nFresnillo\n\nHerradura\n\nSaucito % renewable\n\nSan Juli\u00e1n\n\nJuanicipio",

Reporting. These sources fall within our operational control. We do not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in our consolidated statement. The emissions and energy consumed in the United Kingdom and offshore as well as those pertaining to our exploration projects and corporate offices are negligible. We have used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition), and a 100-year time horizon Global Warming Potential (GWP) for Methane (CH 4 ) and Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) equivalences. Updates to Scope 1 and 2 data vs previous periods are twofold: the former due to rectifications of fuel inventories derived from the external audits - but not material as they amount to an increase of less than 1.5% of GHG emissions - and the latter due to the Mexican National Grid emission factor for the period - usually published on a later date than this annual report. For the same reason, the emission factor of electricity consumed from the Mexican Power Utility CFE during 2023, corresponds to 2022.\n\nScope 1: Direct GHG emissions/energy consumed.\n\nScope 2: Indirect GHG emissions/energy consumed from purchased electricity.\n\nMineral processed: Corresponds to the mineral processed in the beneficiation and leaching plants and the mineral deposited in the leaching pads.\n\n## Electricity supply\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOther sources\n\nWind energy",

Our response during 2023 was to pilot then implement an enhanced approach to energy load management and distribution. Guided by Lean Six Sigma principles, the initiative aimed to reduce demand by 1.7 MW versus the baseline.\n\nUsing a holistic strategy, the project mapped and involved a wide range of stakeholders across different roles, with particularly close collaboration between the operational and maintenance departments. Our team fine-tuned the timing of stoppages and start-ups of operational equipment, mitigating\n\ndemand spikes during the more expensive electricity rate periods while guaranteeing production targets. This process was overseen from the Mining Operations Centre (COM), which is also responsible for coordinating and supporting the movement of ore loads on the surface.\n\nOperators at the COM were given the critical task of optimising energy loads across pumping stations and production shafts, scheduling the usage of exploration drills and maintaining principal ventilation systems, subject to hourly industrial electricity rates set by the Mexican power utility, CFE. By meticulously calculating the impact of each process on energy demand, the team aimed to minimise operational\n\ndisruptions and manage energy use more efficiently during peak rate periods.\n\nFollowing its successful implementation, the project not only achieved an overall decrease of 4.8% in electricity demand, but also reduced the unit cost of electricity (average cost per kWh) by 6.5%. This delivered savings of over US$2.4 million compared to the period's original budget, and of 3.4% compared to 2022 energy costs. This successful implementation of demand control underscores our commitment to environmental stewardship by reducing our operational impact, as well as to operational efficiency by optimising energy use, contributing to a more sustainable and cost-effective business management.\n\n<!-- image -->",

This includes all four of the TCFD pillars and the 11 recommended disclosures set out in Figure 4 of Section C of the report entitled 'Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' published in 2021 by the TCFD. In completing this work, we made use of TCFD guidance material including the TCFD technical supplement on the use of scenario analysis, TCFD Guidance on Metrics, Targets and Transition Plans, and the TCFD Guidance for All Sectors. Our report is partially consistent with the TCFD recommendations as outlined in the table below, with Strategy-recommended\n\ndisclosures B and C, and Metrics and Targets recommended disclosure C still requiring further development. We are in the process of developing a roadmap to integrate adaptation measures into financial planning and maturing our approach to carbon pricing. We believe this will also allow us to mature the connections between climate change and other relevant environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks and incorporating them more explicitly into KPIs and targets. In 2024, we plan to continue our progress in reporting against all four pillars of the recommendations.\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Statement.

While we recognise there are significant opportunities to increase our revenue, for example through increased demand for our products - e.g. silver for solar photovoltaic (PV) - climate change poses risks to our business (both transition and physical) such as increased drought and heat reducing business productivity. We have progressed on our TCFD disclosures year-on-year. This year, we have evolved our disclosure to consider the potential financial impact of physical risks and carbon pricing mechanisms through quantitative scenario analysis. This has further informed our strategy regarding climate-related risks and opportunities to ensure we are resilient in the short, medium and long term.\n\n## Governance\n\n## Board\n\nOur governance structure is outlined below, with further details available in the Governance section. The Board oversees key risks and associated management strategies, while the Audit Committee evaluates the efficiency of risk management and internal controls. The Board has overall responsibility for the oversight of the climate change strategy and considers its impact on the business during decision-making regarding our strategy, risk management, investments and stakeholders. The Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee, assists the Board and collaborates with management to meticulously supervise the Company's strategies ensuring they effectively address ESG considerations, including climate change. The Board reviews this progress in quarterly meetings, during which the Chairman of the HSECR\n\nCommittee presents updates. Directors actively engage in inquiries and provide recommendations during these sessions to guide management. Furthermore, the Board also receives quarterly updates from the CEO on sustainability performance, including advancements in our climate change strategy. In 2023, the main climaterelated activities by the Board were:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the update provided to the Board by the HSECR Committee Chairman to the Board.\n- \u00b7 Review of the CEO's report on the Company's areas of opportunity according to a 2022 TCFD gap analysis.\n- \u00b7 Overview of ESG reporting, with a focus on climate change regulation and mining industry climate-target benchmarks (working session).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\nRelevant competencies of Board members for addressing climate change, particularly within the HSECR Committee, are detailed in the Board biographies on pages 194-197. Notably, Mr Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez contributes extensive expertise in Mexican public policy and possesses a strong academic background in macroeconomics; Ms Georgina Kessel, former Minister of Energy (2006-2011), offers significant experience in energy and climate change; Dame Judith Macgregor, with extensive diplomatic experience, provides valuable international perspectives on climate change and Mr Fernando Ruiz contributes considerable experience in Mexican taxation and insights into evolving carbon pricing legislation. Additional information about the HSECR and Audit committees' Terms of Reference and their specific contribution to climate strategy, can be found on the Company's corporate website.\n\n## The Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Committee\n\nThe HSECR committee actively engages with Management to provide oversight on the effectiveness of the Company's ESG strategies. This involves assessing management's handling of climaterelated risks and opportunities (CROs). Climate change is discussed at quarterly meetings, and the HSECR Chairman reports insights from these meetings to the Board. The HSECR Committee monitors the Company's progress against key targets and metrics at quarterly meetings through a dashboard produced by the ESG Compliance team with key inputs provided\n\nby the mining units. Discussions at these meetings include TCFD requirements, progress against renewables target, and intensity metrics on water, energy and GHG emissions.\n\nIn 2023, the main climate-related activities of the HSECR Committee were:\n\n- \u00b7 Calibration of KPIs for review at the beginning of each session and definition of benchmarking against peers.\n- \u00b7 Review of climate change KPIs trends.\n- \u00b7 Review of Company's TCFD reporting gaps and recommendations for full compliance with regulations.\n- \u00b7 Review of the TCFD 2023 programme to address a portion of the reporting gaps.\n\nIn previous years, briefings and capacity building have covered the basic principles of science-based targets, with a specific focus on the identifying, evaluating and prioritising CROs; a global perspective of TCFD reporting including benchmarks and gap analysis, has also been covered. During 2023, the committee was briefed on ESG rankings and ESG-criteria in credit ratings, TCFD's alignment with other   relevant methodologies (FTSE4Good index, S&P's CSA, CDP's climate change questionnaire, among others), and delved deeper into analysing specific gaps that may hinder the Company's full TCFD compliance, strategically prioritising issues slated for resolution. The objective is to ensure that the Directors possess the necessary skills and competencies to oversee Fresnillo's regulatory compliance and overall climate strategy.\n\n## Audit Committee\n\nThe Audit Committee continues to have an active role in climate-related management after updating its terms of reference in 2022 to include the review and approval of the statement on climate-related financial disclosures. Its role has continued to include:\n\n- \u00b7 Overseeing the TCFD disclosures and progress towards consistency with TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing principal and emerging risks on a quarterly basis and monitoring the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls.\n\nThis year, the Audit Committee also approved the preparation for a third-party external assurance of our KPIs related to Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions concurrent with the fiscal year reporting.\n\n## Management's role\n\nGuided by the Board and Executive Committee leadership, and in alignment with our risk appetite tailored on a caseby-case basis, we systematically seek to understand, prioritise, and address our risks through a robust risk management framework. Within the senior and middle management tiers, the responsibility for climate change encompasses identifying strategic risks, evaluating their impact on achieving strategic objectives, and ultimately supervising the implementation of controls in both strategic and operational plans.

The team explored the Fresnillo business model - its value creation mechanisms, operational control, influence across the value chain - identified risks and opportunities and laid the foundations for the comprehensive CROs assessment of that period. Fast forward to 2022, the finance team continued to deep dive into carbon pricing mechanisms and various approaches to assess their impacts in financial analysis.\n\nBuilding on this momentum, 2023 witnessed a new initiative with representatives from risk, financial control and ESG compliance, forming a new steering team. This group reassessed the CROs long-list, concluded the harmonisation of the climate-risk framework with the central enterprise risk framework (ERM), and commenced a collaboration with the mining units to refine, homogenize and assign sitespecific controls, key risk indicators (KRIs), mitigation strategies and risk owners for continuous monitoring moving forward.\n\nSimultaneously, workshops were conducted for senior management and middle management focusing on climate scenarios and financial risk quantification to bolster climate-capacity building at key positions within the organisation. Strategic meetings with financial planning and long-term mine planning aimed to define criteria and coordinate efforts for 2024, setting new priorities towards our climate financial analysis and maturity. Finally, in the environmental department's annual meeting, we engaged in a comprehensive discussion on the latest climate-reporting practices to continue building capacities among our workforce.\n\n## Strategy\n\nClimate risks, opportunities and strategic decision-making Climate change represents a principal risk for Fresnillo, and the CROs it poses have strategic implications for our business. The world's transition to a low-carbon future depends on mining in providing the essential minerals required for technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, electric vehicles and batteries. However, we must simultaneously decarbonise our operations to comply with increasing regulation supporting the global transition to a net-zero economy. Although Mexico, where our operations are based, does not currently have a net zero target, there is an increasingly robust regulatory framework aligned with the recently updated National Determined Contributions (NDC) of 30% reduction in economy-wide emissions by 2030, which necessitates heavy industry playing its part. Therefore, we must consider and prepare for risks such as carbon taxes, while using the opportunity to increase efficiency and incorporating renewables to reduce operational costs.\n\nIn 2021, we conducted a comprehensive review of our business model to identify CROs through the life cycle of mining. Our approach began with desktop research to establish a risk catalogue, drawing insights from industry benchmarks, by significant peers and climate change guidance documents, such as sectorspecific and cross-industry guidance from TCFD. We also held interviews with key representatives and workshops involving personnel that represented every aspect of the business - including finance, exploration, projects, operations, industrial safety and environment, and sustainability - engaging in conversations about how climate change may affect our operations; this group designated representatives from different areas to form an expert team from administrative and operational areas across the Company to participate in a scoping workshop to leverage existing progress on TCFD and climate risk management practices.\n\nThe team discussed the Fresnillo business model - its value creation mechanisms, operational control, influence across the value chain and the risks and opportunities of growth and innovation plans - its current processes, criteria and thresholds to identify risks and opportunities, and explored additional exposure sources and consequences of climate change, setting the foundations for a comprehensive view on the matter that provided the raw material for the CROs assessment, thus achieving an initial robust and comprehensive CRO register, comprising 100 elements. The outcome was a comprehensive CROs register with detailed information on each identified risk including its TCFD category, external root cause, value chain impact and value driver affected. A longlist of 55 individual CROs was retained for evaluation and prioritisation.\n\nIn 2023, we revisited the original longlist of CROs, such that instead of assessing them with preliminary modelling for prioritisation, as we did in 2021, we might keep the complete universe, incorporating more general aspects onto the definitions. This approach was informed with interviews held with risk owners, such as industrial safety and environment, TSFs, water, mine planning, and maintenance, and rectified during two comprehensive workshops with Senior management and middle management. This process allowed us to reach a comprehensive 25 element universe of CROs that later was subject to assessment for likelihood and impact, according to the enterprise risk management (ERM) framework. What we saw in the original exercise - and continue to see as we have rebalanced and updated this analysis - is that most CROs are related to the operational phase of the value chain (extraction and beneficiation), as compared to others (development and construction, closure and post-closure, others).",

While 2040 has been chosen to give a consistent long-term perspective of climate risk overall assessment for the business, some locations will cease operations before that. However, we have continued to include these locations in the assessment as the risk at these sites continues throughout the closure and post-closure stages of the mining life cycle.\n\nRisk/Opportunity  description and impact on business\n\n| Time horizon   | Description                 |\n|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Short-term     | Up to 5 years: 2024- 2028   |\n| Medium-term    | From 6-10 years:  2029-2034 |\n| Long-term      | Over 10 years: 2035+        |\n\nThe CROs list is Red-Amber-Green (RAG) rated based on the ERM framework scoring.

For evaluating physical risk, scenario data is sourced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), an intergovernmental body of the United Nations, dedicating to advancing scientific knowledge on climate change resulting from human activities. The IPCC scenarios are based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), which offer insights into possible social, economic, political and technological changes between the present and 2100.\n\nTransition risks are evaluated using scenarios provided by the International Energy Association (IEA). The IEA uses a\n\nscenario approach relying on the Global Energy and Climate (GEC) Model to examine future energy trends, and to explore a variety of scenarios with different underlying assumptions. Two of these scenarios have been employed to assess the drivers of potential outcomes and analyse associated potential risks. These are the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) which shows a narrow but achievable pathway for the global energy sector to achieve Net Zero by 2050, and the Announced Pledges Scenario (APS), which considers all climate commitments made by governments around the world, including NDCs and Net Zero targets.\n\nWhile scenario analysis is a hypothesised outcome rather than a forecast, our analysis enables us to understand the potential impact of climate change on our business under a selection of scenarios so we can plan accordingly, both operationally and\n\n## Climate scenarios description\n\n| Warming trajectory  by 2100   | Scenario                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Physical   scenario source   | Transition   scenario source   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| 1.5\u00b0C                         | Rapid transition to a global low carbon economy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Not considered IEA NZE       |                                |\n| <2\u00b0C                          | Steady transition to a global low carbon economy in line with the Paris   Agreement.

In previous years, we have conducted qualitative scenario analysis across our shortlist of climate change risks and opportunities. This year, we utilised quantitative scenario analysis to assess which physical risks our business is most exposed to, as well as how a carbon tax could impact our business financially. Only results for most material risks are included in the following analysis. Looking ahead, we envision employing similar scenario analysis techniques for all our climate risks, and to quantify our most significant opportunities, such as the increase in demand for metals and minerals in the global  transition  toward  Net  Zero    .",

Direct increase in overhead costs, from Scope 1 and 2 emissions (e.g. cost of electricity and fuel).\n- \u00b7 Increased cost of raw materials, under Scope 3, due to upstream suppliers passing on increased costs.\n- \u00b7 Reduction in sales due to potential consumer shifts if increased costs from carbon taxes are passed on to the consumer.\n\nScenario analysis was carried out under a Net Zero emissions pathway (1.5\u00b0C) scenario and an announced pledges (2-3\u00b0C) scenario. For our analysis, we used carbon prices provided by these scenarios (in the absence of current Mexican carbon prices), along with our GHG footprint by mine site and by emissions scope. Carbon prices used in the analysis were collated from the International Energy Agency (IEA) for both developing and developed economies. This is to represent the range of prices that may be introduced in Mexico in the future, and to also represent prices related to the introduction of the CBAM in the EU.\n\n## Key analysis\n\nUnder a Net Zero-aligned scenario, the potential financial impact of carbon taxes is US$127.7 million using developed economy carbon pricing, and US$82.1 million using developing economy pricing. This incorporates our current aim to reduce Scope 2 emissions by 75% by 2030 into the analysis. This risk is due to significant projected growth in carbon prices in both scenarios and in both types of economies modelled. Assuming constant emissions over the medium and long term, impacts continue to increase with rising carbon prices. This risk is reduced if we continue to reduce Scope 2 emissions beyond 2030 and formalise plans to reduce Scope 1 emissions.\n\nIndirect Scope 3 emissions account for the majority of our potential exposure to carbon costs, particularly upstream efforts to reduce emissions which may result in extra costs being passed on to us from our suppliers. We have limited ability to influence these costs as they will depend on the extent to which suppliers reflect carbon tax expenditure/mitigation expenditure within their prices. Regarding downstream passing on of costs, the ability for us to set and control prices is limited, and broadly controlled by global commodity prices and markets.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- \u00b7 A 75% reduction in Scope 2 emissions by 2030 has been assumed based on our target to have 75% of our energy coming from renewable sources by 2030. A 100% reduction in Scope 2 emissions by 2035 has also been assumed for the purposes of this analysis.\n- \u00b7 We expect our Scope 2 emissions reductions noted above to be cost neutral through the move towards renewable energy.\n- \u00b7 We have assumed that only 50% of the Scope 3 upstream emissions as pricing from suppliers is on an arm's length basis, therefore expect higher costs to suppliers to be passed on to us, although allows to reflect the costs from investing in new equipment as well.\n- \u00b7 We have assumed 0% of Scope 3 downstream emissions will be passed on to us and there is no room for negotiation in agreeing pricing with customers.\n\n## Key\n\n| Impact rating        | Financial impact range      | Colour   |\n|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------|\n| Insignificant        | $100,000 - $999,999         | Colour   |\n| Minor                | $1,000,000 - $9,999,999     | Colour   |\n| Medium               | $10,000,000 - $99,999,999   | Colour   |\n| Significant/Major    | $100,000,000 - $999,999,999 | Colour   |\n| Catastrophic/Extreme | > $1,000,000,000            | Colour   |\n\nNote: The impact rating is obtained though the quantification of the risk rating, based in likelihood.\n\nScenario analysis",

The risks are diverse and will affect sites differently, primarily dependent on whether mines are underground or open pit, and in which region of Mexico they are located. Primary physical risks across sites are increasing events of excess heat, increased frequency and severity of wildfires and the potential for increased precipitation resulting in tailings dam breaches. Insurance covers some physical risk impact but not necessarily all physical risks associated\n\n## Current vs future physical risks\n\nChange\n\nRisk\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwith climate change. Our analysis focused on the total assessed impact from asset damage, business disruption and productivity loss. This risk will be mitigated to an extent by insurance and current and planned mitigation activities outlined on pages 115-117.\n\nWe conducted scenario analysis on eight physical risk hazards (wildfire, heat, flood, precipitation, drought, hail/thunderstorms, cold and wind). This analysis utilised the scenarios created by the IPCC, and was conducted over five-year intervals from 2020 to 2100. There were three areas of\n\nfocus for our analysis: risk ratings; riskspecific metrics; and potential financial loss due to physical risks. Risk ratings for all eight hazards analysed allow us to compare the severity and frequency of these risks in the short term, with how these risks are modelled to change over time, specifically, over 2050. We use this information to identify sites exposed to physical risks in the nearer term, and also sites that may become exposed to risk in the future but may be currently at a much lower risk level, as explained in the figure below.",

Following,\n\nour insights into these results. For more information on emerging and principal risks, refer to the Managing our risks and opportunities section of this report in pages 151-183.\n\n## TCFD Category\n\nRisk/Opportunity\n\n## Potential Impact\n\n## Scenario analysis findings\n\nPhysical - Acute\n\nPhysical - Acute\n\nImpact of increased frequency and severity of wildfire on mine sites and infrastructure/equipment.\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue disruption from the interruption of supply of electricity due to wildfire damage in the area surrounding a mine site.\n\nImpact of increased frequency and severity of extreme heat events on mine sites and worker productivity.\n\n- \u00b7 Inefficiencies in production due to disrupted employee travel due to disruption to access routes caused by fires.\n- \u00b7 Increased facility and operational down time, due to damaged infrastructure and equipment with limited mobility.\n- \u00b7 Direct damage to critical inputs such as cyanide or plastic and rubber spare parts, which are more susceptible to wildfire than ore and mineral concentrates.\n- \u00b7 Reduction in the rate of revenue generation due to reduced productivity of our employees in instances of extreme high heat.\n- \u00b7 Increased reliance on cooling systems and increased potential for cooling system failure due to increased usage.\n- \u00b7 Increase in days exceeding 38\u00b0C at all sites.\n\n## Key analysis\n\nWildfire is one of the most material risks to Fresnillo, having a high impact on 75% of our operational sites. The highest risk sites are situated in the centre of Mexico, however, all of our sites are in the 'high' or 'very high' risk tiers in relation to wildfire, with small increases in risk between 2020 and 2050. Wildfire risk is likely to disrupt operations and damage site infrastructure and equipment. It also poses a safety hazard for our employees due to the risk from flames, excess heat and smoke.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- \u00b7 A wildfire event is assumed to cause complete site disruption, so that no work can be performed.\n- \u00b7 Damage/Disruption due to smoke and embers is not considered.\n- \u00b7 For the purposes of scenario analysis modelling, each wildfire is considered to be of the same intensity and strength.\n\n## Key analysis\n\nExtreme heat can impact a business through a decrease in worker productivity or by impacting the performance of machinery without sufficient cooling equipment. Days exceeding 38\u00b0C gives an indication of the number of days when business as usual operations could be disrupted due to extreme heat. For the high risk locations, there are expected to be 73-85 days exceeding 38\u00b0C per year under a 2-3\u00b0C scenario. Under a 4\u00b0C scenario, there are expected to be 77-86 days. The impact is likely to be felt most at sites which have not historically experienced this level of heat, as mitigation measures are less likely to be in place. However, our mitigating actions are outlined on pages 116 and 117. Sites which have historically experienced extreme temperatures may be more prepared, but are at risk of extended periods of extreme temperatures. Our open pit mines in the north-west region will likely be most vulnerable to heat risk.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- \u00b7 Productivity losses occur by a uniform percentage above a temperature of 35\u00b0C.\n- \u00b7 There is no distinction made between potential differences in productivity in accordance with genders, age or preexisting conditions.\n- \u00b7 It is not taken into consideration whether workers are acclimatised to temperatures exceeding the threshold used (35\u00b0C).\n- \u00b7 Absenteeism from health impacts of heat is not considered.",

Current risk ratings are rated on a scale from 'Lowest' risk to 'Highest' risk and are based on the severity of a given hazard in 2020 under a >4\u00b0C scenario. The risk change ratings reflect the change in risk from 2020 under a >4\u00b0C scenario to 2050 under the same scenario. These are on a scale from 'Lowest' risk change to 'Highest', with the additional rating option of 'Reduction in risk' (as the risk posed by a hazard can also decrease over time).

Strategic priorities include capitalising on the increased demand for silver in solar PV and optimising operational costs.\n\nClimate change affects various stages of the mining life cycle, including exploration, development, operation, closure and postclosure. A comprehensive understanding and strategic planning on climate-related risks will allow us to implement effective measures that will mitigate the impact of, and reduce our exposure to transitional risks. Adapting to climate change will safeguard the wellbeing of our workforce, fortify our mining infrastructure, secure water supplies, allow us to collaborate with\n\nsurrounding communities, and overall minimise the potential impact on our business. Therefore, our climate strategy goes beyond mere resilience; it embraces a proactive approach, aiming to both mitigate our impact on climate change and adapt to its physical consequences at the same time. In pursuit of this goal, we have initiated a transformative journey to enhance our practices and secure our longterm sustainability through two ongoing, impactful projects. While we are in the process of developing transition plans and strategies, we believe these two projects will enable us to anticipate and integrate associated costs and revenue streams with more accuracy. This will ensure that we align our financial strategies to deliver longterm profitability and resilience.\n\n| Project                       | Regional Climate Modelling                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Decarbonisation roadmap                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Background                    | Existing climate information for Mexico is   insufficient to assess impacts on mining  infrastructure, necessitating advanced, Company- tailored climate modelling to understand risk,  vulnerabilities and adaptation measures for each  stage of the mining cycle.

We are dedicated to sustainable operations and remain optimistic about our profitgeneration capacity. With strong processes to manage and adapt to climate-related risks, we are well-equipped to successfully navigate the changing climate landscape, securing the long-term sustainability and success of our business.\n\n## Priorities for 2024\n\nIn last year's report, we announced our intention to mature our approach to internal carbon pricing, and during 2023, internal discussion took place among different departments with a stake in financial and long-term planning. An agreed action item for 2024 is to standardise of the long-term energy planning forecast to enable its incorporation into different internal operational and strategic reports, thus providing sufficient elements to continue maturing our financial analysis. We also aim to pursue the refining of quantitative analysis to examine our climate-related opportunities in the future.\n\nLast year's report also described our interest in developing a roadmap to integrate mitigation and adaptation measures into our financial planning. For this purpose, we have embarked on two projects which will help us make informed decisions regarding our climate change initiatives. The regional climate modelling project was successfully concluded during 2023, providing industry-valuable insights that will continue to be further developed with the engineering teams throughout 2024. Additionally, an indepth analysis of our two largest assets was launched at the end of 2023 to better understand the available the low-carbon technologies for the Company and the objectives we may realistically commit to for the decarbonisation of our mining operations. We believe these studies will also provide insights into engaging the value chain for Scope 3 reductions moving forward. All these initial efforts are geared towards making progress on our path to developing a transition plan that aligns with the framework outlined by the Transition Pathway Taskforce (TPT) in the years ahead.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board has overall responsibility for our approach to risk management and delegates this responsibility to the Audit Committee. Climate change is considered a principal risk to the business, and we adopt a Group-wide approach to risk management see page 151-183 based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice. The principal risk of climate change connects with our emerging risks (see page 151-183), notably water stress and drought, transition to a low-carbon future and increasing societal and investor expectations.\n\n## Identifying and assessing climate risks and opportunities\n\nThe intricate and rapidly evolving nature of climate change amplifies various risks, including environmental incidents, access to water, workforce health and safety, government regulations, and social licence to operate.

Our approach began with desktop research to establish a risk catalogue, drawing insights from industry benchmarks, by significant peers and climate change guidance documents. We also held interviews with key representatives and workshops involving personnel that represented every aspect of the business, thus achieving a robust and comprehensive CRO register.\n\nIn 2023, we reassessed this register, enhancing the prioritisation of risks. The integration process involved aligning the scoring criteria from the Company's ERM into the climate risk framework. Simultaneously, we consolidated the longlist of CROs into a concise compilation of the most material risks and opportunities. This entailed redefining some of the risks to ensure the definitions were generalisable to our business, but not too site-specific. The result was a more focused list of top priority CROs, allowing us more clarity to plan mitigation actions around, as well as confirm our risk appetite regarding these material climate risks.\n\nIn the future, we look to use scenario analysis techniques to quantify our most prevalent opportunities, such as the increase in demand for metals and minerals in the world's transition to net zero.\n\n## Managing climate risks\n\nThe business-wide impacts of climate change led the Company to include climate change as one of the emerging risks, as part of Provision 28 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code; climate change is now a principal risk. Updates on the regulatory landscape are considered in line with business-wide regulatory monitoring processes. In this regard, climate change related risks have been included in the financial viability study, primarily hypothetical scenarios of winter storms and extreme rainfall.\n\nFor a more detailed overview of these scenarios, please see Viability statement on pages 120-125.\n\nThis year, our focus has been on fully integrating our assessment of climaterelated risks and opportunities with our ERM framework. As a result, we have updated our climate risk framework to reflect the same scoring system and timeframes as our central ERM framework, enabling ranking of climate alongside other risks to our business. We also used scenario analysis to determine the scale and magnitude of the physical and one transition risk, namely carbon tax. We used three physical and transition scenarios against medium- and long-term horizons. This analysis informed the identification of risks and opportunities as well as the corresponding mitigation measures and implications for our strategy.\n\nOur updated climate change risk management system is a collaborative effort involving operational and corporate departments such as mine operations, plant operations, maintenance, mine closure, environment, industrial safety, tailing storage facilities (TSFs), community relations, energy, financial planning, operational comptrollership, financial comptrollership, explorations comptrollership, legal, ESG and risk. Ongoing work focuses on the definition of risk owners, identifying current controls and mitigation actions, and collaboratively enhancing these through monitoring and management, across all operating units. Our purpose is to run this exercise periodically with risk owners to ensure accuracy of impact assessment and adequacy of mitigation actions moving forward.\n\nFurther work will be carried out in 2024 for the purpose of standardising and maturing controls and mitigation actions with their risk owners across our units, determining a baseline for each and planning ahead given our current analysis of our assets' vulnerabilities to physical risks.\n\n## Priorities for 2024\n\nDuring 2024 we will be assessing physical risks in the business units more frequently with the support of weather stations, and we plan to implement a training programme on climate change issues for all environmental and industrial safety areas.\n\nWe will also continue to monitor our climate-related risks and opportunities, calibrating the risk management framework at the mining unit basis for the top priority identified in the 2023 reassessment exercise. This activity will be followed by a second phase, which we expect to achieve the same level of detail for the entire list of CROs.\n\n## Metrics and targets\n\nOur target is to source 75% of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. We have steadily increased our consumption of renewables in recent years, despite regulatory uncertainties which have caused delays to new renewable supply sources coming online. Waiting periods for the modifications to our transmission permission agreements have increased and meant that we have been unable to move directly from our Wind-Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) to our Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM) available wind-sources. In 2022, this led to us having to consume more electricity from the Mexican power utility, Comisi\u00f3n Federal de Electricidad (CFE). The result was a temporary reduction in renewable consumption, offset in 2023. We are currently running studies to gain insight into further target setting across other climate ambitions, as explained in the Strategy section.\n\nOur primary climate-related metrics and targets are linked to our priority CROs, provided in Table on pages 115-119. Additionally the mining industry is energy and water intensive, and thus the rigorous monitoring of our usage of both resources is key to our operations. Our metrics are outlined on page 128. Further work is still needed to comply with the crossindustry metrics.",

The ore is reduced in sized by crushing and milling to obtain sand and silt-sized particles. The milled rock is then mixed with water and moved as a slurry for further processing to separate the valuable minerals from the milled rock. The remaining slurry of milled rock is known as tailings. Tailings are transported and stored in engineered structures known as Tailings Storage Facilities (TSFs) or combined with cement to be reused as paste backfilling in underground workings.\n\n## Waste rock\n\nMining operations remove waste rock to access the ore. Most mining waste is transported and deposited in waste piles for permanent storage, though some waste rock is used in underground cut and fill operations. Most of the Company's mineral waste is generated by the open pit operations and deposited in waste rock piles.\n\n## Heaps\n\nPart of the disseminated ore deposits at Herradura and Noche Buena are processed using heap leaching. Channels surrounding the heaps and contingency ponds are hydraulically designed to handle flood flows caused by extreme rainfall events. Conditions both up and downstream are proactively monitored to detect changes in water quality. Once extraction of ore from the mine is complete, the piles are rinsed and allowed to drain down to protect the environment.\n\nGovernance framework of TSFs\n\n## SITE MANAGEMENT\n\n## Roles\n\nMine Manger Regional Tailings Manager Engineer of Record (EoR) Responsibilities Operate TSFs in accordance with guidelines Provide technical expertise Manage change processes\n\n## TAILINGS MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP TEAM\n\n## Roles\n\nAccountable Executive (AE)* Corporate Tailings Specialist Corporate Tailings Manager\n\nResponsibilities Lead team and provide oversight Develop corporate governance and controls Administer external reviews and verifications\n\n## EXTERNAL REVIEWS\n\n## Roles\n\nIndependent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP)\n\nDam Safety Inspections (DSI) Dam Safety Reviews (DSR)\n\n## Responsibilities\n\nConfirm compliance with governance and best practice requirements\n\n## GROUP-LEVEL OVERSIGHT\n\n## Roles\n\nTSF Review Executive Committee Responsibilities\n\nProvide overall oversight Continuous review of operation, governance, inspection, review and audit reports\n\nSafe tailings management is paramount across the entire life cycle of our mining operations, encompassing design, construction, operation, closure and post-closure phases. Aligned with our commitment to achieve zero harm to people and the environment, we have embarked on a comprehensive journey to implement industry-leading best practices in the governance and operation of our tailings storage facilities (TSFs), yielding substantial results so far, as described below. There were no tailings-related failures at our operations in 2023.\n\n## Governance\n\nOur governance framework establishes the roles, responsibilities and accountability of the groups involved in the design, construction, operation, maintenance and surveillance of TSFs in accordance with the diagram below.

The key milestones of the year included the internal issuance of the Tailings Management System's Corporate Tailings Guidelines and the Tailings Policy and Commitments for Responsible Tailings Management, both of which are essential pillars for a safety culture in mineral waste management. In 2023, we formalised the appointment of one Engineer of Record (EoR), adding to the EoR formalised in the previous period and further demonstrating our commitment to industry standards.

This allows us to efficiently oversee and evaluate progress while prioritising the most salient issues. Additionally, we have also successfully applied the initial audit tool to assess compliance with our tailings management system, demonstrating an improved performance compared to 2022. This exercise has provided valuable insights to enhance and strengthen our practices moving forward. We also successfully concluded ITRP reviews of the sites scheduled for the year; one point of note is the reduction in the issuance of priority recommendations by 66% compared to 2022, reinforcing the integrity of our operations and our commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nDuring the period, Operation, Maintenance, and Surveillance (OMS) Manuals as well as Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans (EPRPs) were issued by all mining units and integrated into current procedures and existing plans, strengthening our ability to respond effectively to any situation.

During the year, our strategic investments focused on the growth of our existing TSFs, as well as the development of new facilities to ensure operational continuity. A total of seven projects were executed with an overall investment of US$70 million. Among the most outstanding projects were the following:\n\n- \u00b7 Growth of San Juli\u00e1n's TSF.\n- \u00b7 Construction of Saucito's cell number 4.\n- \u00b7 Third phase of San Carlos' TSF at Fresnillo.\n\nOur approach to technology takes into consideration its strategic priority and maturity, and evaluates the contribution that it can make to:\n\nthe earliest opportunity. This proactive approach demonstrates our compliance and commitment to industry standards, but also reinforces our internal capacity for leadership in tailings management.\n\n## Risk management\n\nContinual evaluation is integral to upholding safety and environmental standards across the life cycle of TSFs. Adhering to best practices outlined by organisations such as the Mining Association of Canada (MAC), the Canadian Dam Association (CDA), the International Commission of Large Dams (ICOLD) and the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM), our design, construction, surveillance and maintenance follow industry guidelines with support from\n\nqualified engineering firms. Mine managers, guided by our protocols, operate facilities with a blend of shared services and internal resources. They are backed by a Regional Tailings Manager and an EoR through established Master Services Agreements with recognised consultancies. The Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP) and Dam Safety Inspections/Reviews (DSIs/DSRs) ensure compliance through renowned specialists and qualified consultants engaged by our tailings management and stewardship team. Routine surveillance, enhanced by advanced instrumentation and monitoring equipment enhance near real-time management of critical controls, condition reporting and response times, aligning with MAC guidelines.\n\n## Surveillance, maintenance and external reviews\n\n- \u00b7 Routine surveillance.\n- \u00b7 Intrumentation and monitoring.\n- \u00b7 OMS manuals development.\n- \u00b7 Independent experts, inspectors and auditors.\n- Improve safety: Surveillance, monitoring and alerting technology (i.e. inSar, drones, data analytics, etc.);\n\ni)\n\n- ii) Improve operational efficiency: Downstream processing technology (i.e. paste tailings and filtered tailings); and\n- iii) Reduce environmental risks and footprint: Upstream processing technology (i.e. selective processing, water and energy reduction, etc.).\n\nTechnological improvements have been implemented in the instrumentation and monitoring systems at the tailings deposits of San Juli\u00e1n and Herradura, with ongoing efforts continuing at Ci\u00e9nega and Juanicipio. These enhancements include robotic stations for the automatic measurement of prisms and topographic controls on the main geotechnical structures of the deposits. In addition, they involve the remote, continuous and automatic measurement of vibrating-wire piezometers, contributing to the confidence and timeliness of the data collected.\n\nIn the analysis of alternatives for the necessary infrastructure for tailings management in our current and future",

This involves exploring different technologies for the filtration and drying of tailings. Currently, these technologies have not been implemented due to their lack of technical and economic feasibility with our current operations.\n\nIt is important to note the alternative use of tailings in some of our operations. In Fresnillo, the Pyrites plant further reprocesses some tailings with economical value. In line with their management plans, Fresnillo and San Juli\u00e1n are authorised to use tailings as mine fill. Saucito is authorised to use tailings as a complementary construction material for TSF embankments and buttresses.

Beginning in 2020, we carried out a comprehensive process grounded in studies and\n\nresearch to validate the stability of the deposit. This phase of the project was followed by the establishment of a rigorous quality control and assurance system to guide the construction of the facility's subsequent phases. These efforts culminated in 2023, with the formalisation of the Engineer of Record (EoR) supported by a robust governance framework that ensures that the operation, maintenance and monitoring of the TSF follows international best practices.\n\nIn the early part of 2023, TSF Number 3 at Ci\u00e9nega marked a significant milestone by meeting the stability safety factors defined by the Canadian Dam Association (CDA). To achieve this, we conducted field research on the original structure, which informed the design and construction of strategic reinforcements to the main embankment. Today, this facility is prepared for any potential expansion to accommodate the mine's remaining operational lifespan, ensuring high safety standards aligned with the best in our industry.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCompany is actively working to extend these practices to all units, seeking the necessary approvals through applicable legal instruments. This not only adds value to mining waste but also reduces the quantity of waste deposited in situ, contributing to our ongoing efforts in waste management and environmental stewardship.\n\nDuring 2023, we continued to strengthen our global presence and positive influence in TSF management. For example, we actively participated in various national and international forums in Mexico, Peru, Chile, Canada and the United States. We presented technical papers, allowing us to highlight the relevance and importance of the work we have done and the challenges we have faced during the course of implementing our strategy, and positioning Fresnillo as a benchmark in the\n\nutilisation of advanced technologies and innovative strategies in mining waste and water management.\n\nRegarding the Global Industry Standard on Tailing Management (GISTM), we recognise its importance and relevance, having closely followed its development and progress. Although we do not currently intend to implement it, we understand the value and significance it brings to our industry and are committed to reviewing and assessing the impact of its potential implementation. As we previously explained in this section, we are working to develop and implement our Tailings Management System based on MAC's management protocol and we believe that achieving this milestone will enable us to meet many of the requirements outlined in the GISTM.",

According to national regulation, we dispose of these two different categories as shown in the diagram below.\n\nMining operations require the use of engine oils, fuels and chemical compounds as well as the management of tailings that may contaminate the soil if accidentally spilled. Soil can also be polluted by air-blown dust from tailings storage facilities (TSFs). Our management system has procedures in place to prevent soil contamination.\n\nNon-mineral waste disposal by category\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * CRETIB: For its acronym in Spanish, means corrosive reactive, explosive, environmentally toxic, flammable and biologically infectious.\n\nAll final destinations are regulated, either authorised or certified by the competent authority.\n\n## Non-hazardous waste\n\nMost of the non-hazardous waste generated by our mining operations involves recyclable materials such as cardboard, tyres, wood, steel and plastics, or urban solids. We place a strong emphasis on materials management, adhering to rigorous protocols for the proper handling of various non-hazardous waste streams.\n\nWithin various business units, dedicated sites are established for the storage of nonmineral waste. Waste that requires special handling as per regulations, including organic waste, is gathered and transported to a dedicated warehouse for meticulous segregation by trained operators. Here, we ensure the segregation of municipal solid waste from special waste (recyclables). Once classified, it undergoes reprocessing by accredited companies, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards.\n\nSpecial waste is sent to facilities accredited by authorities for recycling and reuse, thereby extending the lifespan of waste generated by our business units. Urban solid waste undergoes a compaction process and is directed to sanitary landfills or approved disposal sites. In certain mining operations, organic waste is given a second life through composting or utilisation by nearby communities, further underscoring our dedication to environmentallyconscious waste management practices across our operations.\n\n## Hazardous waste\n\nWe are fully committed and aware of our responsibility in the handling of hazardous waste. As part of our awareness strategies, comprehensive training sessions are conducted for all personnel on proper waste management. These sessions emphasise the benefits of effective waste management, leading to a reduction in\n\nwaste generation. The training covers the entire life cycle of waste for all personnel in the mining units. Additionally, preventive maintenance tasks are undertaken to ensure the efficient operation of equipment, minimising the risk of oil spills.\n\nHazardous waste is carefully stored, identified and organised before being dispatched for final disposal by authorised companies. Additionally, spent lubricating oil is sent for reprocessing to facilitate its reuse, aligning with our commitment to sustainable waste management practices.",

Uncontrolled AMD represents a risk to surface and groundwater resources during mine operation as well as a legacy issue after closure. We analyse minerals and conduct geochemical tests to identify the AMD potential of ore mineral and waste rock. In our operations with AMD risk, notably the San Ram\u00f3n satellite mine, we implement site-specific management strategies such as capping waste rock piles with a dry cover (to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water) and collecting and treating acid water.\n\n## Responsible cyanide management is\n\ncritical for environmental protection and safety. We comply with international best practices as promoted by the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI) and the Mexican standard NOM-155 SEMARNAT-2007, which establish environmental requirements for gold and silver leaching systems (production, transportation, storage, usage and facilities decommissioning). As part of our commitment to safe cyanide management, we engage with local authorities and collaborate with fire departments and hospitals to build emergency response capabilities. We also provide comprehensive training to our personnel and make operational and environmental information available to our stakeholders, ensuring both open dialogue and trust, which strengthen our social licence.\n\nWe design and operate our gold producing mines in compliance with the International Cyanide Management Institute (ICMI):\n\n- \u00b7 Purchase sodium cyanide from certified manufacturers.\n- \u00b7 Protect the environment and communities during transport to our facilities.\n- \u00b7 Protect our people and the environment during handling and storage.\n- \u00b7 Follow working practices that prevent impacts on health or ecosystems.\n- \u00b7 Optimise mineral processing to minimise the residual cyanide in tailings.\n- \u00b7 Manage and monitor seepage to prevent impacts on groundwater.\n- \u00b7 Decommission facilities responsibly to prevent legacy issues.\n- \u00b7 Provide our people with emergency response training, and on how to engage authorities and communities.\n\n## Performance\n\n## Waste disposal\n\n|                         | Unit   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total non-mineral waste | Tonne  | 13,201 | 13,148 |\n| Hazardous waste         | Tonne  | 3,206  | 1,870  |\n| Non-hazardous waste     | Tonne  | 9,994  | 11,279 |\n| Municipal solid waste   | Tonne  | 2,786  | 2,337  |\n| Special handling waste  | Tonne  | 7,209  | 8,941  |\n\nNote: New indicator so historic figures not available.\n\n## Sodium cyanide (NaCN) consumption (tonnes)\n\n| 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| 13,503 | 13,400 | 13,549 | 14,692 | 11,632 |\n\n## Packaging and storage\n\n## Collection and storage\n\n## Final disposal\n\n- \u00b7 An authorised provider collects and transports hazardous waste to an authorised storage facility.

        "page_content": "## Performance\n\nIn 2023, we established a dedicated corporate water management team charged with supporting the implementation of sustainable water management. This marked a pivotal step towards reinforcing our commitment to responsible water stewardship. Our new, specialised team is entrusted with overseeing the effective management of each of the four critical pillars and plays a central role in providing technical expertise and guidance to operational teams on crucial aspects such as hydrogeology, hydrology, developing water management plans, and the review and assurance of water balances and quality.\n\nOver the last 12 months, tangible progress has been achieved, with the implementation of water management initiatives at various projects, gathering vital information which has enabled us to develop comprehensive water management and availability plans at our mining units and advanced exploration projects. Notably, we carried out key baseline studies encompassing hydrology, hydrogeology, water balance and water supply assessment at Orisyvo. In the Fresnillo district, we continue to increase our wastewater treatment capacity to reduce freshwater consumption for our operations. In 2023, we signed an agreement with the municipal government to rehabilitate and operate a potabilisation water facility that will increase potable water for Fresnillo city inhabitants, as well as the availability of treated wastewater for our operations. See the case study on page 136 for more detail.\n\nDuring the year, we achieved a 7.19% decrease in our water consumption. A 15.63% decrease in our mineral processed resulted in a 10.01% increase in our overall water intensity. On a more positive note, we also achieved a 14.46% decrease in our water withdrawal and a 3.24% increase in our reuse efficiency, which rose to 84.95%. We did not detect any negative downstream impact on ecosystems or waterbodies due to our groundwater intake or water discharges.\n\nLooking ahead, in 2024 we will focus on further developing standards and procedures for water management within our operations. This strategic move is geared towards continuous improvement, ensuring that our water management practices not only meet but exceed industry standards, solidifying our commitment to sustainable and responsible resource usage.\n\n## Water management in megalitres*\n\n| Category               | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Total water withdrawn  | 28,399 | 32,180 | 30,707 | 21,138 | 20,941 |\n| Total water deviations | 13,631 | 17,207 | 13,954 | 7,522  | 7,721  |\n| Total water consumed   | 14,768 | 14,973 | 16,753 | 13,616 | 13,220 |\n\n- * 1 megalitre = 1,000 m 3\n\n## Statement of water inputs and outputs in megalitres\n\nFor the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\n| Category                        | Element             | Sub-element                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Input                           | Surface water       | Rivers and creeks                | 540    | 617    |\n|                                 | Groundwater         | Mine water                       | 2,270  | 5,154  |\n|                                 |                     | Bore fields                      | 7,959  | 6,721  |\n|                                 |                     | Ore entrainment                  | 542    | 353    |\n|                                 | Third party         | Waste water                      | 3,417  | 2,094  |\n| 14,728                          | 14,939              | Total water inputs               |        |        |\n| Output Surface water Discharges | Other               | Water entrained in  concentrates | 36  40 | 28  35 |\n| Total water outputs             | Total water outputs | Total water outputs              | 75     | 63     |\n\n## Water deviations in megalitres\n\nFor the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\n| Category   | Element       | Sub-element                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Input      | Surface water | Rivers and creeks                       | 0      | 0      |\n|            | Groundwater   | Aquifer interception  (dewatering)      | 13,595 | 17,179 |\n|            |               | Total water inputs                      | 13,595 | 17,179 |\n| Output     | Surface water | Discharges                              | 13,394 | 17,051 |\n|            |               | Supply to third party  (donation)       | 202    | 128    |\n|            |               | Loss (evaporation, infiltration,  etc.) | 0      | 0      |\n|            |               | Total water outputs                     | 13,595 | 17,179 |\n\n## Statement of operational efficiency in megalitres\n\nEfficiency for the period 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023.\n\n|                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total volume to tasks          | 71,653 | 77,135 |\n| Total volume of reused water   | 60,803 | 63,025 |\n| Efficiency of reuse            | 84.86% | 81.71% |\n| Total volume of recycled water | 3,806  | 2,401  |\n\n- *  To enhance transparency, we followed the International Council of Mining and Metals (ICMM) water reporting guidance and the Mineral Council of Australia's Water Accounting Framework.\n\n|                                 | Unit      | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|---------------------------------|-----------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Reuse efficiency                | %         | 84.86% | 81.71% | 78.98% | 81.66% | 79.89% |\n| Total volume of  recycled water | Megalitre | 3,806  | 2,401  | 1,955  | 1,716  | 982    |",

Recognising our responsibility as a corporate citizen, we have embarked on a multifaceted strategy to tackle water stress head-on through a series of initiatives, including the deployment of wastewater, purification and water potabilisation treatment plants.\n\nOur journey began in 2009 when we first began using municipal wastewater from Fresnillo city for our industrial processes, considerably reducing mine dewatering consumption. During 2023, we took an important next step by signing an agreement with the Potable Water, Sewage and Sanitation System of the Municipality of Fresnillo to rehabilitate and operate the city's potabilisation\n\nplant, which has a capacity to treat 150 litres per second (lps). This plant will treat Fresnillo's mine dewatering water: half of the treated water will be allocated to the residents of Fresnillo city for consumption, with the remaining rejected water from the potabilisation process being used in our industrial processes.\n\nThis strategic development underlines our commitment to working with local government to support the wellbeing of our neighbouring communities - and it bears testament to the long-term sustainability of our operations.\n\nThe results are expected to be significant and wide-ranging. Firstly, we are helping to ensure that communities facing water shortages receive the clean water they urgently need. At the same time, we are addressing the larger issue of water\n\n## Water consumption (megalitres)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Water intensity (m 3 /tonne of mineral processed)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nscarcity in the region by cutting down on our use of underground water. Secondly, the project will cut our operational expenses because treating municipal wastewater is over six times more cost-effective than using underground water from mine dewatering. Finally, by increasing the use of municipal wastewater in our processes, we are reducing our vulnerability to water stress and bolstering our operational resilience.\n\nOur water treatment facilities are available to visitors and we also offer educational tours. On average, we welcome 3,500 students from our school district each year, sharing information on our environmental culture and, in particular, on water stewardship.\n\n## General flow diagram for water management in the Fresnillo district\n\n<!-- image -->",

Notably, we deliberately avoid Mexican Natural Protected Areas, UNESCO Natural World Heritage sites, UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Reserves, and Ramsar Wetlands of International Importance as well as International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Protected Areas.\n\nAnchored in the Mexican biodiversity norm NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010, our Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and management plans serve as a robust framework, enabling us to responsibly manage biodiversity by identifying avoidance, mitigation and compensation measures. Before starting any project, and whenever significant events prompt a review - such as changes to permits or project expansion - we conduct comprehensive assessments to gauge our potential impact on biodiversity.\n\nWe identify species of special concern, capturing and releasing wildlife, relocating plant species, mapping, and providing periodic follow-ups, aligning with IUCN and Mexican biodiversity norm listings and species under protection status. Through collaborative efforts with state governments, we play an active role in safeguarding endemic endangered\n\nspecies. In particular, we contribute to the protection of the Sonoran pronghorn near Penmont and the golden eagle in the Fresnillo district. Moving forward, we are diligently working towards fulfilling the requirements to extend this protection to species such as the white-tailed deer and wild turkey in San Juli\u00e1n.\n\nWithin several of our mining sites, we have established Wildlife Conservation Management Units. These dedicated facilities aim to conserve natural habitats, wildlife populations and individual species. Their registry and management plans are approved by the Mexican Federal Environmental Agency, SEMARNAT. The unit at Fresnillo opens its doors to the public while those at both Fresnillo and Ci\u00e9nega feature educational tours designed to engage and educate children on the critical importance of environmental preservation.\n\n## Conservation programmes\n\n| Mining unit   | Programme                        |   Started operations | Species of interest                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|---------------|----------------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Fresnillo     | UMA                              |                 2001 | Buteo Jaimaicensis, Parabuteo Unicinctus, Polyborus Plancus, Ovis  musimon, Bubalus Bubalis, Bubo Virginianus, Canis Latrans, Linx rufus,  Panthera Onca, Procyon Lotor, Ateles Geoffroyi, Ursus Americanus, Pecari  tajacu, Crotalus atrox, Taxidea taxus, Gopherus agassizii, Podocnemis  lewyana, Pituophis Deppei Jani, Spilogale acilis, Panthera tigris tigris, Iguana  iguana, Buteo Swaisoni, Panthera Leo, Urocyon cinereoargenteus, Puma  concolor, Python mulurus, Aquila chrysaetos, Ara militaris, Sulcata, Tyto Alba |\n| Penmont       | Agreement with  local government |                 2008 | Sonoran pronghorn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Ci\u00e9nega       | UMA - Cebollitas                 |                 2015 | Odocoileus viginianus couesi                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Ci\u00e9nega       | UMA - Ci\u00e9nega                    |                 2017 | Picea Chihuahuana                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| San Juli\u00e1n    | UMA                              |                 2022 | Pseudosuga menziesii glauca                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\nWe also carry out meticulous soil conservation work and plant material cordons for erosion control, contributing to an increase in humidity levels, which in turn reinforces natural rehabilitation of habitats.

Fresnillo collaborates closely with external stakeholders to ensure aspirations for a post-mining community are integrated into the closure plan through regular consultation. Social transition initiatives, including workforce training, local procurement, infrastructure transfer and ongoing monitoring, are integral components of our strategy. For a detailed overview of how we engage with communities throughout the life cycle of mining, refer to the Partnering with our communities section in pages 139-140.\n\nNoche Buena is the first mine in the current portfolio that is planned for closure. Today, while it has stopped its pit operations, Noche Buena is continuing inventory recovery while it is economically feasible. Its progressive closure plan entails restoring land to its original premining use, particularly for livestock and wildlife purposes. Guided by principles of restoration and long-term maintenance, our objectives encompass a 20-year post-closure period. This means removing most access roads, power corridors, water supply and other infrastructure, while retaining certain facilities until post-closure care obligations are fulfilled. All waste management facilities, processing areas and other structures will be closed to ensure the safety of livestock and wildlife. Demolition waste and debris will be responsibly removed off-site, while certain facilities, such as the leach yard, may require ongoing care.\n\nNoche Buena's progressive closure plan is structured around three distinct phases of infrastructure: pits and waste rock heaps; industrial area; and leaching pads. Throughout 2023, various activities were initiated and will continue into 2024. These include ongoing mining works, geochemical characterisation, ecohydrological studies and comprehensive assessments of leaching pads, waste rock heaps and industrial areas. Further activities include dismantling and decommissioning processes, regulatory compliance reviews, and efforts related to reforestation, safety, environmental protection and social action plans.\n\n## Noche Buena's progressive closure plan stages\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## What's next\n\n- \u00b7 Continue maturing our climate change strategy.\n- \u00b7 During 2024 we will focus on further developing standards and procedures for water management within our operations.\n- \u00b7 Progressively implement critical environmental risk management methodology guided by the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) in our mining units.\n- \u00b7 Continue to deploy Noche Buena's progressive closure plan.",

Our community strategy, which spans all phases of the mining life cycle, aims to build mutual understanding between our operations and local communities, ensuring that we engage, develop and grow together.\n\n## Engaging communities effectively in the life cycle of mining\n\nIn the global mining industry, stakeholders are placing a growing emphasis on social and environmental responsibility, along with enhanced corporate governance: there is an increasing expectation for responsible management of negative impacts, coupled with a desire for tangible contributions to community development. Therefore, we firmly believe in the responsible, timely and transparent management of these expectations. This approach aims to reduce opposition to projects and strives to avoid or mitigate negative impacts on the communities where we operate.\n\nOur community engagement strategy is seamlessly integrated into every phase of the mining life cycle, fostering mutual understanding between our operations and local communities.\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures that we not only engage, develop and grow together but also emphasises our commitment to address stakeholder concerns and expectations throughout the mining life cycle. Our projects are therefore carefully designed to avoid adverse impacts. Should challenges arise, we proactively employ mitigation measures, addressing community concerns responsibly. This overarching strategy is supported by a multifaceted approach:\n\n- \u00b7 Monitoring public opinion to collaboratively identify industry challenges through partnerships with peers and business associations.\n- \u00b7 Conducting social studies to gain insights into the community's perceptions of our Company's performance, guiding our engagement strategies.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with communities through both formal and informal settings and ongoing social programmes to consolidate meaningful relations.\n- \u00b7 Utilising a grievance mechanism to swiftly address concerns, mitigate potential escalation and foster proactive resolution processes.\n- \u00b7 Aligning mitigation strategies with best practices in social and environmental responsibility.\n\nWe have procedures in place to detect potential risks, and conduct a thorough and strategic assessment, prioritising risks based on potential impact and location. Preventive and mitigation actions are established and overseen by dedicated monitoring committees for each risk, ensuring ongoing supervision. Strategic leaders in our mining units are kept informed, and mitigation strategies are collaboratively planned. Clear responsibilities are assigned to specialists, operating within an accountability framework for effective resolution. This process persists until the underlying conditions contributing to the risk are thoroughly addressed and resolved, resulting in the complete elimination of the risk.\n\nSituations that may heighten potential risks include the negative perception of the Company's performance, failure to address community concerns, reduction in public spending, increased expectations and scrutiny, ineffective engagement and communication, competition for natural resources and anti-mining activism, among others.\n\nOur exploration teams are the first to establish contact with a local community.

We consider our community investment to be an indirect economic impact of our activities and therefore present it separately from the Economic Value Distributed measure.\n\n|                                     | 2023 US$ million   | 2022  US$ million   | % change   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|------------|\n| Wages and benefits to workers       | 151.7              | 146.6               | 3.5        |\n| Payments to suppliers (contractors) | 1,983.2            | 1,817.3             | 9.1        |\n| Payments to local governments       | 12.6               | 6.2                 | 104.9      |\n| Payments to federal government      | 200.2              | 258.6               | (22.6)     |\n| Total economic impact               | 2,347.8            | 2,228.7             | 5.3        |\n\n## Economic value distributed by concept\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments to suppliers (contractors)\n\n84%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPayments to federal government\n\n9%\n\nWages and benefits to\n\nworkers\n\n6%\n\n- Payments to local governments\n\n1%\n\nEconomic value distributed is considered to be a social performance measure.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Economic value distributed by state\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMexico City\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSonora\n\nZacatecas\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nChihuahua\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDurango\n\nCoahuila\n\nGuanajuato\n\nOther\n\n3.0%\n\n## Mining fund\n\nIn 2014, Mexico introduced a special tax to create a fund for the sustainable development of mining regions. This fund was intended to support communities close to mining operations. However, Congress has reallocated the Mining Fund to national public spending. We partner with the communities where we operate to engage the authorities and aim to encourage them to fund infrastructure projects that benefit mining communities.\n\nThe Fresnillo plc contribution to the Fund for Sustainable Development of Mining States and Municipalities was US$33.15 million in 2023.\n\n|   2023 US$ million |   2022 US$ million |\n|--------------------|--------------------|\n|              33.15 |              48.66 |\n\n- *  Current mining fund taxes are used in our sustainability review as a social performance measure.\n\n## Local employment and procurement\n\nLocal employment is a key driver of social acceptability and community development. We promote local employment from the early days of the exploration phase onwards. In the development and operational phases, for example, we offer employment opportunities directly or through our mining contractors. Our local and regional labour as a percentage of the total workforce is 73.74%.\n\nWe participate in the mining clusters of Zacatecas, Sonora and Chihuahua. These clusters contribute to the development of regional suppliers, strengthening their participation in the value chain of mining companies. Additionally, our Centre for Technical Studies (CETEF) and Pe\u00f1oles Centre for Technical Studies in Laguna del Rey (CETLAR) train mining, instrumentation and maintenance technicians to meet our specific needs. Candidates are chosen from the communities surrounding our operations, thus securing talent and engaging the community in the long term.\n\n## Local employment\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|   2023 | 73.74%   |\n|--------|----------|\n|   2022 | 67.25%   |\n|   2021 | 70.98%   |\n|   2020 | 72.29%   |\n|   2019 | 68.41%   |\n\n24.8% 22.0% 19.3% 10.2% 8.2% 6.6% 6.0%",

We earn and maintain their trust through strong, accountable partnerships.\n\nAligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, we continuously strive to build a robust portfolio of social investments by collaborating with our communities. Our 'Alliance for the Common Good' strategy adopts a proactive approach, establishing transparent and participatory dialogues with all levels of government where we\n\noperate. By providing accurate, verifiable and pertinent information, we aim to influence decision-making in favour of our communities. We achieve this by presenting projects that directly address their most pressing concerns, leveraging funding opportunities across different government tiers. This ensures that public policy decisions within their jurisdiction enhance the state's presence in the region, but most importantly, contribute to the overall wellbeing of the community.\n\nOur overarching goal is to fortify the long-term capabilities of neighbouring communities and cultivate enduring relationships with them, civil society organisations and all three government levels. These tripartite partnerships play a crucial role in preventing adverse\n\nconditions caused by external entities, ensuring our operational continuity from both a regulatory and public investment perspective, and facilitate the acknowledgment and promotion of our contributions to society by authorities. We firmly believe that only through collaborative efforts can we achieve a more significant and lasting impact.\n\nFor a detailed overview of our social investment performance, refer to the end of this section on page 149; for an overview of our payments to local and federal governments, refer to our economic impact indicators on page 142; finally, for a more thorough review of our government payment transparency policy, refer to our Responsible business section on pages 86-87.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We firmly believe that nurturing quality education increases learning and development opportunities for children and young people within our communities. This commitment is crucial given the evolving landscape of the Mexican education system, existing educational disparities and the lingering impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. The results of the PISA test in Mexico have underscored concerning indicators that mirror the social reality of the nation's schools. The return to classrooms has enabled us to reactivate our educational initiatives since 2022, primarily focused on strengthening three foundational pillars: Reading, Mathematics and Science.\n\n## Key activities:\n\n- \u00b7 The 'Picando Letras' programme, which is jointly operated alongside our strategic partner Ensamble Alejandr\u00eda, was reactivated in-person at the Penmont, Ci\u00e9nega, Juanicipio, Saucito, Fresnillo, San Juli\u00e1n units and Guanajuato project (see case study).\n- \u00b7 The 'Tools for Peace Building' workshop was conducted to promote human rights, non-discrimination and the role of educators and students as peacebuilders at Penmont, in response to security concerns in the region.\n- \u00b7 In alignment with our commitment to advancing STEM education in schools, we continue to sponsor teams in the FIRST Robotics competition. Notably, in the 2023-2024 season, the recently formed team from the Mineral de La Luz community in Guanajuato clinched the Rookie Team of the Year award at the Laguna Championship and earned a spot at the World Championship in Houston, Texas, where they also earned another recognition - the Inspiration Award (see case study). Additionally, a new team from the Orisyvo project joined this season, bringing the number of sponsored teams to six.\n- \u00b7 In order to raise awareness among elementary and secondary school students about the causes and mitigation of climate change, we signed an agreement with the Cozcyt of the Government of Zacatecas to deliver the 'Latinamerica for Climate Education' course through our partner INNOVEC in the Fresnillo district.\n- \u00b7 For the fourth consecutive year, we collaborated with Larousse Editorial to donate books focused on subjects that enhance the understanding of school topics for children and young people.\n- \u00b7 We champion quality education through the Excellence Scholarship Programme in collaboration with Universidad La Salle campuses Laguna and Noroeste. During this academic year, we welcomed ten students from communities in San Juli\u00e1n, Guanajuato, Fresnillo, Ci\u00e9nega\n- and Penmont. Two students from the second generation graduated in 2023, in Marketing and Mechatronics, following the first four in 2022.\n- \u00b7 In line with our drive to foster artistic education as a creative alternative for children and young people, we supported the establishment of the Children's Rondalla in the Presa de Linares community in Juanicipio and continue to support the Juan \u00c1lvarez Rondalla in Penmont.\n- \u00b7 To support our commitment to encourage environmental responsibility and advocate for healthy nutrition among students, we have continued to promote School and Family Gardens in schools across communities within the Fresnillo district. This initiative is carried out with the valuable assistance of the Education Brigade for Rural Development No. 46 and our dedicated internal personnel.\n- \u00b7 In partnership with Sonora's Secretary of Education and Culture and fellow mining companies in the Sonora Mining Cluster, we spearheaded initiatives to benefit school communities. These initiatives include the 'Reactivate your school', 'We are', and 'Smart with your school' programmes. Furthermore, we created a hybrid virtual-in person model for implementation in institutions such as UTHermosillo, UNISIERRA and CONALEP.\n\n## Case study\n\n## Revitalising communities through creative and playful reading\n\nAs the challenges presented by the pandemic receded, 2023 marked a significant turning point for community engagement and social interaction. In collaboration with Alejandr\u00eda Ensemble, we were delighted to relaunch our widely respected 'Picando Letras' programme across all our mining units and at the Guanajuato advanced exploration project.\n\nDesigned around the concept of playful and creative reading, Picando Letras' fosters engaging spaces for community interaction and aims to narrow the educational gap caused by the pandemic-induced inactivity, which affected students and educators alike.\n\n'Picando Letras' empowers children and young people to see themselves as independent and critical readers, awakening them to the transformative potential of literature. However, the programme is not just about reading -\n\nit brings together entire families, building participatory and inclusive communities.\n\nThe programme's relaunch was strategically planned, involving a total of 70 schools across 37 communities in two distinct phases:\n\n- \u00b7 Phase 1 - a comprehensive assessment to gauge the post-pandemic educational backlog among children and evaluate the programme's relevance and impact. This phase also revisited the pre-pandemic state of learning resources, ensuring a tailored approach to current needs.\n- \u00b7 Phase 2 - foundational training activities which laid the groundwork for effective deployment of the programme.\n\nTogether with other initiatives that fall under the Quality Education SDG, 'Picando Letras' underscores our dedication to nurturing resilient\n\ncommunities - providing brighter and better opportunities in the key moments of young people's development, and ensuring that education acts as the cornerstone for future prosperity and wellbeing.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Before the consultation phase, we assess the potential impacts and benefits of our projects and develop the capacities of the communities to fully exercise their right to consultation. During consultation, we consider their preferred method of engagement, present information in a culturally-appropriate manner and reach agreements on shared benefits.\n\nIn 2018, our commitment to constructive dialogue and inclusive participation was fundamental to obtaining the free, prior\n\nand informed consent of the Raramuri indigenous peoples to build and operate a water reservoir for our San Juli\u00e1n mine. In 2021, we engaged the indigenous peoples' committee to collaborate on roads and collective water monitoring. We have since provided guidance to Indigenous Consultations in Mexico based on our experience at San Juli\u00e1n, the Mexican regulatory framework and international best practices. We are also strengthening our relationships with the indigenous peoples of Orisyvo and San Juli\u00e1n.\n\n## Land acquisitions and resettlements\n\nOur goal is to manage resettlement responsibly, respecting local laws and international best practices. Developing a mining project involves land acquisition and, in some cases, the resettlement of households. We recognise that these are complex and life-changing issues for communities. When poorly planned and managed, land acquisition and resettlement may adversely impact the livelihoods and social structure of communities, damage our relationships and even cause conflict. We recognise that the right to an adequate standard of living after land acquisition and resettlement projects is a basic human right, and strive to:\n\n- \u00b7 Avoid resettlements whenever possible, by exploring alternative options.\n- \u00b7 Work together with affected households, communities and governments to minimise adverse impacts, restoring or improving livelihoods and living conditions, if resettlements are unavoidable.\n- \u00b7 Develop our competencies and internal processes to manage resettlements, including: social baseline and asset surveys, entitlement and compensation frameworks, negotiation, livelihood restoration programmes and ongoing monitoring and evaluation.\n\n## Performance\n\nNo community resettlements occurred at our operations or development projects during 2023.\n\nWe Identify indigenous communities, proactively conducting due diligence of our exploration concessions.\n\nWe engage respectfully in a culturally-appropriate manner that recognises their culture, values and aspirations.\n\nWe implement best practices regarding the free, prior and informed consent of indigenous peoples.",

        "page_content": "## MANAGING OUR RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES\n\nWe operate in a complex global environment, where opportunities come with corresponding risks. Taking and managing risk responsibly is essential to running our business safely, effectively and in a way that creates value for all our stakeholders. Risk management is one of our management team's core responsibilities and is central to our decision-making process.\n\nThe effective management of risk is integral to good management practice and fundamental in living up to our Purpose and delivering our strategy. By understanding, prioritising and managing risk, we safeguard our people, our assets, our values and reputation, and the environment, and identify opportunities to best serve the long-term interests of all our stakeholders.\n\nUnderstanding our risks and developing appropriate responses is critical to our future success. We are therefore committed to an effective, robust system of risk identification and response, in order to support the achievement of our objectives.\n\n## Our approach\n\nEffective risk management enables us to manage both the threats and the opportunities associated with our strategy, operations and projects. Our risk management process helps us to manage material risks that have the potential to impact our business objectives. While risk management is a key accountability and performance criterion for our leaders, all employees have responsibility for identifying and managing risks. Our risk management framework reflects the importance of risk awareness across Fresnillo plc. It enables us to identify, assess, prioritise and manage risks to deliver the value creation objectives defined in our business model.\n\nTimely risk monitoring is at the core of our management practices, helping to deliver on our strategy and our commitments to stakeholders, including colleagues, communities and the planet. We are focused on conducting our business responsibly, safely and legally, while making risk-informed decisions when responding to opportunities or threats that present themselves. With the leadership of the Board and the Executive Committee and guided by our risk appetite on a riskby-risk basis, we understand, prioritise and manage our risks. Our risk management framework, which we further enhanced during the year, enables us to undertake this exercise with structure and rigour.\n\nOur Board oversees our principal risks and associated management responses, while the Audit Committee monitors the effectiveness of risk management and internal controls. Our risk management\n\nsystem comprises six core elements (see page 154) - one of which is our risk management framework, which sets out clear roles and responsibilities, standards and procedures. We also have three lines of defence (see page 153) to verify that risks are being effectively managed in line with our policy, standards and procedures, including across core business processes such as finance, health and safety, social performance, environment and major hazards.\n\nAt the front-line operational level, all employees are required and empowered to identify and manage the risks that arise within their area of responsibility. This governance structure supports our risk management framework and enables effective management of material risks.\n\nThe top risks of 2023 range across the spectrum of geopolitical, security, operational, safety, regulatory, cyber, climate change and ESG risks. We have implemented risk techniques and processes to identify new risks associated with these topics, while also analysing their impact on all our risks. Our risk management methodology is applied to all our operating units, projects, exploration activities and support areas so that we have a comprehensive view of the uncertainties that could affect the achievement of our strategic goals. The framework is based on ISO 31000 and COSO ERM 1 .\n\n## Risk management system\n\nOur risk management system is based on risk identification, assessment, prioritisation, mitigation and monitoring processes, which are continually evaluated, improved and enhanced in line with best practice.\n\nA complete view of our risk universe starts with the analysis of our business, the external environment in which we operate, the regulatory landscape and our internal operations. This includes the impacts on and of our strategy, initiatives, governance and processes. In addition to our established risk management activities, our executives (including operations and project managers, the controllership group, Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) Team and exploration managers) regularly engage in strengthening the effectiveness of our current controls. These actions support the executives and the Board in each of their responsibilities.\n\nThe Company's risk profile has been developed based on the most significant risks in our business. All our principal risks were reviewed at least twice during the year, including through Key Risk Indicators (KRIs), which were developed to help embed the risk appetite framework in the business and enhance the monitoring and mitigation of risks.\n\nThe new mining law and the labour law in Mexico, security close to our business units, the increase in the cost of operations, geopolitical instability, our licence to operate and climate disruption all posed new challenges for the risk department and the Executive Committee. Due to the uncertainty around these topics, all strategic decisions by the Company were analysed using risk scenarios modelling their potential impacts. In addition, we continue to use five key processes to better manage our risks: (i) a monthly procedure for evaluating and mitigating principal risks; (ii) a process to identify and analyse the impact of the pandemic and geopolitical instability in all the Company's risks, including projects, with a main focus on the health and safety of employees and the identification of new risks; (iii) dashboards for each business unit to monitor mitigation actions and risk level; (iv) impact and probability scenarios which were conducted for risks related to the supply chain of critical inputs for operations, cost increases and projects; and (v) collaboration with government, the mining sector, health experts and communities to ensure that we followed best practice.\n\nIt is important to recognise that the Board, the Audit Committee, the HSECR Committee and the Executive Committee periodically use working sessions to review the evolution of principal and emerging risks, as well as the appetite for each risk. At these working sessions, the views and suggestions of Board members are gathered, and adjustments are made according to the factors influencing each risk. In addition, the HSECR Committee continues to meet before every Board meeting to review the effectiveness of our risk management and internal control systems, with particular attention paid to safety, climate, tailings dams and environmental risks.",

The risk control and assessment processes in mines, exploration offices and projects have been adapted to pay attention to emerging risks. At each location, Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Community Relations risk-responsible staff monitor local information and analysis related to these emerging risks. This monitoring process involves building scenarios for three, five and ten years for each emerging risk and quarterly performance indicators that assess probability and impact.\n\nFresnillo plc defines an emerging risk as a new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, a risk that is known to some degree but is not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the Company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications for the achievement of our strategic plan. Furthermore, we consider emerging risks in the context of longer-term impact and shorter-term risk velocity. We have therefore defined emerging risks as those risks captured on a risk register that: (i) are likely to be of significant scale beyond a five-year timeframe; or (ii) have the velocity to significantly increase in severity within the five-year period.\n\nDisruption to global markets post-Covid-19 lockdowns, as well as the impact from Russia's war with Ukraine, Hamas' war with Israel and attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, has exposed vulnerabilities in the security of supply of certain raw materials for industrial production. The mining sector, like many others, faces a new reality of having to mitigate inflationary impacts across a range of inputs while dealing with macroeconomic shocks that may impact operations and costs.\n\nGlobal trade restrictions are likely to further impede supply chains with certain constraints on the supply of strategic commodities being experienced at an operational level. Rising geopolitical tensions and conflicts are likely to further exacerbate supply blockages for goods and services and will contribute to cost increases.\n\nGold and silver resources are finite, and this presents challenges for growth that requires investment in exploration and the maintenance of high-quality mines.\n\nMining is a long-term business, and so our strategy aims to create sustained value over the life of our mining operations and beyond. This involves careful allocation of key resource inputs - the natural, human, intellectual, financial, manufactured, and social and relationship capitals - which are essential to achieving this aim.\n\n1. Risk analysis Identify and evaluate risks to our strategy and objectives.\n\n2. Risk management and actions to risk appetite.\n\nImplement controls manage risks within\n\n3. Assurance Check and verify that controls and actions are effective in managing the risks.\n\n4. Communication Communicate current and emerging risk exposure.\n\n## 5. Improvement\n\nImprove controls and actions according to risk appetite.\n\nAct\n\nIn the longer term, as the world transitions to a low-carbon future and consumer demand for sustainable goods flows through the value chain, the supplydemand dynamics of commodities are expected to shift. This will lead to increasing demand for sources and solutions with low CO 2 emissions, and a lower social and environmental footprint, in addition to a growing demand for transparent, sustainable and circular value chains.\n\nTo strengthen our emerging risk management framework, during 2023 we carried out activities to: (i) identify new emerging risks in light of geopolitical instability, technological disruption and climate change; (ii) re-assess the emerging risks identified in 2022; (iii) deploy effective monitoring mechanisms; (iv) carry out horizon scanning to consider disruptive scenarios; and (v) implement mitigating control actions and enhance our risk awareness culture. These activities involved workshops, surveys and meetings with the Executive Committee, business unit leaders, support and corporate areas, as well as suppliers, contractors and customers. We also consulted third-party information from global risk reports, academic publications, risk consulting experts and industry benchmarks.\n\nOur risk management standards promote communication of up-to-date information on the Company and industry risks, trends and emerging risks. This year's emerging risk assessment determined the two most exposed emerging risks to be: 'Geopolitical instability' and 'Water stress and drought'.",

These risks are subject to our normal procedures to identify, implement and oversee appropriate mitigation actions, supported by internal audit work to provide assurance over the status of controls or mitigating actions. These principal risks are considered over the next three years as a minimum, but we recognise that many of them will be relevant for a longer period.\n\nAs part of our bottom-up process, each business unit head determined the level of perceived risk for their individual unit's risk universe, and each risk owner assessed its impact and likelihood.\n\nexecutive management then reviewed and challenged each level of perceived risk and compared it to the Fresnillo plc risk universe (185 individual risks grouped into 33 risk groups) as a whole. The results of this exercise were used as an additional input to define and assess the Company's principal risks. We conducted the same risk analysis on our advanced projects, detailing the specific risks faced by each project based on its unique characteristics and conditions.\n\nWe maintain a risk register through a robust assessment of the potential principal risks that could affect the Company's performance. This register is used to ensure that principal risks are identified in a thorough and systematic way and that agreed definitions of risk are used.\n\nWe are aware that not all risks can be completely eliminated and that exposure to some risks is necessary in the pursuit of our corporate objectives. Mining is, by its nature, a long-term business and as part of the principal risks update and evaluation process, we identify new or emerging\n\nrisks which could impact the Company's sustainability in the long run, even if there is limited information available at the time of the evaluation.\n\nDue to the effects caused by the global post-pandemic impacts of Covid-19, the Russia-Ukraine and Hamas-Israel wars, climate disruptions, the effects of global inflation, and the security, safety and environmental situations close to our operations, it has been necessary to reassess the principal risks and reorder their materiality, likelihood and impact, as well as to reassess related mitigation actions. During the first half of 2023, the risk team focused its efforts on identifying and assessing emerging risks, business continuity risks, safety risks and climate change risks against TCFD criteria. In the second half, we conducted assessments of fraud, compliance, human resources, security and internal control risks.",

        "page_content": "As a result of the annual risk assessment for the year 2023, the following main results were determined:\n\n- \u00b7 The risk of 'Potential actions by the government' is assessed as the main risk for the Company, exacerbated by the recent decisions of the current government, such as: (a) the new Mining Law published in May 2023, which complicates and limits mining activities in Mexico; (b) the restriction on the granting of new mining concessions; (c) the increase in tax audits and requirements; (d) the labour reform that prohibits outsourcing, generating complications in relations with contractors; (e) delays and complications in obtaining permits, licences and authorisations; (f) the implementation of policies that support the emission of carbon into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies; (g) the reform of the energy law that would reduce electricity supply options for end users and allocate valuable resources to maintain obsolete and costly generation technologies, with significant environmental and social impacts; and (h) the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA or TMEC) with its new labour provisions.\n- \u00b7 The 'Security' risk, arising from the accelerated increase in organised crime in the vicinity of the mining units, particularly in Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio mines (business units located in Fresnillo, Zacatecas, with the highest perception of insecurity in the country according to the reports published by INEGI 1 ); the increase in high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) in Zacatecas, Sonora and Guanajuato; and the sale and consumption of drugs inside the mines. Thefts of equipment, cars, machinery, tools and materials and threats of theft of ore, concentrates and mine and project assets have also increased.\n- \u00b7 The 'Labour relations' risk has always been a topic of close attention, especially given the changes to the Federal Labour Law in 2021, which allows for two or more unions in the Company. This year, 'Union' risk has moved up in the likelihood range due to the labour conflict that occurred at the Herradura mine in April and May 2023. The conflict is under control and did not materially impact the operation of the mine; however, there are legal issues that continue to be processed and could have negative results for the Company.\n- \u00b7 Critical risks in mining operations such as rock falls, loss of vehicle control, equipment interaction, energy contact, etc. have increased in the last three years. This is partly due to more reporting and follow-up of cases. This year we unfortunately had four fatalities, one\n\nbecause of rock falls inside the mine and three related to contact with heavy equipment. Because of this situation, the\n\n'Safety' risk has increased in likelihood. (For more information refer to the 'Safety' section on pages 98-102)\n\n- During the months of September and October, the 'Fraud' risk assessment was carried out, identifying risks and areas of opportunity in the following processes: 1. Payroll (employees and unionised), 2. Award of contracts for supplies and services, 3. Administration of contracts for supplies and services, 4. Theft of finished products during transportation, 5. Theft of unit assets (wiring, spare parts, consumables, etc.) and 6. Attack on the technological repositories of critical Company information. This year we are including the risk 'bribery and corruption' in the category of fraud risks. In all cases, internal controls and timely follow-up as well as preventive actions have been increased. Early detection actions were also reinforced. The internal audit area considered these results in its annual programme 2024.\n- \u00b7\n- \u00b7 During 2023 we worked together with the ESG department and financial controllership to analyse and assess the\n- 'Climate Change' risk, and the critical risks and opportunities that make up the 'Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures' (TCFD), assessing the potential impacts and creating risk materialisation scenarios, which are related to the financial Viability Statement. Regarding physical risks we consider: 'Changes in frequency and magnitude of extreme events such as rainfall, droughts and heatwaves affecting our operations and neighbouring communities' and 'Increase in average temperatures, reduction in annual precipitation and associated water stress'. Regarding transitional risks we consider: 'Emerging regulations such as local or transborder carbon taxes, cap and trade systems or increasing requirements from current emissions regulations', 'Changes in the regulatory framework of renewables' and 'Increase in energy prices'. (For more information refer to the Climate change section on pages 111-128).\n\n\u00b7\n\n- In terms of 'Insurable risks' , we made significant progress in 2023. For example, a team was created to manage Fresnillo plc's assets, one of the duties of which is to keep the asset inventory up to date and align operational processes relating to the maintenance of critical equipment. This makes it easier to ensure that the most important assets of the operation and the Company are insured. We also reviewed the insurance policies for the assets of the business units to ensure that they are adequately considered, in particular the coverage related to assets (heavy\n\n- mobile equipment and property) that could have a significant impact on financial issues and business interruption in case of loss. With the support of the external auditor specialised in business continuity 'Hawcroft Consulting International Group', the seven units of the Company were inspected during 2023, obtaining acceptable ratings in all cases and reducing the degree of risk for Fresnillo plc. From 2021 to 2023, 234 recommendations related to business continuity risks have been resolved.\n- \u00b7 This year, Fresnillo plc's 'Individual Risks' increased from 130 to 185 risks, which are grouped into 33 risk groups, because of the analysis of fraud, water scarcity and management, business continuity, climate change (TCFD) and cybersecurity risks.\n\n## Risk appetite\n\n- \u00b7 Defining risk appetite is key in embedding the risk management system into our organisational culture.\n- \u00b7 The Company's Risk Appetite Statement helps to align our strategy with the objectives of each business unit, clarifying which risk levels are, or are not, acceptable.\n- \u00b7 It promotes consistent decision-making on risk, allied to the strategic focus and risk/reward balance approved by the Board.\n\nWe define risk appetite as 'the nature and extent of risk Fresnillo plc is willing to accept in relation to the pursuit of its objectives'. We look at risk appetite from the context of severity of the consequences should the risk materialise, any relevant internal or external factors influencing the risk, and the status of management actions to mitigate or control the risk. A scale is used to help determine the limit of appetite for each risk, recognising that risk appetite will change over time. If a risk exceeds appetite, it will threaten the achievement of objectives and may require a change to strategy.\n\nRisks that are approaching the limit of the Group's risk appetite may require management actions to be accelerated or enhanced to ensure the risks remain within appetite levels. For catastrophic and operational risks, our risk appetite for exceptions or deficiencies in the status of our controls that have safety implications is very low. Our internal audit programme evaluates these controls with technical experts at operations and the results of that audit work will determine the risk appetite evaluation, along with the management response to any issues identified.",

This could include new stricter environmental regulations or guidelines, environmental taxes, new forms of labour and union contracting, longer and more complicated permitting and licensing processes, more complex and timeconsuming arrangements for accessing explosives, more complex or onerous tax compliance obligations for us and our contractors, as well as more frequent reviews by tax, environmental and social security authorities.\n\nThe current federal government has expressed a negative sentiment towards the mining industry and particularly open pit mining, which is why it has decided not to grant any more mining concessions during the current government term that ends in 2024 and is likely to review in detail the status of the concessions that have already been granted, seeking to remove those that are not being exploited or worked. It also promotes the right of indigenous and Afro-Mexican communities to be consulted prior to the granting of mining concessions, which could potentially affect the granting of new concessions in Mexico.\n\nIn May 2022, a reform to the mining law was approved to reserve the exploration, exploitation, benefit and use of lithium to the state. The aim is for this mineral to be used for the benefit of national development; although gold and silver are not mentioned specifically, other minerals declared as 'strategic by the state' are mentioned, and at some point, precious metals could be considered under this heading. This would directly and seriously affect the concessions currently exploited by the Company.\n\nIn May 2023, the federal government published the new mining law that will negatively affect mining activity in the country by slowing down exploration, shortening the duration of concessions, raising problems of operational continuity and forcing negotiations with\n\ncommunities. The new law shortens concessions to 30 years (five years of preparation with 25 years of operation) from 50 years, with an automatic 25-year renewal followed by a tender that could add a further 25 years, with preference for the incumbent. The maximum total length of a concession has been shortened to 80 years from 100 years. The law affects new concessions but is still unsettled with regard to current concessions, pending final rules from the respective government secretaries.\n\nThe federal government, by investing in a new petrochemical refinery in 'Dos Bocas', Tabasco, and buying an oil refinery in 'Deer Park', Texas, indicates that its energy policy promotes fuel oil and coal, which discourages the generation of energy based on clean sources. This complicates attention to and compliance with international climate change goals and standards.\n\nWe paid special attention to the following aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Government actions that negatively impact the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory changes to mining rights and adverse tax changes.\n- \u00b7 Changes in tax regulations.\n- \u00b7 Increased frequency of audits by tax authorities with particular scrutiny on the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Complications and failures to obtain water concessions due to government control or private interests.\n- \u00b7 Failures/delays in obtaining necessary environmental permits.\n- \u00b7 Disputes arising from the US-MexicoCanada Trade Agreement (USMCA or TMEC).\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nIn May 2023, the Mexican government approved a package of legal reforms to the following laws: 'Mining Law', 'Law on National Waters', 'Law on Ecological Balance and Environmental Protection' and 'General Law for the prevention and integrated management of waste in the field of mining and water concessions', which directly affect the mining sector, including, among others, the following notable aspects:\n\n- \u00b7 Granting of new concessions. Elimination of the concept of 'free land' whereby the party requesting a concession in an area that is not occupied, currently has a right to request the concession on a 'first come first served' basis. Now, all new concessions would be subject to a tender process ('licitaci\u00f3n') supervised by the federal government.\n- \u00b7 Exploration activities. The federal government will be in charge of the exploration activities directed by the public National Geological Service institution. It is possible to sign an agreement between the public\n\ninstitution and private entities to develop exploration activities for five years. The possibility of signing fiveyear agreements with the Mexican Geological Survey is envisaged so that mining companies can participate in the exploration process.\n\n- \u00b7 Duration of new concessions. New concessions would be valid for 30 years rather than the current 50 years, renewable exclusively for two periods of 25 years. For the second term of 25 years, the process will be open to tender. It is not clear how this would affect concessions that are already in the process of renewal - although from a legal view, no retroactive effect could be given to shorten the life of concessions granted before the time that the new mining law comes into effect.\n- \u00b7 Inclusion of free, prior and informed consultation with communities and indigenous peoples. In addition, the payment of 5% of profits to the communities will be added.\n- \u00b7 New grounds for cancellation of concessions, such as public utility, damage to the population, lack of indigenous consultation and new conducts that are now considered crimes.\n- \u00b7 Exploration activity stands to be most affected by the new law. Although details remain to be defined in specific rules, exploration activities will be centralised with the Mexican Geological Service, previously a government-led research agency, which will allow private exploration after reaching special collaboration agreements. This could result in public auctions of new concessions instead of a first applicant priority process. Furthermore, the concession requirements are the same for each stage of exploration resulting in a higher regulatory burden for earlystage projects. This includes the filing of future mine closure plans, when such details are hard to come by before exploration takes place.\n- \u00b7 Water concessions. Concession holders have the right to use water obtained from mining activities so long as water use rights are paid and the Company complies with the administrative processes and regulatory standards required by the National Water Commission. However, the law states that concessions for human and domestic water use should be prioritised over mining, particularly in states where drought and water scarcity are common, which could limit water concessions granted for industrial use.\n\nThe federal government reported that it would review the granting of concessions to mining companies and that no more concessions would be granted during this six-year term (which ends in 2024). It is therefore possible that it will withdraw unexploited gold and silver concessions.",

This has made it more difficult to operate with clean energy.\n\nThe federal government's implementation of policies that support the use of coal will result in more greenhouse gases being released into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energy.\n\nThe United States and Canada requested dispute settlement consultations with Mexico under the North American Free Trade Agreement (T-MEC or USMCA) over Mexico's energy policies that they consider discriminatory and harm international companies and cross-border supplies.\n\nSince 2020, the so-called 'Mining Fund', whose main objective was to distribute resources to communities neighbouring the mines, according to the royalties paid by companies under the Federal Law of Rights, has been closed. Since then, although companies continue to pay these royalties, they do not necessarily translate into investments for the communities neighbouring the mines.\n\nIn addition, the perception of corruption in Mexico remains high. The country's score in Transparency International's Corruption Perceptions Index 2023 remained relatively unchanged, despite a higher ranking. As a result, delays in obtaining permits for certain operations and/or projects remain a risk.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. With the news of the new mining law, risk scenarios were developed for each change and impact, considering the legal and operational criteria to implement the necessary mitigation and prevention measures. These scenarios are constantly being updated.\n- 2.  Commitment to constant communication with all levels of government.\n- 3.  Increased monitoring of the processes being implemented at the Ministry of Labour and Economy.\n- 4.  We continue to collaborate with other members of the mining community through the Mexican Mining Chamber to lobby against any new harmful taxes, royalties or regulations. We also support industry lobbying efforts to improve the general public's understanding of the mining industry.\n\n- 5.  We remain alert to the changes proposed by the authorities, including fiscal initiatives on energy and mining, so that we are able to respond in a timely and relevant manner. Daily monitoring, follow-up and attention to issues before the Congress of the Union that may affect the mining industry.\n- 6.

These thefts can take place inside the mines or during transportation.\n\nOur employees, contractors and suppliers face the risk of theft, kidnapping, extortion, crossfire injury or damage due to insecurity in some of the regions in which we operate.\n\nThe influence and dispute of territories by drug cartels, other criminal elements and general anarchy in some of the regions where we operate, combined with our exploration activities and projects in certain areas of drug deposit, transfer or cultivation, makes working in these areas a risk to us.\n\nThe federal government created the Secretariat of Citizen Security and Protection as part of the comprehensive strategy to reduce insecurity. It also created the National Guard, mostly comprising military personnel, with the aim of combating organised crime and drug cartels. Unfortunately, state or local police in most states are unprepared, ill-equipped and lack financial resources to combat organised crime, have low wages and are sometimes infiltrated by criminal elements.\n\nAccording to information from the Secretariat of Security and Citizen Protection, the National Guard and the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, the presence of organised crime and highimpact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) increased in 2023, in the states where our business units and projects are located, such as Zacatecas and Sonora.\n\nThe main risks we face are:\n\n- \u00b7 High-impact robberies.\n- \u00b7 Theft of assets such as minerals, equipment, instruments, inputs, etc.\n- \u00b7 Consumption and sale of toxic substances in our mining units.\n- \u00b7 Homicide.\n- \u00b7 Kidnappings.\n- \u00b7 Extortions.\n- \u00b7 Vandalism.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nA severe increased presence of organised crime in the vicinity of the mining units particularly in Fresnillo, Saucito and Juanicipio (Zacatecas State) and Penmont (Sonora State).\n\nAn increase in the number of high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping, extortion) and armed clashes in the regions where our mining units and projects are located.\n\nIncreased consumption and sale of drugs at the mining units, particularly Saucito.\n\nIncreased threats of theft of concentrates and assets at mining units and/or during transportation.\n\nIncreased theft of material, equipment, tools and spare parts from mines and projects.\n\nRoadblocks or blockages on the roads and/or highways near the mining units.\n\nThe Mexican state of Zacatecas is notorious for high levels of perceived insecurity and high rates of high-impact crime in 2023. There are records of several vehicle thefts from Company employees and organised crime checkpoints on the roads near Fresnillo and Saucito mines, as well as killings and clashes between criminal groups.\n\nThe Mexican state of Sonora is known to suffer constant attacks by organised crime gangs. Recently there have been several attacks in the areas of Magdalena, Santa Ana, Altar, Caborca, Pitiquito, Sonoyta and San Luis R\u00edo Colorado, which have endangered the continuity of mining operations and the physical integrity of workers at the Herradura and Noche Buena mines.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Our property security teams closely monitor the security situation, maintaining clear internal communications and coordinating work in areas of greater insecurity.\n- 2.  Management is fully committed to protecting our workforce.\n- 3.  We have adopted the following practices to manage our security risks and prevent and address potential incidents:\n- \u00b7 We maintain close relationships with authorities at federal, state and local levels, and it is important to note that military facilities are located close to most of our operations.\n- \u00b7 We interact and meet regularly with the National Guard; and in some cases with the Army and Navy.\n- \u00b7 We continue to implement greater technological and physical security at our operations, such as the use of a remote monitoring process in Herradura, Noche Buena and San Juli\u00e1n. In the\n\nSaucito and Fresnillo mines, in addition to the remote monitoring service, we have also built new local operating and command centres for each business unit.\n\n- \u00b7 Increase in logistical controls to reduce the potential for theft of mineral concentrate. These controls include: the use of real-time tracking technology; surveillance cameras to identify alterations in the transported material; protection and support services on distribution routes; and a reduction in the number of authorised stops to optimise delivery times and minimise exposure of trucks transporting ore concentrates or dor\u00e9.\n- \u00b7 We continue to invest in community programmes, infrastructure improvements and government initiatives to support the development of legal local communities and discourage criminal acts.\n- \u00b7 We have increased the number of antidoping tests conducted at the start of the day in the mining units.\n- \u00b7 Frequent inspections are carried out inside the mines to verify that drugs are not consumed and sold.\n- \u00b7 Drug consumption prevention campaigns are carried out, focused on employees.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Total number of security incidents affecting our workforce (thefts, kidnapping, extortion, etc.).\n- \u00b7 Number of sites affected, and workdays lost, by region and type of site.\n- \u00b7 Number of media mentions related to safety issues affecting the mining industry where we operate.\n- \u00b7 Number of high-impact crime cases in the regions where we have operations and projects.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nLow\n\n## Behaviour\n\nStable\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2023: Very high (2)\n\n2022: Very high (2)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Globally, economies almost came to a complete halt for more than five months during 2020 and some months of 2021. During 2022 and 2023, we saw significant increases in critical inputs and operating costs and higher inflationary pressures, along with a shortage of critical inputs and equipment. We expect this to continue through 2024.\n\nThis situation could create an adverse impact on our operations, costs, sales and earnings, and potentially on the economic viability of projects.\n\nIn macroeconomic terms, we have seen the following impacts in Mexico 1 :\n\n- \u00b7 The Mexican peso performed strongly during 2023 and is one of the strongest emerging currencies. On average during 2023 it traded at 17.5 pesos per US dollar. At the end of the year the dollar exchange rate was 17 pesos.\n- \u00b7 General inflation in Mexico was 4.6% for 2023.\n- \u00b7 Economic growth for Mexico during 2023 was 3.2%.\n\nOur sales are prenominal denominated in US dollars, although and important part of our operating costs are in Mexican pesos. Any strengthening of the Mexican peso may therefore negatively affect our financial results.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nThe unnerving combination of war, inflation, energy scarcity, disruption and restrictions to the supply of some of our key strategic inputs and climate change was unexpected, given that life was just beginning to move forward from the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nInflation has become a major concern for the global economy. Price rises are reaching record highs in Europe and the United States and may be countered by monetary policy. In Latin America, central banks have been acting quickly and forcefully since last year, raising interest rates.\n\nInterruption in the value chain of critical inputs for our operations such as spare parts (primarily delivered by land transport from the US and maritime transport from China and Europe).\n\nDisruptions also include reduced availability of maintenance teams/ contractors to resolve issues, as well as travel restrictions leading to officials not being able to travel and inspect projects, resulting in delays.\n\nIncreased operating costs due to higher prices for critical inputs such as steel, cyanide, copper, diesel, haulage equipment, oxygen and truck tyres.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. In macroeconomic terms, and trailing only India, China, Indonesia, and Turkey among the G20, M\u00e9xico's GDP grew 3.7% year-on-year in the first half of 2023. This expansion can be attributed to: firstly, the United States, which shared a good first half (2.2% year on year) with Mexico, is helping the nation through trade and remittances; secondly, a boom in private consumption, due to increases in real wages and a strong labour market; thirdly, gains due to nearshoring, observable through the recovery of business confidence and private investment; and, finally, major infrastructure projects (such as new refineries and transport systems), are now clearly evident in government expenditure and construction plans.\n- 2.  In microeconomics terms, to maintain our security of supply, contingency plans are in place to address any shortterm disruptions to strategic resources. We negotiate early with suppliers of key inputs to ensure continuity. Certain key supplies are purchased from several sources to mitigate potential disruption arising from exposure to a single supplier.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more details see Review of operations\n\non pages 42-63.\n\n- 3. We execute operational excellence initiatives to counter inflation and improve margins, and also enhance cost-competitiveness by improving the quality of the portfolio.\n- 4.  We maintain a rigorous, risk-based supplier management framework to ensure that we engage solely with reputable product and service providers and keep in place the necessary controls to ensure the traceability of all supplies (including avoiding any conduct related to modern slavery).\n- 5.  To achieve cost-competitiveness, we endeavour to buy the highest possible proportion of our key inputs, such as fuel and tyres, on as variable a price basis as possible and to link costs to underlying commodity indices where this option exists.\n- 6.  We are committed to incorporating sustainable technological and innovative solutions, such as using sea water and renewable power when economically-viable, to mitigate exposure to potentially scarce resources.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- For more detail see Sustainability at the\n\ncore of our purpose on pages 78-150.\n\n- 7. We have hedging policies for exchange rate risk, including those associated with project-related capex and a hedging policy for precious metals.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of delivery compliance by suppliers and contractors.\n- \u00b7 Shortages of critical operational inputs.\n- \u00b7 Increase in the price of critical inputs for the operation.\n- \u00b7 Increased cost of operation.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nLow\n\n## Behaviour\n\nStable\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2023: High (3)\n\n2022: High (3)",

There is an inherent risk when investing or planning for the future price of these precious metals.\n\nOur results are heavily dependent on commodity prices - principally gold and silver. These prices are strongly influenced by a variety of external factors, including wars, geopolitical disruption, global economic growth, inventory balances, industry demand and supply, possible substitution, etc.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nThe risk is further exacerbated when macroeconomic and geopolitical factors directly affect the price of commodities, both positively and negatively. Such factors include post-pandemic Covid-19, the wars between Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas, and generalised inflation around the world.\n\nLately, the attraction of investing in other financial instruments such as cryptocurrencies, in addition to silver and gold, has increased. This could lead to investors reducing their investment activities in precious metals.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions ignited by the conflict in the Middle East, coupled with a continuing decline in inflation rates in the United States, have propelled a remarkable rally in gold prices. After two years of mid to low prices, gold posted double-digit gains at the end of November 2023 and surpassed US$2,000 per ounce, approaching its all-time high of US$2,100 per ounce reached in August 2020. The price continued to hover around the US$2,000 per ounce barrier, as the end of the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel saw investors flock to buy what is recognised worldwide as a safehaven asset 1 .\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We consider exposure to commodity price fluctuations an integral part of our business and our usual policy is to sell our products at prevailing market prices.\n- 2.  We monitor the commodity markets closely to determine the effect of price fluctuations on earnings, capital expenditure and cash flows.

Obtaining qualified labour has become a major challenge, and our industry requires more and more people trained and experienced in mining processes. Unfortunately, there are not enough candidates with the required profiles.\n\nManaging talent and maintaining a highquality labour force in a fast-changing technological and cultural environment is therefore a key priority. Any failures in this respect could have a negative impact on the performance of the existing operations and prospects for future growth.\n\nDigital and technological innovation has the potential to generate substantial improvements in the productivity, safety and environmental management of the Company. However, to achieve this, in addition to demanding significant investment, different skillsets will be required in the workforce.\n\nThere is a risk that our workforce will either be unable to transform as needed or will be resistant to change and unwilling to accept the impact of automation or to acquire new technological skills.\n\nThe lack of reliable contractors with sufficient infrastructure, machinery, performance history and trained people is also a risk that could affect our ability to develop and build mining works.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nBusiness interruption or underperformance may arise from a lack of access to capability. Tight labour markets are leading to heightened competition for diverse talent and critical skills, such as in the areas of digital, climate and energy.\n\nChanging societal expectations are placing pressure on our corporate and employer brand - who we are and what we stand for.\n\nThere was a significant increase in staff turnover during 2023.\n\nTalent retention also became more difficult this year.\n\nAt some mines we have a lack of specialised personnel to cover working hours.\n\nIn certain regions where we operate there are not enough candidates with the necessary skills to operate the mining equipment.\n\nWith the new labour law prohibiting outsourcing, we had to hire staff from contractors, and this caused added complications.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We develop the talents of our employees through training and career development, invest in initiatives to widen the talent pool and are committed to our diversity and inclusion policy. Through these actions we aim to increase employee retention, as well as the number of women, people with disabilities and employees with international experience in the workplace.\n- 2.  Our employee performance management system is designed to attract and retain key employees by creating suitable reward and remuneration structures and providing personal development opportunities. We have a talent management system to identify and develop internal candidates for key management positions, as well as identify suitable external candidates where appropriate.\n- 3.  We aim for continuous improvement, driven by opportunities for training, development and personal growth; in short, we focus on fair recruitment, fair pay and benefits and gender equality. In the trusted staff structure, 19.24% are women, as are 31.03% of new joiners, while 28.29% of the female population was promoted during the year.\n\n- 4.  Recruitment: We have evaluated our recruitment requirements for key positions, and our goal is to meet them through internal training and promotion, as well as by recruitment through:\n- \u00b7 Our close relationships with universities that offer earth science programmes. We have programmes dedicated to identifying potential performance-based candidates who can be hired as trainees and/ or employees at graduation. During the year, we hosted 39 students from different earth science professions at our mining units to support their training, and 32 engineers took part in our training programme.\n- \u00b7 CETLAR (Centre for Technical Studies of Pe\u00f1oles), which trains mechanical and electrical technicians. All seven 2023 graduates were hired as fulltime employees.\n- 5.  Retention: Our goal is to be the employer of choice, and we recognise that to be a profitable and sustainable Company, we need to generate value for our employees and their families. We do this by providing a healthy, safe, productive and team-oriented work environment that not only encourages our people to reach their potential, but also supports process improvements. During 2023, we conducted management and leadership skills development programmes with 14 superintendents, 49 advisors and 43 facilitators.\n\nIn order to keep our staff updated and trained, 82% of employees and 92% of unionised staff received training during the year. A total of 108 employees participated in institutional development programmes, which means that 60% of staff with more than two years of service have participated at least once. Of this 60%, 11.8% are women. 585 courses and studies were provided through external training, benefiting 456 employees. 82.9% of our leaders have participated in institutional development programmes focused on leadership.",

Their objectives range from reputational damage and the halting of operations to exploiting mining's role in regional supply chains, and affecting national and global economies. Some cybercriminals look to find unprotected, misconfigured or unpatched mining systems to exploit, and with the industry's heavy reliance on technology and automated systems to support operations, this is becoming more prevalent. Others exploit social engineering (phishing) to obtain information that can compromise information systems and obtain sensitive data or even affect the operation.\n\nThe following are the top eight cybersecurity and privacy risks that have been identified through environment monitoring and workshops with business units, operations and IT. These risks comprise the Pe\u00f1oles/Fresnillo overall cybersecurity and privacy risk profile:\n\n- \u00b7 Corruption of data - Critical data where any unauthorised modification can have adverse impacts.\n- \u00b7 Unauthorised access - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents due to incorrect access permissions or system abuse, exploitation or misuse.\n- \u00b7 Breach and data theft - Disclosure of critical and sensitive Company data by an internal or external source.\n- \u00b7 Business disruption - Disrupting key applications or systems for a period.\n- \u00b7 Lack of cybersecurity ownership Failure to assign responsibility for implementing and adopting daily cybersecurity practices.\n\n- \u00b7 Non-compliance - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents resulting in noncompliance with applicable regulations, including privacy.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety incidents - Breach of availability, integrity or confidentiality of data which impacts health and safety.\n- \u00b7 Halt or loss of operations - Cybersecurity and privacy incidents which result in loss of operating licence or closure of operations.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nCyber risks have increased significantly in recent years owing in part to the Covid-19 pandemic and the proliferation of new digital technologies, the increasing degree of connectivity and a material increase in the monetisation of cybercrime.\n\nCybercriminals are using new techniques and tactics to carry out their attacks, making them more difficult to detect. Attacks targeting companies in the industrial and mining sector are becoming more sophisticated every day, due to the sector's historically low level of cybersecurity coupled with a high-potential for serious damage.\n\nTheft of information through social engineering and phishing campaigns (fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information or data, such as usernames or passwords, by appearing to be a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication).\n\nAnother important factor is the integration of digital technologies, such as Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Cloud, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), which can increase the scope for attack, due to their very design, features, and capabilities. These technologies can be used for legitimate and productive purposes (such as automating repetitive processes in a company or reinforcing its cybersecurity), but they can also be used by hackers to carry out cyberattacks.\n\nIn addition, the degree of maturity of cybersecurity and cybercrime regulations that could deter criminals is still developing at both national and global levels, but is not yet adequate.\n\nAccess to hacking services and tools is readily available, low-cost and heavily automated. Without proper punishment for perpetrators globally, attackers can easily launch sophisticated attacks with little risk.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\nThe cybersecurity function continues to update and strengthen cybersecurity in all our processes. Its activities are aligned with business strategies and responsible for safeguarding digital security as a second line of defence, reinforcing the activities that secure our information, from data repositories to the tools for transmitting and sharing information.\n\nDuring 2023 we activated the following mitigation actions:\n\n- 1. Aligned with business strategies, our cybersecurity programme is based on a governance model with three lines of defence, involving all operational, tactical and strategic business levels to prevent and mitigate computer risks.\n- 2.  We maintain continuous awareness of cybersecurity at all levels of the organisation, through workshops, communications, campaigns and exercises that allow us to understand and strengthen our cybersecurity culture. Cybersecurity is a risk that requires the more active involvement of executive teams, and during 2023 we carried out awareness and training exercises focused on this level.\n- 3.  Our approach is also based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework which is used to assess and improve our ability to prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks.\n- 4.  Efforts to increase the maturity level of the Security Operations Centre (SOC) have enabled us to benefit from improved analytics that correlate information from multiple business unit sources, helping us to easily identify the impact of a threat and address the incident in a timely manner. Cybersecurity incident response plans are in place and regularly assessed to ensure we can respond quickly and effectively to cybersecurity incidents.\n- 5.  We conduct ongoing assessments of the technology controls implemented in operations and services to maintain our risk appetite at acceptable levels. We constantly monitor threat intelligence to analyse trends in the environment, allowing us to anticipate and apply necessary controls and adjustments in our operations.",

Our investment assessment process determines how best to manage available capital using technical, financial and qualitative criteria:\n- \u00b7 Technical: We evaluate and confirm the resource estimate; conduct metallurgical research of mineral bodies to optimise the recovery of economic elements; calculate and determine the investment required for the overall infrastructure (including roads, energy, water, general services, housing) and the infrastructure required for the mine and plant.\n\n- \u00b7 Financial: We analyse the risk in relation to the return on the proposed capital investments; set the expected internal rates of return (IRR) per project as thresholds for approving the allocation of capital, based on the current value of expected cash flows of invested capital; and perform stochastic and probabilistic analyses.\n- \u00b7 Qualitative: We consider the alignment of investment with our strategic plan and business model; identify synergies with other investments and operating assets; and consider the implications for safety and the environment, the safety of facilities, people, resources and community relations.\n- 2.  The management of our projects is based on the PMBOK standard of the Project Management Institute (PMI). It allows us to closely monitor project controls to ensure the delivery of approved projects on time, within budget and in accordance with defined specifications.\n- 3.  The executive management team and the Board of Directors are regularly updated on progress. Each advanced exploration project and major capital development project has a risk record containing the project-specific identified and assessed risks.

The mining industry is inherently hazardous, with the potential to cause illness or injury, damage to the environment and disruption to communities. Our objective is first and foremost to have zero fatalities. We believe all incidents and injuries are preventable, so our focus is on identifying, managing and, where possible, eliminating risks.\n\nMajor hazards include process safety, underground mining, surface mining and tailings and water storage.\n\nOur workforce faces risks such as fire, explosion, electrocution and carbon monoxide poisoning, as well as risks specific to each mine site and development project.\n\nThese include rockfalls caused by geological conditions, cyanide contamination, explosion, becoming trapped, electrocution, insect bites, falls, heavy or light equipment collisions involving machinery or personnel and accidents occurring while personnel are being transported.\n\nA poor safety record or serious accidents could have a long-term impact on morale and on our reputation and productivity.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nWe are saddened to report that four fatalities were recorded during 2023, and also that we experienced a significant increase in accidents related to:\n\n- \u00b7 Rockfall/terrain failure.\n- \u00b7 Loss of vehicle/equipment control.\n- \u00b7 Team-vehicle-person interaction.\n- \u00b7 Accident in transport of staff.\n- \u00b7 Contact with electric power.\n- \u00b7 Fire.\n- \u00b7 Contact with hazardous substances.\n\nDuring 2023 we had 396 high-potential incidents, 6% more than 2022 1 .\n\nFrequent transportation of our people to remote business units is an ongoing feature of our operations.

Our 'Safety and Occupational Health' strategy is based on four pillars:\n- a.  Safety and health risk management: Workers at all levels are able to identify hazards and controls, so that all jobs are carried out safely.\n- b.  Leadership: All employees and contractors are health and safety leaders and we demonstrate our commitment through each individual's responsible behaviour.\n- c.

This has led to a complex, rarefied work environment at the Fresnillo mine, with violent clashes between the union and a group of workers seeking to register a new independent union.\n\nThe risk is that the fighting will continue and worsen and eventually the mine's workforce will be reduced. There is also a risk that this conflict could spread to other mines.\n\nIn addition, the TMEC (new trade agreement between Mexico, Canada and the United States replacing NAFTA) could include new labour and trade union provisions.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We maintain good relations with our employees and unions, founded on trust, regular dialogue and good working conditions. We are committed to safety, nondiscrimination, diversity and inclusion, and compliance with Mexico's strict labour regulations.\n- 2.  There are long-term labour agreements (usually three years) in place with all the unions at our operations, helping to ensure labour stability.\n- 3.  We seek to identify and address labour issues that may arise throughout the period covered by the labour agreements and to anticipate any potential issues in good time. Employees of our contractor companies are an important part of our workforce and under Mexican law fulfil the same duties and are subject to the same responsibilities as our own employees. We treat contractors as strategic associates and build long-term, mutually-beneficial relationships with them.\n- 4.  We maintain constructive relationships with our employees and their unions through regular communication and consultation. Union representatives are regularly involved in discussions about the future of the workforce.\n- 5.  Increased communication with trade union leaders in mining units to monitor the working environment.\n- 6.  Meetings have been held with groups of workers who want to introduce new unions into the Company.\n- 7. Our strategy is to integrate unionised personnel into each team in the business unit. We achieve this by clearly assigning responsibilities and through programmes aimed at maintaining close relations with trade unions in mines and at the national level.\n- 8.  We maintain close communication with trade union leaders at various levels of the organisation in order to: raise awareness of the economic situation facing the industry; share our production results; and encourage union participation in our security initiatives and other operational improvements.\n- 9.  These initiatives include the security guardians programme, certification partnerships, integration of high-productivity equipment and family activities.\n- 10. We are proactive in our interactions with unions. When appropriate, we hire experienced legal advisors to support us on labour issues. We remain attentive to any developments in labour or trade union issues.\n- 11.  We conducted a review of the contractual benefits for union members in our mines.\n- 12.

Negative sentiment towards mining or specifically towards Fresnillo plc could have an impact on our reputation and acceptability in the regions where we have a presence.\n\nWe monitor the following risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Negative perception of the Company's social and environmental performance.\n- \u00b7 Failure to identify and address legitimate concerns and expectations of the community and of society at large.\n- \u00b7 Insufficient or ineffective engagement and communication.\n- \u00b7 Failure to contribute purposefully to community development.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nHigher expectations and scrutiny of social and environmental performance.\n\nRising expectations on shared benefits regarding land agreements.\n\nPerceived competition on access to natural resources, notably water.\n\nSignificant reduction in government spending on community infrastructure, development programmes and services.\n\nAnti-mining activism fuelling opposition to mining.\n\nInsecurity and access to water are the issues of greatest concern to people and community leaders in the regions where we have a presence.\n\nThe environmental impact of a mine is also an issue that can concern communities close to our operations.\n\n- \u00b7 Environmental performance: Optimising our use of resources, curbing any negative impacts of our activities and being transparent and accountable for our environmental footprint are crucial elements of sustainable mining and help us to be perceived positively by communities and regulators.\n- \u00b7 Health and safety performance: we aim to instil a safety culture focused on 'taking care of our people', based on shared values across the organisation, driven by senior management and focused on high-potential incidents. Our 'live in balance' approach to health aims to identify and proactively manage the risks of exposure of our workforce, who are our key community spokespeople.\n- \u00b7 We take a responsible approach to managing the impacts of the reform to regulate subcontracting, with our response to the New Labour Legislation in Mexico ensuring compliance. By extending job offers to the qualified workforce, we have been able to mitigate the negative impacts of the reform on local people and communities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Partnering with our communities on pages 139-150.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Number of local actions by nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) or other local social groups against mining, by region.\n- \u00b7 Number of actions by NGOs or other local social groups against mining in the Americas.\n- \u00b7 Number of media mentions related to demonstrations against the mining industry.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nLow\n\n## Behaviour\n\nStable\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2023: Medium (11)\n\n2022: Medium (9)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Efficient risk management allows us to detect threats associated with our operation. This process helps us identify, assess, plan for, communicate and manage significant risks that could potentially impact our social licence.\n- 2. The risk identification mechanism includes social studies, our complaints and claims process, and the deployment of community programmes, as well as meetings with key stakeholders and media monitoring.\n- 3. We evaluate and prevent detected risks from materialising through specialised workshops, risk management and specific action plans for each risk.\n- 4.  Risks classified as high risk are escalated to RED teams, which work to identify specific solutions and have the decisionmaking authority to offer concrete and timely actions.\n- 5.  Continual and direct contact is maintained with the leaders of each business unit to support the discussion and mitigation of the specific risks in their areas of responsibility.\n- 6.  We continually improve our governance of complaints. All complaints are received, evaluated and managed with the involvement of those directly responsible, with dissatisfied actors being kept informed about the status of each case until satisfactory closing agreements are reached.\n- 7. We have implemented a digital 'hotline' reporting process which helps capture concerns from the community, with cases remaining anonymous if requested. This additional communications channel has increased the options available to communities and therefore their ability to bring concerns to our attention.\n- 8.  A community service programme has been implemented which includes the following features:\n- \u00b7 Promotion of our social strategy, which encompasses all phases of the mining life cycle. Key activities include communicating our best practices in social and environmental responsibility in order to avoid the materialisation of risks or mitigate their effect should they arise.\n- \u00b7 The strategy includes our desire for shared asset equity where permitted in the communities where we have a presence, maintaining our licence to operate based on trust. In addition to effective stakeholder engagement, sharing the benefits of mining also plays an important role in supporting our social acceptability. Employment, procurement, talent development and paying our fair share of taxes contribute to regional development as part of local and state economic output.",

        "page_content": "Strategic Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk description\n\nWe are highly-dependent on the success of the exploration programme to meet our strategic value-creation targets and our long-term production and reserves goals.\n\nThe growing level of insecurity, a more challenging land access scenario, and delays in obtaining government permits detailed previously, translates into a longer timeframe to deliver new discoveries and improve the category of resources. In addition, difficulties in obtaining new mineral concessions could hamper the exploration in new target areas.\n\nAs our production increases and more mines approach the end of their lives, replenishing our reserves and maintaining low costs becomes increasingly challenging.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nIn Mexico, the new mining law published in May 2023 establishes that exploration activities in new concessions will be carried out solely by the Mexican Geological Survey. New concessions would be granted through a bidding process following exploration orders submitted to the survey. However, pre-existing concessions can continue to be explored by the owners and can be traded after obtaining authorisation from the federal Ministry of Economy. Fresnillo plc concession holdings ( 1.6 million hectares) will allow us to continue with our brownfield and greenfield exploration programmes, at least in the mid-term. Obtaining access to new concessions will become difficult.\n\nThis year, we have seen complications and delays to the exploration programme, mainly for the following reasons:\n\n- \u00b7 Restrictions on new mining concessions.\n- \u00b7 Delays in procedures regarding access to land.\n- \u00b7 Presence of organised crime (insecurity) in the regions where we have projects and exploration camps.\n- \u00b7\n- Delays and failures to obtain permits and licences from government authorities.\n- \u00b7 Increased exploration costs.\n\n- \u00b7 In Chile, risk factors include lack of water in the 'Atacama' desert in the north and possibility of conflict with forestry or agricultural interests in the south, overall higher costs compared to those in Mexico, seasonal restrictions to exploration in the High Andes, scarcity of open grounds for staking, poor infrastructure in remote zones, presence of anti-mining communities or NGOs, and strong competition for mining claims and staff.\n- \u00b7 In Peru, the main risk factors include the long lead time required to obtain social permits (emphasising the need for strong community relations teams and programmes), delays in obtaining government permits, poor infrastructure in mountainous regions, the presence of anti-mining communities or NGOs and the possibility of illegal mining.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. Maintaining a reasonable investment in exploration, even when metals prices are low, has been our policy through the years. While continuous investment has always been a hallmark of our exploration strategy, replenishing exploited reserves and increasing our total amount of resources could be a challenge in the future.\n- 2.  During 2023, we invested a total of US$186.0 million in exploration activities. Our objectives for 2024 include a budgeted risk capital investment in exploration of approximately US$190.0 million.\n- 3.  The approximate spending split is 55% for operating mines (reserves and resources) and 45% for the exploration division, which in turn applies a balanced, priority-based process to allocate the budget.\n- 4.  For reference, the mines division uses approximately 60% of its budget for resource conversion and ore grade certainty, and 40% for step-out and expansion drilling. Furthermore, the exploration division budget for 2024 will allocate 38% to brownfield targets, 29% to advanced projects and 33% to early exploration stages including regional prospecting work.\n- 5.  Our exploration strategy also includes:\n- \u00b7 A focus on increasing regional exploration drilling programmes to intensify efforts in the districts with high-potential.\n- \u00b7 For local exploration, aggressive drilling programmes to upgrade the resources category and convert inferred resources into reserves.\n- \u00b7 A team of highly-trained and motivated geologists, including both employees and long-term contractors.\n\n- \u00b7 Advisory technical reviews by international third-party experts and routine use of up-to-date and integrated GIS databases, cuttingedge geophysical and geochemical techniques, large to small-scale hyperspectral methods, remote sensing imagery and analytical software for identifying favourable regions to be field checked by the team.\n- \u00b7 A commitment to maintain a pipeline of drill-ready high-priority projects.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Our strategy on pages 22-27.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Drill programmes completed (overall and by project).\n- \u00b7 Change in the number of ounces in reserves and resources.\n- \u00b7 Rate of conversion from resources to reserves.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nHigh\n\n## Behaviour\n\nStable\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2023: Medium (12)\n\n2022: Medium (12)",

It demands a long-term outlook to address both physical risks and transition risks, and the uncertainties that both categories entail.\n\nThe mining industry specifically is highlyexposed and sensitive to climate change. The societal responses to transition to a low-carbon economy include more stringent regulations to reduce emissions, a transformation of the global energy system, changes in behaviour and consumption choices, and emerging technologies.\n\nOn the other hand, our operations and projects are expected to face acute physical risks from extreme weather events such as high temperatures, droughts and extreme rainfall from more frequent and intense hurricanes in the Pacific. These natural disasters may affect the health and safety of our people, damage access roads and mine infrastructure, disrupt operations and affect our neighbouring communities.\n\nIn addition, the mining industry is also expected to face chronic risks, such as the rise in temperatures, which may increase our water demand, or a decrease in annual precipitation, that most certainly will exacerbate water stress in the regions where we operate. These risks may also intensify the competition to access water resources, increasing risks to the social licence to operate.\n\nDrought in northern and central Mexico is already affecting water availability in the Fresnillo (Zacatecas) and Penmont (Sonora) districts, while higher than expected rainfall in the Sierra district (Durango and Chihuahua) is affecting infrastructure in the region. In addition, the increasing severity of storm surges is causing delays in the delivery of key supply materials.\n\nThe most important risk we currently face relates to compliance with all the provisions and requirements of international agreements to reduce pollution and GHG emissions, and regulatory disclosure standards, which are subject to regulatory jurisdiction in both Mexico and the UK.\n\nFailure to adapt to the transition and physical impacts of climate change, include:\n\n- \u00b7 Government legislation to reduce social and environmental impact, including limiting mining activities.\n- \u00b7 Regulations limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the mining industry.\n- \u00b7 Acute physical risks such as the increased likelihood of extreme weather events.\n- \u00b7 Chronic physical risks such as changing weather patterns, including rising temperatures and sea levels.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nSimply staying up to date with the latest iteration of climate-related standards will no longer be seen as sufficient going forward.\n\nThe Mexican government's implementation of policies that support the use of coal will lead to more GHG emissions being released into the atmosphere and reduce the development of renewable energies in the country.\n\nCurrent and emerging climate regulations, such as carbon pricing mechanisms, have the potential to result in increased cost, shift our products' supply and demand dynamics, and create legal compliance issues and litigation, all of which could impact the Group's financial performance and reputation.\n\nOur operations also face business continuity risk due to the physical impacts of climate change, including extreme weather events, such as hurricanes or heavy rainfall, or chronic risks that may change climate patterns, such as more frequent droughts or increased temperatures.\n\nRising temperatures will exacerbate water stress in some regions, undermining the performance of water-dependent operations, complicating site restoration and bringing companies into direct competition with communities for water resources.\n\nEmployee health and safety may be put at risk by increases in communicable diseases, exposure to heat-related illnesses and the likelihood of accidents related to rising temperatures.\n\nObtaining and maintaining a licence to operate will become more difficult in communities where climate change exacerbates existing vulnerabilities and increases direct competition for resources between the Company and the community.\n\nThe supply of critical inputs to mining processes, such as water and energy, is also likely to face greater constraints and price surges.\n\nIncreased vulnerability to the aforementioned risks will make project financing more difficult to secure and drive up insurance costs.\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We recognise that climate change is a threat to human life and the planet as we know it today; we are therefore strengthening our Company-wide climate change risk culture, underlining our commitment to take action to protect the planet's climate.\n- 2.  Climate change has formed part of our strategic thinking and investment decisions since our Initial Public Offering (IPO), demonstrated by our power self-supply strategy and evolution towards renewable sources.\n- 3.  We measure and report our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, backed by assurance in recent years. We are also committed to increasing the share of renewables in our energy portfolio. On water scarcity, we are reducing our reliance on underground water through more efficient water usage and increased use of municipal wastewater as a proportion of our total water consumption.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Climate change on pages 111-128, Energy on pages 108-110 and Water stewardship pages 134-136.\n\n- 4.  We report according to the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) regarding: a) Governance, b) Strategy, c) Risk Management and d) Metrics and targets. This year, the ESG, financial controllership and risk departments collaboratively reassessed the Company's Climate Risk and Opportunities (CROs) analysis and recalibrated climate scenarios. Work is ongoing to define criteria for financial analysis. Additionally, strides have been made towards compliance with cross-industry and metals and mining industry indicators.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see our TCFD disclosure on pages 111-128.\n\n- 5.  We recognise the importance of maturing our approach to integrating physical climate change risks and adaptation into financial planning and decision-making processes. We are committed to enhancing our understanding of the site-level impacts and vulnerabilities to refine our adaptation measures. Work is ongoing to strengthen the site-level climate risk framework.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see TCFD disclosure on pages 111-128.",

A failure, collapse or overtopping of any of our TSFs could result in fatalities, damage to the environment, regulatory violations, reputational damage and disruption to the quality of life of neighbouring communities as well as our operations.\n\nHaving permits, licences and certifications from the government to be able to operate becomes a risk due to the time involved in these procedures and the legal complications.\n\nPlanning new tailings dams with the necessary time and to international standards is a major risk, due to the limitations of the land around our mines and the costs and time involved in construction. If we fail to plan or construct dams in a timely manner, we run the risk of disrupting operations.\n\n## Factors contributing to risk\n\nSome historic tailings dams have been designed, constructed and operated, under old controls and standards, which do not comply with all recommended best practices.\n\nHistoric tailings dams located in rural areas are now surrounded by facilities or residential areas, increasing the consequences of failure.\n\nTailings dams failures could lead to landslides or cave-ins.\n\nThe climate in recent years has become harsher in the regions where we operate, including more severe and prolonged rainfall and high winds that impact the geomembrane liners, as well as snowfall and frost that complicate operations, among other factors.\n\nThese initiatives included:\n\n- \u00b7 Updating the inventory of the TSFs and validating the data log.\n- \u00b7 Initiating a third-party review programme of dam safety inspections for all TSFs.\n- \u00b7 Establishing an Independent Tailings Review Panel (ITRP) comprising renowned international experts.\n- \u00b7 Accelerating a review programme by independent experts for all sites.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the ITRP's findings and prioritising recommendations arising from inspections.\n- 9.  The Board and the HSECR Committee continue to keep these issues under scrutiny.\n- 10. Periodically we are inspected by the ITRP, which issues corrective and preventive recommendations to keep the tailings dams in good condition.\n- 11.  The business continuity risks of all Fresnillo plc tailings deposits are reviewed annually by experts from Hawcroft Consulting Group.\n\nIt is important to note that our tailings dams differ from those involved in highprofile incidents, such as the tragedy in Brazil.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more details see Tailings and mineral waste management on pages 129-133.\n\n## Key risk indicators\n\n- \u00b7 Percentage of TSFs that comply with international design and construction standards.\n- \u00b7 Findings of the ITRP.\n- \u00b7 Dam safety inspections and dam safety reviews.\n- \u00b7 Storage capacity vs levels of operation.\n\n## Link to strategy\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Risk appetite\n\nLow\n\n## Behaviour\n\nStable\n\n## Risk rating (relative position)\n\n2023: Medium (14)\n\n2022: Medium (13)\n\n## Controls, mitigating actions and outlook\n\n- 1. We manage our TSFs in a manner that allows the effectiveness of their design, operation and closure to be monitored at the highest levels of the Company.\n- 2.  Catastrophic failures of TSFs are unacceptable and their potential for failure is evaluated and addressed throughout the life of each facility. Our TSFs are constantly monitored and all relevant information is provided to the authorities, regulating bodies and the communities that could be affected.\n- 3.  We manage our TSFs using data, modelling, and construction and operating methods validated and recorded by qualified technical teams and reviewed by independent international experts, whose recommendations we implement in order to strengthen the control environment. Risk management includes timely risk identification, control definition and verification. Controls are based on the consequences of the potential failure of the tailings facilities.\n- 4.  The Global Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) was published in 2020 and we have committed to adopting this standard at all our operations. We launched a new tailings policy during the year, based on the GISTM, reinforcing our commitment to the safety and health of our workforce, communities and the environment.\n- 5.  In accordance with this new standard, we have updated our risk assessment methods with a focus on more detailed risk identification, failure modes and controls in order to avoid catastrophic failures.\n- 6.  Our tailings policy ensures the stability of our TSFs throughout their life cycles, managing any potential or actual impact on the environment with sound governance and open communication with stakeholders.\n- 7. The Executive Committee is well aware of the risks associated with tailings dams. Therefore, before we construct a reservoir, we carry out a series of studies to confirm the suitability of the area. These studies include geotechnical, geological, geophysical, hydrological and seismic analyses. Before construction begins, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), through the Federal Office for Environmental Protection (PROFEPA), conducts several assessment studies and then continues to periodically review deposits in relation to the works.\n- 8.  In 2023 we launched a number of initiatives to align our governance practices with current best practices.",

The Group maintains life-of-mine plans covering the full remaining mine life for each mining operation.\n\nAs discussed above, we closely monitor and assess the impact of key principal and emerging risks on our long-term prospects and, where possible, proactively build response plans into our investment decisions.\n\nOur long-term planning reflects our business model of running our business in ways that are safer, smarter and more sustainable. To ensure we remain resilient in the long term, our business model is continuously stress tested against the key uncertainties within the emerging risks, with recommended actions to mitigate potential downside.\n\nThe Directors reviewed the viability period and confirmed the suitability of a five-year period to December 2028. This period aligns with the mining industry's typical planning cycle and with the Company's five-year forecast period normally used to evaluate liquidity and contingency plans. It allows us to model capital expenditure and development programmes planned during the timeframe and reflects cash flows generated by the projects currently under development. Due to the long business cycles in our industry, the Directors considered that a shorter time period would be insufficient.\n\nReporting on the Company's viability requires the Directors to consider those principal risks that could impair the solvency and liquidity of the Company. In order to determine those risks, the Directors robustly assessed the Groupwide principal risks and operation-specific risks by undertaking consultations with executive management, mine managers and other personnel across our operations. These consultations also enabled the Directors to identify low probability, high loss scenarios - 'singular events' - with the potential magnitude to severely impact the solvency and/or liquidity of Fresnillo.\n\nFor the purpose of assessing the Group's viability, the Directors identified that of our principal risks, the following are the most important:\n\n- \u00b7 'Potential actions by the government' , which could include a delay in obtaining permits and/or new regulations leading to restrictions on the granting of new mining concessions.\n- \u00b7 'Security' , especially the theft of explosives in the most insecure region.\n- \u00b7 'Global macroeconomic developments', specifically inflation of costs of critical inputs to the operation.\n- \u00b7 'Impact of metals prices' , notably volatility in the prices of gold and silver over a period.\n- \u00b7 'Access to land' , especially due to disputes with the owners of the land where we have operations.\n- \u00b7 'Safety' , particularly in scenarios that consider fire, severe flooding, and fatalities.\n- \u00b7 'Tailings dams' , especially the failure, collapse or overtopping of a tailings dam.\n- \u00b7 'Union' , the possibility of a strike by unionised workers at the La Herradura mine.\n\nWe also considered the impact of climate change on the viability scenarios, in particular the effects of winter storms and heavy rainfall. However, our conclusion was that the most important scenarios are not materially affected at this stage.\n\nHaving determined that none of the individual risks would in isolation compromise the Group's viability, the Directors went on to group principal risks into the following severe but plausible scenarios, in each case determining the risk proximity (how soon the risk could occur) and velocity (the speed with which the impact of a risk could be felt):\n\n## Scenario 1: Impact of metals prices and\n\nglobal macroeconomic developments. Our model assumes that prices for gold and silver in 2023 fall to US$1,622 per oz and US$20.7 per oz respectively. We further assume that precious metals prices remain at a low level for the following four years of the viability period, varying between US$1,622-US$1,667 per gold ounce and US$20.7-US$21.2 per silver ounce.\n\nTo create an impartial projection for a future low metals prices environment, the Directors used an average of the three lowest forecasts for each year of the assessment, based on consensus estimates published by institutional financial analysts.\n\nThis environment was deemed to be the most significant risk, and pervasive across the Company. (Principal risk)\n\n## Scenario 2: Bench collapse at an open\n\npit mine. A landslide occurs covering the lower pit of La Herradura mine. Due to the unexpected nature of the event, fatalities occur. Production is gradually ramped back up and re-established to full capacity. (Singular event)\n\n## Scenario 3: Tailings deposit breach at\n\na mine. A tailings deposit collapses and tailings are released into the surrounding area, causing environmental damage. A fund is created by the Company to be used to remediate and compensate for any damage caused. The investigation into the causes of the event is drawn out and further time is required before all environmental permits are reinstated. As a result, the mine remains closed throughout the viability assessment period. (Principal risk)\n\nScenario 4: Flooding at a mine. A failure occurs in the rock mass of the Saucito mine that contains excess water, which causes a strong entry of water into the mine above the pumping capacity, thus stopping production in one of the main areas. This situation causes the loss of permits, additional costs and expenses, and reputational damage. Recovery to pre-event production levels begins once management determines it is safe to do so. (Singular event)\n\n## Scenario 5: Action by the government at a\n\nmine. Explosives are stolen at the Fresnillo mine, causing the authorities to suspend the mine's explosives permit. Production is halted while an investigation into the matter is completed. Once permits have been restored, production ramps back up to pre-event levels. (Principal risk)\n\n## Scenario 6: Fire in a process plant.\n\nA major fire breaks out at the DOB plant at the San Juli\u00e1n mine, causing multiple damage to operating equipment, significant business interruption and loss of licences and permits, as well as reputational and environmental damage. (Singular event)\n\n## Scenario 7: Total power failure at a mine.\n\nPower is totally lost at San Juli\u00e1n mine due to a severe winter storm in the Chihuahua and Durango region, resulting in business interruption, additional costs, and failure to meet established objectives and targets. (Singular event)",

Due to differences in profit sharing and other demands of unionised employees, a long-lasting strike breaks out in La Herradura mine, causing business disruption, additional costs and expenses, reputational damage and complications with communities near the mine. (Principal risk)\n\nThe hypothetical scenarios above are 'extremely severe' in order to create outcomes that have the ability to threaten the viability of the Group. However, multiple control measures are in place to prevent and mitigate any such occurrences and the likelihood of these risks materialising is very low. Should any of these scenarios take place, various options are available to the Company in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to continue in operation, including the deferral of capital and/or exploration expenditure. When quantifying the expected financial impact and remediation time required for each of these risks, management performed benchmarking against the Group's own experience and against publicly available information on relevant, comparable incidents in the mining industry.\n\n## GOING CONCERN\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic report on pages 2-187. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial review in pages 64-75. In addition, note 31 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2025 (the 'going concern period'). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2023 (US$534.6 million) and the net current asset position (US$1,167.0 million). In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US$22.8/ ounce and US$1,793/ounce respectively throughout the going concern's period, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure while only considering\n\nAll scenarios were first evaluated using metals prices based on average analyst consensus. As no mitigations were necessary, it was decided that there was no threat to the viability of the Company. To create a more stringent test and further challenge the resilience of the Group, all scenarios were then overlaid with scenario one, (low metals prices) and then reevaluated.\n\nWhen these scenarios were re-modelled, none led to an extremely low or negative cash balance because the strong cash and other liquid funds balance at the end of 2023 (US$534.6 million) positions Fresnillo plc in a healthy financial situation. In addition, metals prices contribute to the preservation of a positive cash balance position through the scenarios assessed.\n\nThe lowest cash balance level was identified in scenario number two (-US$751.3 million), in combination with the low metals prices scenario. However, by implementing mitigation measures, we could continue to operate under normal conditions without significant or relevant impacts. In addition, in January 2024 the Company contracted a US$350 million revolving credit line for a period of five years.\n\nprojects approved by the Executive Committee. This resulted in a lower cash position, but still increase the cash balance year-on-year, maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period. Finally, to maintain a strong liquidity, during January 2024, the Company entered into a committed syndicated revolving credit facility ('the facility') with a maximum amount available of US$350.0 million. The terms of this facility include financial covenants related to leverage and interest cover ratios and the facility is available for a period of five years. Under all going concern scenarios modelled, management forecasts compliance with such covenants.\n\nThe Directors have further calculated prices (US$19.7/ounce and US$1,579/ounce for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2025 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2025, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metal prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period, management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. On the other hand, management could\n\nRisk management and internal control systems are in place throughout the Group. The internal control systems enable the Directors to monitor key variables that have the ability to impact the liquidity and solvency of the Group. We are confident that management is able to sufficiently mitigate any situations as they might occur.\n\nOur risk mitigation and control measures include a Crisis Committee, while the Board would also be briefed and convened as necessary, in order to respond to events as they develop. At each level of our organisation, we have appointed dedicated personnel responsible for media management and engaging with authorities and other stakeholders, depending on the magnitude of the crisis.\n\nBased on the results of this robust analysis and having considered the established controls for the risks and the available mitigating actions, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the fiveyear period of their detailed assessment. This longer-term assessment process supports the Directors' statements on both viability, as set out above, and going concern.\n\namend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Dear shareholder\n\nIt is my honour to introduce this governance section of our annual report. As Chairman of Fresnillo plc, I continue to be well aware of the expectations that all our stakeholders place on the Board, particularly in respect of our leadership in promoting high standards of corporate governance. To demonstrate our commitment to those high governance standards, I am pleased to highlight some of the key areas of progress that we have made during 2023.\n\nDuring the 12 months since our last annual report, the Board has responded to a number of new challenges which are discussed in the Strategic report and elsewhere in this annual report. The Board has taken the necessary time to understand how these challenges might impact our operations and has worked with the Management Team to respond accordingly. Consequently, we devoted significant Board time during the year to a review of the latest mining and regulatory developments in Mexico and the steps proposed by management in response to those developments. Furthermore, for the second year running, in July we held a working meeting of the Board to provide Directors with a chance to discuss wider strategic issues more extensively with our Executive Team. This year, the key topics for discussion included: a review of Fresnillo's Purpose, Mission, Vision, Values and Business Model; five megatrends in the global mining industry; the quantification of potential production growth; mine, exploration and development strategies; and ESG (environment, social and governance) and climate strategy. This meeting has proved to be a useful opportunity for the Board to keep its focus on strategic issues with our Executive Team outside of, and in addition to, the regular annual reviews of the business plan and budget.\n\nThe Board, supported in particular by the Audit and HSECR Committees, has continued to develop its arrangements for the oversight of ESG activities and climate-related risks and mitigation programmes. Fresnillo's disappointing safety record during 2023, which involved four fatal accidents (with one more occurring in January 2024), has been a cause of significant concern at Board level during the year and we cannot stress enough the urgent need for our Management Team to improve the safety culture across all of our sites, including the implementation of stricter disciplinary measures. In November 2023 the Board approved the creation of new executive roles for its operations and projects: Chief Operating Officer North and Chief Operating Officer Central. Further details of the work of the HSECR Committee are set out in the Sustainability report on pages 78-150. Further information about the role split can be found on page 211.\n\nIt was a privilege to be able to hold our 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM) in person again in London in May. I was pleased and grateful that all of the resolutions proposed at the meeting were strongly supported by our shareholders, including some minor changes to our Directors' Remuneration Policy to allow the Board to reasonably increase Non-executive Directors' fees as necessary or advisable without recourse to shareholders. We do not anticipate making any further changes to the Directors' Remuneration Policy until the next scheduled renewal at the 2026 AGM.\n\nIt was also satisfying that shareholders supported the reappointment of Charlie Jacobs and B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera as Independent Non-executive Directors at the 2023 AGM, despite the fact that they have now been on the Board for more than nine years. These are two high-calibre Directors, and I am grateful that we have had the benefit of Charlie and B\u00e1rbara's wisdom and support for another year. During the year the Nominations Committee was fully focused on the task of identifying suitable nominees as Independent Non-executive Directors and proposing them by the 2024 AGM. The Committee has recommended to the Board that Ms Luz Adriana Ram\u00edrez and Ms Rosa V\u00e1zquez be appointed at the forthcoming AGM as Independent Nonexecutive Directors in place of B\u00e1rbara and Charlie. Ms Ram\u00edrez is a dynamic senior executive who will bring a successful career across multiple industries. She is a strong leader, motivating teams to deliver on strategy and objectives. Ms V\u00e1zquez is a strong people leader with a track record of developing talent, motivating teams and driving engagement, and will bring the experience and technical knowledge to add value to the Board, particularly an orientation to best practices and governance. Further information about this process can be found in the Nomination Committee report on pages 209-211. I am also pleased to confirm that Dame Judith Macgregor will be replacing Charlie Jacobs as the Senior Independent Director with effect from the date of the AGM.\n\nBeing the third year since we last undertook an externallyfacilitated Board effectiveness review, we invited Lintstock to manage our annual Board and committees review using both interviews and questionnaires, which they did in September and October. Their findings and recommendations were discussed by the Board at its meeting in October 2023. We were pleased to note that the key outcome of the review was that the Board and its committees continue to perform very well both in absolute and relative terms, compared to a wide sample of companies. There were some helpful suggestions made by Lintstock as a result of the review which we have considered and will act upon over the coming months. Further details about this exercise are set out on pages 206-208.\n\nAs ever, I would like to conclude this letter by thanking my Board colleagues for their continuing support both to me and to the Executive Team, as well as for their valuable contributions to the work of the Board and its committees during the year. We continue to face challenges in changing times, but I remain firm in my belief that the Board is well-placed to provide the right leadership and guidance to enable the whole Fresnillo plc team to respond to those challenges effectively during 2024 and the coming years.\n\nI also wish to express my sincere thanks to our shareholders for their continued support as well as to all Fresnillo plc's personnel for their daily, continued efforts.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Board 4 March 2024",

Further information about changes to the Executive Committee can be found on pages 199211. The Non-Independent Non-executive members of the Board (Pe\u00f1oles-appointed Directors) maintain regular contact with the Executive Committee to challenge and/or support as appropriate.\n\nThis structure creates two levels of oversight for the Senior Management Team, initially from the Non-Independent Nonexecutive Directors, and then from the Board as a whole, including the Independent Non-executive Directors. Reports summarising the discussions which take place between the non-Independent\n\nNon-executive Directors and the senior Management Team are regularly provided to the Independent Non-executive Directors to assist them in understanding the dialogue which takes place before formal Board proposals are submitted for their review.\n\nThe Board sets the corporate values underpinning the culture by which the Group will continue to operate. The Board also supervises the management of the Group's activities, including the implementation of both the Group's long-term plans and commercial strategy. It also provides the governance framework within which the Executive Committee operates. The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for its approval which includes major expenditure, investments, key policies and systems of internal control and risk management. Certain specific responsibilities are delegated to the Board committees, being the Audit, Nominations, Health, Safety, Environment and Community Relations (HSECR) and Remuneration Committees, each chaired by a Board member, and each of which operate within clearly defined terms of reference and report regularly to the Board.",

Experience in national and  international accounting and audit practice and corporate governance.   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Georgina Kessel  (appointed to the Committee  on 1 March 2021)                                                          | Public finance experience from her career in government.

B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera was appointed to the Committee on 14 May 2014; Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Charles Jacobs were appointed to the Committee on 29 April 2021. During the year, B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera and Charles Jacobs were both Independent Non-executive Directors and therefore the majority of the members of the Nominations Committee were independent in compliance with the requirements of the Code. Both Mr Jacobs and Ms Garza Lag\u00fcera will cease to be Independent Non-executive Directors after the 2024 AGM. The Board, at its meeting held on 28 February 2024, approved a recommendation from the Nominations Committee that Ms Georgina Kessel and Ms Guadalupe de la Vega be appointed as members of the Nominations Committee in place of Ms Garza Lag\u00fcera and Mr Jacobs, to be effective from the 2024 AGM.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information about the work of the Nominations Committee during 2023 can be found in the Nominations Committee report on\u00a0pages 206-211.\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nThe membership of the Committee is made up of Non-executive Directors who are able to bring the following perspectives to the working of the Remuneration Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 An understanding of shareholder expectations.\n- \u00b7 An understanding of the general approaches to remuneration within the Mexican market.\n\nThe Code states that the Remuneration Committee should be made up of Independent Non-executive Directors. The members of the Remuneration Committee are Alberto Tiburcio, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res and Guadalupe de la Vega. Guadalupe de la Vega was appointed as a member of the Committee on 1 March 2021 and Alberto Tiburcio and Alejandro Baill\u00e8res were appointed as members of the Committee on 29 April 2021. Alejandro Baill\u00e8res was non-independent at the time of his appointment to the Board (and therefore the membership makeup of the Remuneration Committee during the year does not comply with Provision 32 of the Code). At the time of the appointment of Alejandro Baill\u00e8res to the Remuneration Committee in April 2021, the Board determined that his experience and knowledge of both the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations, justifies his membership of the Committee.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Further information about the work of the Remuneration Committee during 2023 can be found in the Remuneration Committee report on pages 225-243.\n\n## HSECR Committee\n\nThe members of the HSECR Committee are Arturo Fernandez, Judith Macgregor, Georgina Kessel and Fernando Ruiz.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA full report of the work of the HSECR Committee during 2023, can be found in the HSECR Committee report on pages 76-77.\n\n## Terms of reference\n\nThe terms of reference of all of the Board Committees were reviewed during the year. The terms of reference of the Nominations and Remuneration Committees were last updated in early 2020 (to take account of the requirements of the 2018 Code). The terms of reference of the HSECR Committee were last updated in October 2020. The terms of reference of the Audit Committee were updated in early 2023 (to consider the Company's obligations under TCFD, and on greenhouse gas reporting and other related topics). No further changes were made to any of the Committee terms of reference during the previous 12 months.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernance",

        "page_content": "## UK CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CODE COMPLIANCE STATEMENT\n\nAs a Company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange, Fresnillo is required under the FCA Listing Rules to comply with the Provisions of the Code (a copy of which can be found on the website of the Financial Reporting Council www.frc.org.uk) or otherwise explain its reasons for non-compliance. The following statement is therefore made in respect of the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nFor the financial year ended 31 December 2023 other than as set out below, the Company has complied with the provisions of the Code:\n\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 9 provides that 'the chair should be independent on appointment'. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was appointed as Chairman on 29 April 2021, was appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement (see page 203); thus, at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res, the previous Chairman, for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant knowledge and experience of the Company to carry out the role of the Chairman. The Board considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles Group enhances the quality of its corporate governance rather than detracts from it (as explained further on pages 201-203). As a consequence, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company. The size, composition and balance of skills on the Board, including the independence and diversity of the Board and the existence of a Senior Independent Director and the adequacy of the succession plans, were assessed as part of the Board effectiveness review during the year and were considered to be highly satisfactory.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 32, which provides that the Board should establish a Remuneration Committee of at least three Independent Non-executive Directors. The Chairman of the Company, Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, who was not independent at the time of his appointment, is a member of the Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' experience and knowledge of both the Group and the Mexican market and his considerable contribution to the Remuneration Committee's deliberations, justifies his membership of the Remuneration Committee. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is not involved in matters concerning his own remuneration.\n- \u00b7 Code Provision 36, which provides that remuneration schemes should promote long-term holdings by Executive Directors that support alignment with long-term shareholder interests. The Company's approach to executive remuneration is explained in the Directors' Remuneration report on pages 225-243. The Company does not use share-based forms of remuneration because historically it has not been a common form of remuneration in Mexico. The annual bonus scheme sets targets which are aligned to the long-term strategic objectives so that these priorities are embedded within the day-to-day activities of the Company's business.\n\nInformation about compliance with the Code's Provisions may be found in the following sections of this report:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#1\n\nBoard leadership and purpose:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nPages 201-203.\n\nPages 204-205.\n\nPages 206-211.\n\nPages 212-224.\n\nPages 225-243.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDivision of responsibilities:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe following sections of this report also explain how the principles of the Code were applied and provide cross-references to other sections of the report and/or the Company's website (www.fresnilloplc.com) where more detailed descriptions are available.\n\nThe following documents are available on the Company's website:\n\n- \u00b7 Schedule of Matters reserved for the Board.\n- \u00b7 Statement of Responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and Senior Independent Director.\n- \u00b7 Terms of Reference: Audit Committee, HSECR Committee, Nominations Committee and Remuneration Committee.\n- \u00b7 Directors' Remuneration Policy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#3\n\nComposition, succession and evaluation:\n\nincluding the Nominations Committee report\n\n#5\n\n## Remuneration:\n\nincluding the Directors' Remuneration report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#4\n\nAudit, risk and internal control: including the Audit Committee report",

The Board members continue to ensure that the business model and strategy, described on pages 20-27 and agreed by the Board, is delivered for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders. The section 172 Statement on page 37 examines how those different categories of stakeholders are considered.\n\n## Principle B:\n\nThe board should establish the company's purpose, values and strategy, and satisfy itself that these and its culture are aligned. All directors must act with integrity, lead by example and promote the desired culture.\n\nThe Board has considered the Group's business model and strategy as outlined on pages 20-27; an explanation of the code of conduct which prescribes the Directors' role is given on page 201.\n\n## Principle C:\n\nThe board should ensure that the necessary resources are in place for the company to meet its objectives and measure performance against them. The board should also establish a framework of prudent and effective controls, which enable risk to be assessed and managed.\n\nApplication of principle C, to identify the resources needed to operate the business successfully, is delegated to the Executive Management whose experience is described on pages 198199, although the Board monitors this against key performance indicators. Page 222 details the internal control structure in place and pages 151-155 describe in detail the risk management structure. During the year the Board held a working meeting with Executive Management to satisfy itself over the robustness of the Group risk management processes.\n\n## Generation and preservation of Company value\n\nFresnillo's Business Model and Strategy is set out on pages 20-27 of the Strategic report and describes the basis upon which the Company generates and preserves value over the long term.\n\nThe Executive Committee members report on the implementation of strategy at each Board meeting, with particular reference to performance against the published strategic targets.\n\n## Purpose\n\nOur Purpose is to contribute to the wellbeing of people, through the sustainable mining of silver and gold. The Purpose statement was approved by the Board in October 2019. During 2023, the Company has continued to contribute to the wellbeing of people including employees, local communities, customers and the end-users of our products by maintaining levels of production and investing in local health care, employment and education programmes.\n\n## Principle D:\n\nIn order for the company to meet its responsibilities to shareholders and stakeholders, the board should ensure effective engagement with, and encourage participation from, these parties.\n\nEngagement of stakeholders in accordance with Section 172 of the Companies Act is detailed on page 37, further details with regard to engagement with the community is outlined on pages 33 and 139-141, and with shareholders on page 36.\n\n## Principle E:\n\nThe board should ensure that workforce policies and practices are consistent with the company's values and support its long-term sustainable success. The workforce should be able to raise any matters of concern.\n\nThe Board has appointed a Non-executive Director to be responsible for employee engagement, and the processes involved in that role are detailed on pages 40-41. The procedure to ensure that employees, and other stakeholders, can raise immediate concerns via the Company's whistleblowing procedures is explained on page 84.\n\n## The Board and culture\n\nThe Corporate Code of Conduct was last reviewed and approved by the Board in October 2022. The Code of Conduct sets down its cultural expectations for the activities of all Directors, executives, employees and related third parties (including contractors, suppliers and the community) in the conduct of the Company's business. It also helps to ensure a foundation of values and sets standards for behaviour that encourage an environment of ethics and responsibility for the benefit of the Company's stakeholders.\n\nDuring the year, the Board monitored workforce culture and behaviour in a number of ways:\n\n- \u00b7 Regular reviews of whistleblowing reports and actions taken by management in response to issues raised via that medium (see page 84 for a further summary of whistleblower hotline calls during the year).\n- \u00b7 Receiving an update on the Prevention of Harassment programme, in particular the workshops that were held during the year for employees and unionised personnel.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring progress with the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion programme and the development of an online training module on company, with the support of the University of Arizona.",

The Board receives and considers updates on health and safety performance at every Board meeting, in particular information analysing serious injuries and fatalities, Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate, Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate and new cases of occupational disease. These metrics have been used to monitor the health and safety culture.\n- \u00b7 By monitoring updates on the outsourcing reform and progress on the actions that the Company has implemented as a consequence of this reform and assessing the likely impacts on corporate culture which may result from these changes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther information on culture and workforce engagement is set out on pages 82-95.\n\n## Whistleblower hotline\n\nThe whistleblower hotline can be used by anyone who wishes to raise concerns, in confidence, about the Company's operations. The hotline is used by employees, contractors and, occasionally, other stakeholders such as suppliers and local communities. The use of the Company's whistleblower arrangements is monitored quarterly by the Audit Committee (see the Audit Committee report on page 218). The Audit Committee reviews updates on management responses to calls made to the whistleblower line and reports to the Board twice a year on the operation of the whistleblower hotline. The Board received these reports at its\n\nmeetings in April 2023 (in relation to 2H 2022) and July 2023 (in relation to 1H 2023). In 2023, the Audit Committee and Board continued to monitor the reporting of incidences of harassment in line with the anti-harassment protocol.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nThe Executive Committee is responsible for the day-to-day stewardship of all stakeholder relationships and its members report to the Board on the key metrics and initiatives. The Board, either directly or through its Committees, engages or oversees engagement with the Company's stakeholders through a number of governance activities (which are described in more detail, along with further information about the Company's engagement with key stakeholders, in the stakeholder section on pages 30-36).\n\nDuring the year, senior management and the HSECR Committee, on behalf of the Board, evaluated Covid-19 associated engagement strategies. The Company will continue to be cautious in order to safeguard the wellbeing of the workforce and neighbouring communities. More information on engagement with our communities can be found on pages 33 and 139-141.\n\n## Workforce engagement\n\nOur workforce is the foundation that supports our business model. The Board believes that the wellbeing of our people and an ethical and inclusive culture are the drivers of higher levels of employee engagement and are essential to attract and retain talent.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board and its Committees receive information related to the workforce through a range of channels (see workforce engagement diagram), including direct engagement. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has been designated as the Non-executive Director to act as a representative of the workforce in the boardroom. This enables the Board to understand the views of the workforce regarding their experiences of working for the Company as well as providing an additional mechanism to raise concerns.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company undertook a workforce engagement session at the Fresnillo mine that was led by Mr Fern\u00e1ndez. The session enabled Mr Fern\u00e1ndez to listen to the views of employees directly. This session involved representatives from all of the Group's operations, functions and demographics and included unionised and non-unionised workers. The meeting agendas considered relevant workforce issues while remaining open to encourage ideas and concerns being raised.\n\n## The topics covered included:\n\n- \u00b7 Security.\n- \u00b7 Safety in operations.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing line mechanism.\n- \u00b7 Integral wellbeing.\n\nThe openness and candour expressed during this engagement session provided important insights such as: the sense of pride in working for the Company, appreciation of investment in training and professional development, recognition of good job benefits in comparison to our competitors and a recognition of the improvements in corporate communication. Areas of concern included security surrounding our operations, safety incidents and turnover rates, flexible working schedules, salary and wages in the context of inflation.

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nFeedback received from this workforce engagement session was discussed at the October 2023 Board meeting. The insights are hugely valuable for boardroom discussions and decision-making. Feedback was also very useful in informing management programmes and practices. Mr Fern\u00e1ndez has shared with Company management the specific workforce concerns and is following these up to ensure that they are addressed appropriately.\n\n## Investment in the workforce\n\nThe Company invests in its employees through various training and development programmes and healthcare and wellbeing programmes.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFurther details are provided on pages 88-105.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders\n\nThe Board monitors the views of the Company's minority shareholders through reports on investor and analyst communications prepared by the Chief Financial Officer, which are included in the papers for each Board meeting. Such reports identify issues raised by investors during meetings with management during the previous quarter.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer meet with analysts, hold conference calls after quarterly production reports and engage with shareholders by participating in major roadshows in London and other key financial centres, after preliminary and half-yearly results are announced.\n\nThe 2023 AGM was held in person and shareholders were invited to attend. Nevertheless, shareholders were provided with an opportunity to submit questions to the Board via a dedicated email address ahead of the AGM.\n\nThe Head of Investor Relations in London is responsible for maintaining relations with analysts and major shareholders on a day-to-day basis, which is done by way of telephone calls and meetings in London. Contact with investors in Mexico is maintained through the Investor Relations Office in Mexico City. The Senior Independent Director, who is based in London, is available to speak with shareholders concerning specific corporate governance questions as and when they arise.\n\n## The Board and climate\n\nIn relation to climate change and risk, the Board considers climate change during its discussions and when making decisions regarding the Group's strategy, risk management, investments and stakeholders. On behalf of the Board, the HSECR Committee evaluates in greater detail, climate-related performance, risks and opportunities. Since 2020, climate change has been part of the agenda at all HSECR Committee meetings.\n\nThe HSECR Committee reviewed:\n\n- \u00b7 The energy strategy and ambition of the Company's plans, factoring in the expectations of our stakeholders on setting ambitious targets and the current regulatory risks associated with renewable electricity in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The technology strategy to explore opportunities to reduce the carbon emissions and water footprint of mineral processing.\n- \u00b7 The approach of the Company to identify, evaluate and respond to the risks and opportunities of climate change in the business model.\n- \u00b7 The Company's approach to adopt the TCFD recommendations.\n- \u00b7 The safe operation of TSFs.\n- \u00b7 The approach to partner with the scientific community to use climate models to better understand physical risks and socioeconomic scenarios for transition risks.\n\nThe HSECR Committee periodically briefed the Board on climate change performance and the approach of the Company to adopt the TCFD recommendations. During the year the Board was also briefed by the Audit Committee on TCFD disclosure requirements and governance practices.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMore information on this can be found in the Sustainability report on pages 111-128 and in the Audit Committee report on pages 213 and 218.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nThe Group requires that Directors complete a Director's list which sets out details of situations where each Director's interest may conflict with those of the Company (situational conflicts). Each Director re-submitted their Director's list as at 31 December 2023 for the Board to consider and authorise any new situational conflicts identified in the re-submitted lists. In addition, at the beginning of each Board meeting, the Company Secretary reminds the Directors of their duties under sections 175, 177 and 182 of the Companies Act which relate to the disclosure of any conflicts of interest prior to any matter that may be discussed by the Board. Further information about related-party matters considered by the Board during the year are set out in the Audit Committee report on pages 216 and 223-224.\n\n## Relationship Agreement\n\nPe\u00f1oles has entered into a relationship agreement with the Company (the 'Relationship Agreement') to ensure that relationships between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group are conducted at arm's length and on normal commercial terms. Messrs Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, Juan Bordes and Arturo Fernandez have been appointed to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles pursuant to the Relationship Agreement.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement complies with the independence provisions set out in Listing Rule 6.1.4DR for controlled companies. The Independent Non-executive Directors annually review the good standing of the Relationship Agreement (with the most recent review being undertaken in July 2023) and they are satisfied that the Company has complied with the independence provisions included in the Relationship Agreement during the financial year ended 31 December 2023. As far as the Company is aware, such provisions have been complied with during the financial year ended 31 December 2023 by Pe\u00f1oles and/or any of its associates.\n\nPe\u00f1oles has also undertaken not to exercise its voting rights to amend the Articles of Association in a way which would be inconsistent with the provisions of the Relationship Agreement. It has also agreed to abstain from voting on any resolution to approve a 'related-party transaction' (as defined in paragraph 11.1.5 R of the Listing Rules) involving any member of the Pe\u00f1oles Group.\n\n## Director concerns\n\nDirectors have the right to raise concerns at Board meetings and can ask for those concerns to be recorded in the Board minutes. The Board has also established a procedure which enables Directors, in relevant circumstances, to obtain independent professional advice at the Company's expense.",

        "page_content": "## DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## REPORTING ON THE APPLICATION OF THE PRINCIPLE: DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES\n\n## Principle F:\n\nThe Chair leads the board and is responsible for its overall effectiveness in directing the company. They should demonstrate objective judgement throughout their tenure and promote a culture of openness and debate. In addition, the Chair facilitates constructive board relations and the effective contribution of all Non-executive directors, and ensure that directors receive accurate, timely and clear information.\n\nThe outcome of the Board evaluation process, detailed on pages 206-208, confirms that Board members are satisfied with the role that the Chairman takes to meet this principle. The Company Secretary working alongside the Chairman and Executive Management ensures that the Board receives timely and accurate information, and, again, the Board evaluation confirmed the Directors' satisfaction with this service.\n\n## Principle G:\n\nThe board should include an appropriate combination of Executive and Non-executive (and, in particular, Independent Non-executive) directors, such that no one individual or small group of individuals dominates the board's decision-making. There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the board and the executive leadership of the company's business.\n\nThe structure of the Board is described in detail on page 211, and the Board, which is advised by the Nominations Committee, is satisfied that notwithstanding that there are no Executive Directors on the Board, that Principle G is met. As described on pages 204-205 the Nominations Committee has reviewed the independence of all Independent Non-executive Directors and is satisfied that they remain independent in line with the guidance of the Code. As described on pages 204-205 there is a written division of duties between the Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent Director.\n\n## Roles\n\nThe composition of the Board is structured to ensure that no one individual can dominate the decision-making processes of the Board. The Board is led by the Chairman. The Board as a whole currently consists of five non-Independent Non-executive Directors and seven Independent Non-executive Directors. One of the Independent Non-executive Directors is designated as the Senior Independent Director. The Executive Committee provides operational leadership to the Group and is headed by the Chief Executive Officer. The respective responsibilities of the Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and the Senior Independent Director are set down in a written statement which was last updated in October 2019.\n\n## Chairman's independence\n\nMr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res, was appointed as the Chairman of the Company in April 2021, when his father Alberto Baill\u00e8res stepped down from that role. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is beneficially interested in more than 50% of the share capital of the Company through his interest in Industrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V., the Company's controlling shareholder. Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res is the Chairman of Pe\u00f1oles and other companies within the BAL Group, thus at the time of his appointment, he was not independent. With Pe\u00f1oles having a significant stake in the Company, the Board believes that the Chairman's non-independence is not a hindrance for his involvement on the Board but an asset to\n\n## Principle H:\n\nNon-executive directors should have sufficient time to meet their board responsibilities. They should provide constructive challenge, strategic guidance, offer specialist advice and hold management to account.\n\nThe Board has considered potential conflicts of interest of Board members, and is satisfied that they have sufficient time to discharge their duties. The Board evaluation exercise described on pages 206-208, has confirmed that all Directors continue to continue to contribute fully, and provide a robust level of challenge to management. A working meeting of the Board focused on the risk element contained within the proposed strategy, and the Board reviewed and challenged management thoroughly on their proposals.\n\n## Principle I:\n\nThe board, supported by the Company Secretary, should ensure that it has the policies, processes, information, time and resources it needs in order to function effectively and efficiently.\n\nAs described on pages 206-208, the Board evaluation exercise confirmed that all Directors were satisfied with the support they got from the Company Secretary, and that appropriate information was provided to them on a timely basis.\n\nother shareholders especially as related-party transactions are reviewed and approved by Independent Directors and the Audit Committee. The Board, therefore, believes that his involvement is a governance plus since it assures the Chairman's alignment with all shareholders interests. Having served as Deputy Chairman for more than three years and having received guidance from Mr Alberto Baill\u00e8res for many years, the Board considers that Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res possesses significant knowledge and experience of the Company which it believes underpins his effectiveness in carrying out the role of the Chairman. The Board also considers that the continued oversight of the Company's strategic and operational integrity through its membership of the Pe\u00f1oles group enhances the quality of its corporate governance. Given Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' experience and understanding of Mexican business and its regulatory context, this assessment gains further validity in the continuing political and social environment in Mexico. Notwithstanding the expectations of the Code, the Board values and endorses Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' chairmanship of the Company.\n\nThe Relationship Agreement continues to provide a foundation for a transparent governance system, which ensures that the Company benefits from Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res' leadership and experience while being able to demonstrate to other shareholders that the Fresnillo Group is capable of carrying on its business independently of any companies with which he is connected.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#2",

Mr Jacobs and Ms Garza Lag\u00fcera with effect from the May 2024 AGM will cease to be independent Non-executive Directors. The Board, through the Nominations Committee, has assessed each of these Directors by reference to the criteria set out in Provision 10 of the Code and the Board remains satisfied that they are each independent in character and judgement. In making this assessment for Mr Alberto Tiburcio, the Board notes that he was Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mancera S.C., the Mexican firm of EY, the Company's auditors, until June 2013 and that he was not involved in the provision of audit or any other services to the Company by Ernst & Young LLP prior to that date. Mr Tiburcio is an Independent Non-executive Director of Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B. and Grupo Palacio de Hierro, S.A.B. de C.V., which are companies within the BAL Group. He is not involved in executive duties in any of those companies and has a similar obligation to be independent for those two companies as for Fresnillo. The Board does not consider that Mr Tiburcio's position as an Independent Non-executive Director of the Company is adversely impacted by those two appointments. The Board also considers that Mr Tiburcio's experience in Mexican and international business and his experience and knowledge of Mexican and international accounting and audit practice and corporate governance are particularly valuable to the Board and the Audit Committee.\n\n## Senior Independent Director\n\nCharles Jacobs was the Senior Independent Director throughout 2023. He will step down as Senior Independent Director at the 2024 AGM in May. He will be succeeded by Dame Judith Macgregor. In February 2024, Mr Jacobs convened a meeting of the Independent Non-executive Directors to evaluate the performance of the Chairman and to assess the good standing of the Relationship Agreement. The Independent Non-executive Directors were satisfied that there were no issues or concerns in respect of either matter. Mr Jacobs provided feedback to the Chairman on those discussions.\n\n## Time commitment and overboarding\n\nAll Directors pre-clear any proposed appointments to listed company boards with the Chairman, prior to committing to them, and such appointments are ratified by the Board at the next possible meeting. During the 12 months prior to the date of this report Mr Cepeda notified the Board of his appointment as Director of the Board of Directors of RLH Properties, S.A.B. de C.V., a company listed on the Mexican stock exchange (BMV: RLH). No other Directors took on any significant new additional external appointments in the year.\n\nThe Non-executive Directors are required, by their letters of appointment, to spend 14 days per annum on Company business. The Nominations Committee is satisfied that all of the Directors, but particularly the non-Independent Non-executive Directors, spend considerably more than this amount of time on Board and committee activity. In particular, the Board is satisfied that Mr Cepeda is fully available to the Company and has enough time to fulfil his Board commitments to the Company.\n\nThe Nominations Committee annually reviews the time commitments to ensure that all Board members continue to be able to devote sufficient time and attention to the Company's business. Its philosophy in doing so, is to consider the total workload of each Non-executive Director and the particular value that each Director brings to the Board. In making this assessment, the Nominations Committee takes into account the following factors:\n\n- 1. As a single-product Company with operations primarily in just one country, and because of the relative commonality of the Company's activities, the Board does not consider that it needs more than four scheduled Board meetings with additional working meetings per year, a factor which is reflected in the relatively modest fees that the Company pays its Non-executive Directors. Further information regarding fees paid to Nonexecutive Directors can be found on page 230.\n- 2.  This relatively low number of meetings is further justified by the degree of governance oversight of the Company. This comes by virtue of it also being a member of the BAL Group. The calendar for Board and Committee meetings is scheduled to align with the meetings of other companies, including listed companies, within the BAL Group ownership structure. This ensures that Fresnillo plc Directors who are appointed to the boards of other companies within the BAL Group do not have any time conflicts with their other commitments on BAL Listed Entity boards.\n\nThe other listed Company directorships of the Fresnillo plc Directors are set out on pages 194-197 of this report. The Board and Committee attendance record of each of the Directors during 2023 is set out on page 192 of this report.\n\n## Company Secretary\n\nThe advice and services of the Company Secretary (whose appointment and removal are matters reserved for the Board) are also available to the Directors. The Board also regularly receives advice on UK corporate governance and legal developments from its UK legal and corporate governance advisors.",

Both appointments and succession plans should be based on merit and objective criteria and, within this context, should promote diversity of gender, social and ethnic backgrounds, cognitive and personal strengths.\n\nThe Board is satisfied it has applied principle J. An explanation of the Board appointment and succession planning activities can be found on pages 209-211. The Company's policy on Board diversity is on set out on page 209 and details of the gender balance of senior management and the Company's approach to diversity, equity and inclusion is set out on page 209-210.\n\n## Performance evaluation\n\n## Board effectiveness review\n\nThe Board conducts an annual review of the effectiveness of the performance of the Board and its Committees. A combination of externally-facilitated and internally-run evaluations is carried out over a three-year cycle and forms the Board Development Programme. The Board recognises that a continuous and constructive review of its performance is an important factor in achieving its objectives and realising its full potential.\n\nThe cycle of the Board's evaluations is summarised as follows:\n\n## Year 1\n\nExternally-facilitated Board evaluation using questionnaires and interviews.\n\n## Year 2\n\nFollow-up on action plan prepared in response to Year 1 evaluation using internally-facilitated questionnaires.\n\n## Year 3\n\nFocus on outstanding and emerging issues arising from the action plan using internally-facilitated questionnaires.\n\nIn 2023, Lintstock LLP were invited to undertake effectiveness reviews of the Board and the principal Committees of the Board. The reviews consisted of a combination of survey questionnaires and one-to-one interviews.\n\n## Principle K:\n\nThe board and its committees should have a combination of skills, experience and knowledge. Consideration should be given to the length of service of the board as a whole and membership regularly refreshed.\n\nBiographies of the Directors can be found on pages 194-197 and demonstrate a wide area of expertise relevant to both the business and areas of operation. This is augmented by Directors who have significant commercial and other relevant expertise. The length of service of Board members is detailed on page 210.\n\n## Principle L:\n\nAnnual evaluation of the board should consider its composition, diversity and how effectively members work together to achieve objectives. Individual evaluation should demonstrate whether each director continues to contribute effectively.\n\nFull details of the Board evaluation process and disclosure of the outcome is shown on pages 206-208.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#3",

In addition, there is a regular distribution of industry briefings on technical, market and sector issues.\n\nDirectors are encouraged to visit the Company's mines to familiarise themselves with the Fresnillo Group's operations, to meet staff and visit community projects supported by the Group.\n\nBriefings by the Company's legal advisers are arranged for all new Directors.

It has enabled the Committee to undertake a detailed search for suitable replacements, a task that presented challenges during 2022, due to the prevalent pandemic at that time. The Nominations Committee has been fully-focused on the task of identifying suitable nominees as independent Non-executive Directors and proposing them by the 2024 AGM. Therefore, two new Directors will be replacing Mr Jacobs and Ms B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera as independent Non-executive Directors. More detail on the search process is given on page 211.\n\nIn addition, during 2023 the Committee also reviewed the recruitment processes to separate the Chief Operating role by appointing a Chief Operating Officer for the Northern Region.\n\n## Board diversity policy progress\n\nWe continue to recognise and embrace the benefits of having a diverse Board, particularly the value that different perspectives and experience bring to the quality of Board debate and decisionmaking. We hold fast to the importance of making Board appointments on the basis of merit; but we also take seriously considerations such as background and experience, age, gender and shareholder perspectives in our reviews of the composition of the Board. We believe that setting targets for the number of people from a particular background or gender is not an effective approach and therefore we have no specific quotas or targets. Nevertheless, our direction of travel, as far as diversity is concerned, has been a progressive one. Our Board composition meets the target set by the Hampton-Alexander Review since at least 33% of our Board is comprised by female Directors. The Committee has considered the new Listing Rule requirement that: (i) this percentage should be 40%; and (ii) at least one senior Board post should held by a female appointee, and recommended to the Board that two new female Independent Non-executive Directors be appointed, and that Dame Judith Macgregor be appointed as Senior Independent Director with effect from the conclusion of the 2024 AGM. I am delighted that the Board has agreed with these recommendations.\n\nSince February 2020, the Board has benefited from seven Independent Non-executive Directors out of 12, the largest number of Independent Directors the Company has ever had on the Board. This adds diversity of thought and input into our Board discussions.\n\nIt is pleasing to also note that in 2023 the Parker Review reported that Fresnillo plc has met its set ethnicity target for FTSE 100 companies. Since our IPO in 2008, the Board has consisted predominantly of Mexican Directors, alongside at least two British Directors, which enables the Board to benefit from a sound understanding of both the UK and Mexican cultural contexts of the Company in its decision-making.",

        "page_content": "## NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\n## Company-wide gender diversity\n\nIn April 2020 the Board approved the Company's adoption of the CLIMB framework (developed by McKinsey) which has been a useful tool to categorise the Company's current or planned initiatives on diversity. In April 2023, it was presented to the Board an update on the diversity programme that was implemented in 2020. The strategy includes several initiatives designed to: improve the leadership opportunities for women in the Company; develop a better human resources infrastructure; adopt and use metrics to improve management; and monitor and promote the right culture and behaviours.\n\nThe goal of this strategy is still to enhance the contribution of women to the success of Fresnillo whilst having a positive impact on the women that the Company employs. This is strategically important as well as being fair because it would enhance innovation, stakeholder engagement and risk management as experienced in Board composition and diversity. Further information on the implementation of this programme is set out on pages 96-97 in the Sustainability report.\n\n## Board evaluation\n\nIn 2023, the Board engaged Lintstock LLP to undertake an externally-facilitated review of the effectiveness of the Board, the Board Committees and the contributions of individual Directors, the results of which were collated by Lintstock into a Board discussion document. A summary of the overall approach adopted and findings arising from this review is set out on pages 206-208 of the Corporate Governance report. We were pleased that the overall conclusion from the reviews was that the performance of the Fresnillo Board of Directors and, indeed, the Nominations Committee, both continue to be rated very highly.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Mr Alejandro Baill\u00e8res\n\nChairman of the Nominations Committee\n\n## Role\n\nThe Nominations Committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the structure, size and composition of the Board and its Committees and succession planning for the Directors and other senior executives. Before making appointments of new Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Nominations Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience on the Board and identifying and nominating suitable candidates for approval by the Board. Prior to making such recommendations, the Nominations Committee considers the other time commitments and significant external interests of such candidates to ensure that they are able to contribute effectively to the Board.\n\nThe Nominations Committee has recommended Board Appointments and Diversity policies which provide the framework for the Nominations Committee and the Board's approach to Board appointments. The Board has also approved a Group Diversity policy. (Full versions of these policies may be found on the Company's website - www.fresnilloplc.com). A further explanation of the steps that the Company is taking to promote diversity across its businesses is set out in the Sustainability report on pages 96-97.\n\n## Board appointments policy\n\nThe Nominations Committee and Board are strongly committed to the principle of equality of opportunity when making new appointments to the Board while ensuring that appointments are based on merit. The Nominations Committee continues to consider the composition of the Board with this commitment in mind.\n\nThe criteria for determining the composition of the Board and future Board appointments continue to be based on:\n\n- \u00b7 Relationship Agreement requirements and guidelines for appointments to the Board by Pe\u00f1oles.\n- \u00b7 The Company's leading position as a precious metals miner in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 The Company's inclusion in the FTSE 100 Index.\n- \u00b7 The specific functions on Board committees which independent Directors will be required to fulfil.\n- \u00b7 The provisions set out in the current terms of reference of the Nominations Committee and the Board Diversity policy.\n\n## Directors' length of tenure\n\n| As at 31 December 2023    |   0 to 3  years | 3 to 6  years   | 6 to 9  years   |   Over 9  years |\n|---------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Independent Directors     |               1 | 2               | 2               |               2 |\n| Non-independent Directors |               1 | -               | -               |               4 |\n\nThe Nominations Committee has not previously used open advertising or retain any external consultants when making new appointments to the Board as it is not considered necessary considering the Company's contacts within Mexico and further afield.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Executive succession planning\n\nIn April 2023, in line with its usual practice, the Nominations Committee reviewed a schedule of possible successors for all the positions on the Executive Committee (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Vice President of Exploration and Chief Operating Officer). This review considered both short-term emergency and long-term planning scenarios.\n\nThe Company is committed to creating long-term value by maximising the potential of its operations and delivering profitable growth, whilst ensuring the wellbeing of its stakeholders. To further strengthen the oversight of its assets and focus on the advancement of its pipeline, with effect from 1 December 2023, the Company announced the creation of new executive roles for its operations and projects: Chief Operating Officer North and Chief Operating Officer Central. More detail on the search process is given on page 209.\n\nIn 2024 the schedule of possible successors will be reviewed taking into consideration the split of the COO role into two roles.\n\n## Non-executive Directors succession planning\n\nAs advised to shareholders last year, Mr Charles Jacobs and Mrs B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera were proposed to shareholders for reelection at the AGM in 2023, despite the fact that they had been on the Board for more than nine years. The Board considered that they both remained fully independent, and shareholders approved their re-appointment for a further one year. During the year the Nominations Committee was fully focused on the task of identifying suitable nominees as independent Non-executive Directors and proposing them by the 2024 AGM. This year the Nominations Committee had the support of an external search consultancy which assisted the Committee in identifying suitable candidates. The search focused mainly on Mexico and the UK.\n\n## Board skills and experience\n\nThe Committee recommended to the Board that Ms Luz Adriana Ram\u00edrez and Ms Rosa V\u00e1zquez be appointed at the forthcoming AGM as Independent Non-executive Directors in place of Mr Charles Jacobs and Mrs B\u00e1rbara Garza Lag\u00fcera. Ms Ram\u00edrez is a dynamic senior executive who has had a successful career across multiple industries. She is a strong leader, motivating teams to deliver on strategy and objectives. Ms V\u00e1zquez is a strong people leader with a track record of developing talent, motivating teams, and driving engagement and will bring the experience and technical knowledge to add value to the Board, particularly an orientation to best practices and governance.\n\n## Other Committee activity during 2023\n\nThe Nominations Committee also considered the following matters as part of its usual programme of activity:\n\n- \u00b7 Time commitment: A review of the time commitment required from each Director and their other external appointments, prior to making a recommendation to the Board supporting that all of the continuing Directors be proposed for re-election at the 2024 AGM. (Further analysis of the Nominations Committee's assessment is set out on pages 206-208).\n- \u00b7 Committee report: Approval of the 2022 Nominations Committee report prior to publication.\n- \u00b7 Committee evaluation: In February 2024, the Nominations Committee reviewed the outcome of the independent performance evaluation undertaken in 2023, which concluded that the Committee is performing very well.\n\n| Skill/Experience                                                                                                                                                                                       |   Description | % of Board  members                         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| Sustainable commercial success in business at a senior executive level.                                                                                                                                |            83 | Commercial   leadership                     |\n| Experience in enterprise-wide strategy development and implementation in industries with long  cycles and developing and leading business transformation strategies.                                   |            83 | Strategy                                    |\n| Relevant experience and understanding of the Mexican political, cultural, regulatory and business  environments.                                                                                       |            92 | Mexican business  experience                |\n| Extensive direct experience in environments requiring capital allocation, cost-efficiency and cash  flow management disciplines, with proven long-term performance.                                    |            92 | Capital allocation   and cost-efficiency    |\n| Extensive experience with complex workplace health, safety, environmental and community risks,  frameworks and issues.                                                                                 |            75 | Health, safety,  environment and  community |\n| Relevant experience and understanding of capital markets, institutional investor engagement and  regulatory/governance expectations.                                                                   |            83 | Capital markets                             |\n| Board-level experience and/or long-term knowledge gained through working with companies  operating in the mining or natural resources sector.                                                          |            67 | Mining and natural  resources               |\n| Relevant experience in financial regulation and the capability to evaluate financial statements,  financial controls and risk.                                                                         |            75 | Financial expertise                         |\n| Extensive experience of public policy or regulatory matters, including fiscal and economic, ESG (in  particular climate change) and community issues, social responsibility and transformation issues. |            67 | Public policy expertise                     |\n| Workforce learning and skills development, diversity and wellbeing.                                                                                                                                    |            92 | Workforce wellbeing                         |",

The Board has a formal non-audit services policy which is included in the Company's terms of engagement with the external auditor. The Head of internal audit reports to the Audit Committee Chair and the Committee undertakes an annual evaluation of the effectiveness of internal audit. The Audit Committee undertook a detailed review of the integrity of the financial and narrative statements and was able to advise the Board in accordance with DTR 7.1.3 (5) that the Board could approve them.\n\n## Principle O:\n\nThe board should establish procedures to manage risk, oversee the internal control framework, and determine the nature and extent of the principal risks the company is willing to take in order to achieve its longterm strategic objectives.\n\nA description of the Group's risk framework can be found on pages 151-155, and the role of the Audit Committee in monitoring the risk matrix is described on page 221.

Movements in the exchange rate between the Mexican peso and the US dollar in the year, made more difficult the economic environment for the Company. Companies have needed to respond proactively to the challenges presented.\n\nThe Committee has continued to focus closely on key financial processes, material risks and internal control. Further close attention has been given to the key areas of judgement and estimation in the financial statements. With the support of Internal Audit, Internal Control and Risk Management, the Committee concluded that the internal controls and processes were functioning appropriately, and no significant weaknesses have been identified. Close consultation and interaction by the Committee with the external auditor has also been maintained during the year. The Committee has also continued to consider the impact on the Company of changes arising from the new Mexican Mining Law.\n\nThe items of particular focus for the Committee during the year are detailed below:\n\n- \u00b7 Proposed changes to regulations : The Committee has continued to monitor proposed changes to the Corporate governance regime required to be in place for Companies listed on the London Stock Exchange. Although there is renewed uncertainty as to the ultimate form and extent of the proposed changes and many of those will no longer be required to be in force for 2024, the Committee has continued to ensure that the Company can respond appropriately when needed and implement those proposed changes that merit early adoption.\n- \u00b7 Tax contingencies : The Committee has continued to closely monitor tax contingencies, in particular the differences generated from prior years regarding payments related to the Silverstream contract, which are considered by the Company for tax purposes as a financial derivative transaction and are being challenged by the Servicio de Administration Tributaria (SAT), the Mexican Tax Authority. During 2023, the Committee has received regular reports from management on their discussions with the SAT, concerning this matter.\n- \u00b7 Climate-related financial disclosures : This annual report includes disclosures consistent with the guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). These disclosure requirements were discussed by the Committee and were the subject of particular attention while reviewing the annual report and the financial statements. The Committee has also considered the role of the HSECR Committee in monitoring climate-related risks, the mitigating actions being taken to manage those risks, as well as its own responsibility to ensure that accurate reporting is achieved and published. The Committee is satisfied that the disclosures reflect the Company's current position and is aware of the further progress that the Company needs to make in this area in order to comply with the TCFD recommendations. Further details of the progress made during the year and actions expected to be taken during 2024 are set out in the letter from the Chairman of the HSECR Committee on pages 76-77 and in the Sustainability report on pages 111-128.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\n- \u00b7 Reserves and resources : The Committee has been pleased to see an improvement in the timing of the delivery of the Reserves and Resources Statement by independent reserves auditors. The Company has continued to make progress in addressing the observations from prior years with the result that the Company was able to report its reserves and resources much timelier than in the past, allowing additional time for consideration of the potential accounting impacts and therefore preparation of the annual financial information.\n- \u00b7 Anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) : During the year, the Committee has continued to closely monitor management's plan to implement the recommendations proposed following the externally-facilitated ISO 37001 audit carried out in 2022 to assess the conformity of the Company's ABAC programme with ISO standards (in line with the UK Ministry of Justice Guidance). The Committee was kept informed of progress made on plan implementation. Further information about the Company's approach to bribery and corruption is set out on pages 85-86 of the Strategic report.\n- \u00b7 Cybersecurity : IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operation Technology) security and data protection were also regularly reviewed by the Committee during the year to ensure that the need for improvements identified in previous years continue to be implemented on schedule. In 2023, the Committee continued to receive an update on the Group's IT strategy, and its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy, as well as the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo Management Teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on pages 86 and 171 of the Strategic report. The Company continues to make progress in this important area, and this will be monitored further by the Committee during 2024.\n- \u00b7 Fraud detection : In response to the expected future regulatory changes, the Company has continued its efforts to strengthen its firm commitment to preventing and detecting fraud by enhancing its fraud risk assessment process, reinforcing the controls currently in place to prevent and detect material fraud. The Committee has been working closely with Internal Control, Risk Management and the internal audit teams on this area. The Internal Control area has been receiving feedback from its external auditors, as a result of this it was concluded that the Company's Fraud Risks assessment comply with the standards and requirement demanded by the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE). More information on risk management systems can be found on pages 151-155.\n- \u00b7 Soledad-Dipolos assets : During 2023 the Company recognised a write-off of US$21.9 million over the assets related to SoledadDipolos. This represents the estimated loss of inventory resulting from certain illegal mining activity in the leaching pads located along the portion of land owned by the Company but to which the Company does not have access. The Committee, based on the work performed by the Company and reviewed by external auditors, concluded that the write-off was reasonable. In addition, despite the fact that the Company has not had access since 2013 to a separate portion of land where property, plant, equipment and inventories are located, based on evidence presented to the Committee and discussions held with management and the external auditors, it was considered appropriate to continue recognising such assets in the balance sheet for a total amount of approximately US$106 million. The Company is confident that it will regain access to the SoledadDipolos assets. The Committee will continue monitoring the development on this matter in 2024.\n\nIn July 2023, a working session of the Board considered in detail the strategic issues of the Company's operations that the Board faced. Included in this discussion was consideration of ESG issues, including the emerging risks, and how the Company is continuing to prepare to deal with them.\n\nIn the second half of the year, an evaluation of the performance of the Board and its committees was carried out. With respect to the Audit Committee, I am pleased to report that the results of the evaluation were very positive. Nevertheless, we continue to look for ways to improve the efficiency of the meetings making sure that we remain well-briefed on the subjects of interest to the Committee.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Committee undertook a questionnairebased evaluation of the performance of the internal audit function and was satisfied with the outcome.\n\nIn closing, I would like to acknowledge the effort and valuable contributions made by the members of the Committee, and by the Company executives who work closely with it; as well as the invaluable support and trust that the Committee continues to receive from the Board.\n\nI would be happy to speak with any shareholders who have questions about the work of the Committee.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nChairman of the Audit Committee",

The Committee met five times during 2023 and once more in February 2024 with all the meetings being either hybrid or virtual via video conference. Notwithstanding this, the Committee was able to operate in accordance with its terms of reference and it was able to follow its usual pattern of work which is reported under the following headings:\n\n## Reporting\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- \u00b7 Financial reporting : Overseeing the Company's financial and narrative reporting to shareholders (including considering whether it was fair, balanced and understandable).\n- \u00b7 Stakeholder relationships and reporting : Overseeing the Company's reporting on certain stakeholder issues.\n- \u00b7 Whistleblowing : Overseeing on behalf of the Board, the cases reported through the whistleblower line and the work of the Honour Commission.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Details of the membership of the Committee and the Committee's effectiveness review are set out on pages 193 and 207 respectively of the Governance section.\n\n## Reporting\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nThe Company reports to shareholders on its financial performance twice a year.\n\nThe principal steps taken by the Committee during the period from 1 January 2023 to the date of this report in relation to its review of the published financial statements were:\n\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and annual report for the year ending 31 December 2022 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents.\n- \u00b7 Review of the 2023 interim financial statements and 2023 interim announcement and consideration of EY's comments on the drafts of these documents.\n- \u00b7 Review of plan for preparing the financial statements and annual report for the year ending 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 Review of the significant judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements (see below).\n- \u00b7 Review of the financial statements and annual report for the year ending 31 December 2023 and consideration of EY's comments on these documents.\n\nTo aid the Committee members' understanding of the reported financial results during the year, the Chief Financial Officer updated the Committee on the Group's financial performance at each of its meetings in February, April, July, October and December.\n\n## Significant judgement areas\n\nThe Committee considered the principal areas of financial statement risk and judgements made in relation to both the interim and full-year financial statements, prior to recommending those financial statements to the Board for approval. In many cases, these significant judgement areas were the same as those considered in previous years; however, as the mining cycle progresses these areas of judgement or estimation evolve, and new ones may need to be considered while others may become less important.\n\n## Assurance\n\n- \u00b7 External audit : Overseeing the work of and the Company's relationship with the external auditor.\n- \u00b7 Internal audit : Overseeing the work and findings of internal audit.\n\n## Risk and controls\n\n- \u00b7 Risk : Overseeing the operation of the Company's risk management framework.\n- \u00b7 Internal control : Monitoring the Company's internal control environment.\n- \u00b7 Related parties : Overseeing the financial aspects of the Company's commercial relationships with related parties.\n\n<!-- image -->",

In each case, the Audit Committee concluded that the accounting treatment and disclosure in the financial statements are appropriate.\n\n## Related-party transactions including revenue recognition (see note 27 to the financial statements)\n\n## Assessment of risk:\n\nVariables considered:\n\nSources of assurance:\n\nFresnillo has a controlling shareholder and as a result has very strong ties both to Pe\u00f1oles and the broader BAL group. There is a risk that related-party relationships could be taken advantage of to manipulate earnings, otherwise distort the Company's financial position and/or transfer value to Pe\u00f1oles or another BAL company inappropriately. Furthermore, related-party transaction disclosure requirements allow investors to understand the nature and extent of the Company's transactions with related parties and there is a risk that disclosures in the financial statements could be inaccurate or incomplete.\n\nEvery year, the Committee scrutinises the probity of all major related-party transactions to ensure that they are entered into transparently and fairly to all shareholders. The Committee continued reviewing the implementation of the Baluarte Minero reorganisation, which started in 2021 (see the section of this report headed 'Related parties' on page 223), and the outcome continues to be evaluated.\n\nThe Committee considered management reports on the transactions with related parties during the year. In particular, it received confirmation from the Chief Executive Officer on the trading relationship with Met-Mex and the basis on which pricing is determined (using a methodology which was adopted in 2019) (see the 'Related parties' section on page 223.\n\nThe Committee discussed EY's procedures to ensure that related-party transactions are recognised accurately and correctly reported in the relevant disclosures in the annual report, as well as their related conclusions.\n\nInternal audit routinely review agreements between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles, the results of which are reported to the Committee as part of its annual Internal Audit programme updates. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC) conducts annual reviews of the intercompany transactions each year (including related-party transactions). In previous years, these reviews have not resulted in any adverse comments thus providing a basis of assurance for the usual approach; however, the PWC 2023 transfer pricing review will not be completed until after the date of approval of this report.\n\n## Silverstream contract (see note 14 to the financial statements)\n\n| Assessment of risk:    | The Silverstream contract represents a large asset on the balance sheet which can, as a result of movements in  variables discussed below, give rise to significant albeit non-cash, movements in the income statement.                                                                                                          |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variables  considered: | The Silverstream contract is a derivative financial instrument which must be reflected at fair value at each  balance sheet date. The fair value is most sensitive to the timing and volume of forecast production derived                                                                                                       |\n| Sources of  assurance: | The Committee discussed with management and EY the inputs into the valuation at the balance sheet  date and associated sensitivity analysis. It also reviewed management's suggested disclosures relating to the  Silverstream contract. It discussed with EY their procedures and conclusions for their audit of the valuation. |",

Other key variables considered include the expected  metals prices, costs and discount rates. The estimated valuation of the recoverable amount of long-term  mining assets will change year-on-year in response to changes in these inputs. If the financial statements are  not adjusted accordingly there is a risk of significant financial misstatement.                                                                                                                                                             |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Variables  considered:                                     | The estimation of reserves and resources, prices, costs, discount rates and related mine plans for each business  unit, along with management's assessment of impairment indicators were considered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| Sources of  assurance:                                     | The Committee noted that the specialist third-party reports on management's estimates of reserves and  resources and management's estimates of recoverable value had been prepared and then reviewed by EY,  using specialists where necessary. The Committee also noted the reports from SRK and AMC on reserves and  resources and scrutinised the process by which they were prepared to ensure that improvements made during  the year had been properly implemented. Internal audit also followed up on steps taken by management  during the year. The Committee further evaluated EY's assessment of management's position on the mines  most at risk and sensitivities performed by EY for alternative metals price and discount rate scenarios.                                               |\n| Mineral reserves and resources (see pages 336-341)         | Mineral reserves and resources (see pages 336-341)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| Assessment of the  risk:                                   | Reserves and resources are a primary driver of Fresnillo's market valuation and a significant input into  calculations of depreciation and assessments of impairment. Such calculations are dependent on significant  amounts of geological data provided by the Company's business units. There were significant improvements  in the timing of the delivery of the Reserves and Resources Statement by independent reserves auditors. The  Company has continued to make progress in addressing the observations from prior years with the result  that the Company was able to report its reserves and resources much more timely than in the past, allowing  additional time for consideration of the potential accounting impacts and therefore preparation of the annual  financial information. |\n| Variables  considered:                                     | The estimation of mineral reserves and resources requires significant judgement, not only in respect of  mineral physically in place but also metal price and cost assumptions used to determine the cut-off grade for  identifying economically-viable ore bodies. There is also judgement in developing and maintaining the mine  plans which estimate the timing and quantities of related production.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Sources of  assurance:                                     | During 2023, the Committee continued monitoring the process and have observed improvements to align  more closely to International Practices, for example: the adoption of a new ore body modelling method (OSM),  enhancement of a cost model and geotechnical model. The SRK and AMC reports were again delivered on  time at the end of the year which allowed a robust analysis to be considered by the Committee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Taxation and PTU (see note 11 to the financial statements) | Taxation and PTU (see note 11 to the financial statements)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Assessment   of risk:                                      | The taxation of mining companies in Mexico has been the subject of much attention as reflected by a number  of tax inspections that are ongoing or have been initiated by the tax authorities.

Reviews of tax related matters were also undertaken by internal audit. The Committee reviewed management's supporting memoranda on the consolidation of tax and PTU and sought EY's views on the same. It ascertained the degree to which judgements and adjustments are supported by internal and/or external subject matter experts and ensured that they corresponded with information presented during the year prior to approving the relevant disclosures in the annual report.\n\n## Ensuring that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable\n\nThe Committee supports the Board in ensuring that the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable. The approach taken by the Board in relation to the annual report and financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 is described on page 224 of the Corporate Governance report. Different sections of the report were circulated to Board members during early February 2024 to provide time for comments to be passed back to management. In addition, internal audit undertook a review of the non-financial reporting (which is extracted from the Company's operational records). In support of this process, prior to deciding whether to recommend them to the Board for approval, the Committee also:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewed the annual report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and comments discussed with management.\n- \u00b7 Reviewed with management the different disclosures relating to climate change throughout the annual report and, in particular, the TCFD reporting, including the statement of compliance.\n- \u00b7 Discussed the annual report and financial reporting with the Company's Chief Financial Officer.\n- \u00b7 Discussed with internal audit points arising from their review of the principal non-financial numbers in the annual report.\n\n## Stakeholder reporting\n\nThe Committee plays a role in overseeing, on behalf of the Board, some key aspects of the Company's reporting concerning its relationships with key stakeholder groups.\n\nEmployees : The Committee reviewed the work of the Honour Commission in relation to matters raised via the whistleblower line (see following section).\n\nGovernment/Tax authorities : The Committee closely monitors the Company's relationship with the SAT, with the status of any outstanding tax audits reviewed at most meetings. The Committee receives regular reports from the Head of Tax on her interactions with the SAT concerning current tax audits.\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee reviewed the Company's Payments to Governments data, published in June; and the Company's UK Tax Strategy Statement, published in November.\n\nEnvironment/Climate : During the year, the Committee continued evaluating the role that it should play in overseeing the governance of climate change and environmental risks. In particular, it was agreed that the Committee should work closely with the HSECR Committee to ensure that the governance of climate-related risks and monitoring of KPIs associated with climate-related risks is aligned between Fresnillo's operations and financial reporting.\n\n## Whistleblowing\n\nThe 'L\u00ednea Correcta' whistleblower hotline allows stakeholders to anonymously report (via an independent third party) violations of the Group's Code of Conduct. The hotline is available for all stakeholders, including employees and third parties, so that any concerns about misconduct or impropriety may be raised and dealt with appropriately. All matters raised via the hotline are processed by an independent third party for review by the Honour Commission (which comprises the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer North, the Chief Operating Officer Central, the Compliance Officer, the Vice President of Exploration and the Head of Legal). A summary of the whistleblowing cases, which also includes the decisions of the Honour Commission in relation to each case, is reviewed by the Committee twice a year (February and July meetings) and the Chairman of the Committee gives a report to the Board every six months on the key trends and steps taken as a result of these reviews. Changes to the format of reporting to the Committee and the Board during the year have enabled the Board and Committee to better evaluate the reasons for the incidents reported, although the trends remain consistent year-on-year.\n\nIn 2023, there were a total of 163 reports (compared to 113 in 2022). In 2023, 158 (96%) of the reports were concluded in the year with the remainder, having been raised in the latter part of the year, still under investigation. Further details about the whistleblowing reports in 2023 is set out in the Sustainability report on page 84. During the year, the Committee was satisfied that all matters had been or continue to be properly investigated with appropriate action taken.",

EY was originally appointed in 2008 and their appointment was reconfirmed in 2016 following a rigorous external audit tender process in 2015-2016. The next tender process is currently expected to be held in 2025. The current lead partner, Steve Dobson, has been in place since 2020. During 2023, the members of the Committee met twice with representatives from EY without management present and once with management without representatives of EY present, to ensure that there are no issues in the relationship between management and the external auditor which it should address. There were none noted as a result of such discussions.\n\nThe Company was in compliance with the Statutory Audit Services for Large Companies Market Investigation (Mandatory Use of Competitive Processes and Audit Committee Responsibilities) Order 2014 during the year.\n\n## External audit process\n\nThe key steps in the Committee's interactions with EY during the period from 1 January 2023 to the date of this report were:\n\n- \u00b7 The review of a report from EY providing their observations arising from the 2022 audit process and management responses to those observations in April 2023.\n- \u00b7 Discussion with EY of the findings from their review of the interim results for the period ended 30 June 2023.\n- \u00b7 The review of the 2023 half-year representation letter given to EY.\n- \u00b7 The review and approval of the external audit plan, fees and terms of audit engagement.\n- \u00b7 The review of the results of the 'hard close audit' for the ten months to 31 October 2023.\n- \u00b7 The review of the representation letter given to EY for the 2023 full-year audit.\n- \u00b7 The review of EY's report following completion of the audit for the year ended 31 December 2023.\n\nQuality, objectiveness and independence of the external auditor : The Committee is mindful of its responsibility to ensure that the external auditor maintains its independence and objectivity and is appropriately qualified with sufficient resources and expertise to fulfil the role. The Committee specifically reviewed, and is satisfied with, the independence of EY as the external auditor based on disclosures provided by EY in accordance with UK Ethical Standards for the audit profession. The Committee discussed the quality, objectiveness and independence of the EY team with the Management Team and was satisfied that there were no concerns in this regard.\n\nNon-audit services policy : The Committee has adopted a policy for the provision of non-audit services to the Fresnillo Group by the external auditor (the 'Policy'). The Committee has maintained an ongoing dialogue with EY during the year concerning the services that it provides to the Company and the wider Pe\u00f1oles Group to ensure that where such services are provided, they are in line with the Policy or discussed with the Committee on a timely basis.\n\nThe current Policy permits the engagement of the external auditor to provide a narrow range of permitted services which are closely related to the audit and/or required by law or regulation. Any engagement of the external auditor to provide permitted services above US$5,000 is subject to the specific approval of the Committee. During 2023, EY provided audit-related assurance services in connection with the review of the interim financial statements (US$568,000) including the climate-related non-audit service and tax opinion. The ratio of fees paid for non-audit work in relation to audit work during the year was 0.34:1.00 (2022: 0.26:1.00).\n\nDetails of the fees paid to EY during the year are shown in note 28 to the financial statements.\n\n## Evaluation of the effectiveness of the external audit and the auditor\n\nThe Committee assesses the effectiveness of EY as its external auditor from two perspectives:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviews of the work of EY's UK practice, as a firm, undertaken by the Financial Reporting Council's Audit Quality Review Team.\n- \u00b7 Its own assessment of the effectiveness of the external audit process and the role played by both EY's UK and Mexican teams in the performance of the annual audit.\n\nAudit quality review : The Committee reviewed the report of the FRC on its Audit Quality Review on EY as a firm and discussed with the EY Audit Partner whether any of the FRC's findings were relevant to the firm's audit of the Fresnillo financial statements. The conclusion from this review was that there were no major matters of concern to consider.\n\nAudit Committee assessment of EY : Following the completion of the 2023 annual report, the Committee undertook a review of the performance and effectiveness of EY at its April 2023 meeting. As part of this process, the Chief Financial Officer and Finance Team were invited to provide their insights into their interaction with the EY teams during that process. The Committee concluded that EY was performing well with an overall consensus being that the working relationship was good.\n\nGovernance\n\n<!-- image -->",

The re-appointment of the auditor will be made subject to a review of proposed fees for the 2024 audit in July 2024.\n\n## Internal audit\n\nThe 2023 Internal Audit annual plan was approved by the Audit Committee in October 2022, incorporating audits across all of Fresnillo's business units with a focus on strategic priorities and key risks. Internal audit continued to deploy technology and apply data analytics to achieve a satisfactory depth of audit coverage and gain deeper insights into Fresnillo's risk and control profile. Internal audit completed a number of risk reviews along with process and controls assessments focusing on efficiency, productivity, cost management and regulatory compliance. Also, as every year, internal audit verified the validity, accuracy and completeness of the nonfinancial information included in the 2023 annual report and reported the results to the Audit Committee at the beginning of 2024.\n\nDue to the continued importance of cybersecurity and the evolving technology landscape, internal audit continue assessing aimed at validating the design and effectiveness of Fresnillo's cybersecurity, IT (Information Technology) and OT (Operational Technology) processes and controls. The Audit Committee continues to review progress made in raising the level of cybersecurity maturity and actions taken by management to ensure compliance with laws and regulations.\n\nTowards the end of each year, internal audit presents the proposed annual internal audit plan and resourcing requirements for the following year. The 2024 internal audit plan was presented to the Committee and approved in October 2023. The plan was developed according to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing, and considered the following:\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nshutterstock\\_736197394\n\nshutterstock\\_1025305825\n\nshutterstock\\_1705437412\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nshutterstock\\_736197394\n\nshutterstock\\_1025305825\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\nshutterstock\\_1705437412\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nshutterstock\\_736197394\n\nshutterstock\\_1025305825\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\nshutterstock\\_1705437412\n\nshutterstock\\_439569301\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshutterstock\\_411624148\n\nshutterstock\\_736197394\n\nshutterstock\\_1635254404\n\nshutterstock\\_1705437412\n\nSince 2022, the internal audit plan includes planned audits relating to strategic priorities and higher-risk areas such as exploration, ongoing capital projects, compliance with laws and regulations (e.g. environmental laws, labour law, permitting requirements), reserves and resources procedures, Tailings Dam management, health and safety, taxes, cybersecurity and IT-OT processes and multi-risk operational compliance processes at mines.\n\nThe Head of internal audit attended all Audit Committee meetings throughout the year. Members of the Audit Committee meet with the Head of internal audit twice a year without management present.\n\nAt each meeting during the year, the Audit Committee also monitored the progress made by management in addressing 'red flag' items (i.e. relevant control observations) identified through internal audit work. The Audit Committee's focus is to ensure that the management responses to remediation are appropriate, and that timely progress is made in reducing the number of red flags over time.\n\nIn addition, the Audit Committee monitored the quality of the dialogue between internal audit and the Executive Committee in reviewing internal audit findings and agreeing action plans with appropriate levels of operational buy-in to address the points raised. The Audit Committee met with the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer (before the role split) several times during the year to review the outstanding internal audit points and is satisfied with the progress achieved through this dialogue.\n\nAt the end of the year, the Audit Committee carried out an evaluation of the performance of the internal audit function, based on a focused questionnaire, and was satisfied with the outcome.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\n## Risk and Controls\n\n## Risk\n\nThe Committee monitors how the Company's risk management framework is operating. Operational responsibility for risk lies with line management (details of the risk management system are set out on pages 151-155). The Audit Committee discusses potential changes to the Group's risk profile through its regular reviews of the Risk Matrix and its consideration of any associated recommendations from management proposing changes to the Risk Matrix to take account of changing and emerging risk. The Company defines emerging risk as: ' A new manifestation of risk that cannot yet be fully assessed, risks that are known to some degree but are not likely to materialise or have an impact for several years or a risk that the Company is not aware of but that could, due to emerging macro trends in the mid or long-term future, have significant implications to achieve the organisation's strategic plan .'\n\nThe emerging risks were evaluated and reviewed by the Committee during the year. The Committee also considered that monitoring of two new emerging risk areas needed to be added for 2024 these were: (i) the impact on the Company's operations of water stress and drought; and (ii) geopolitical instability.\n\nThe Principal Risks and Uncertainties are reviewed every six months prior to the publication of both the interim and full-year reports. The Committee assessed the increased risk of potential actions by the government arising from the new Mining Law and the Labour Law, which contain relevant implications for mining operations and projects. In addition, the Committee recommended monitoring the following principal risks:\n\n- \u00b7 Security: Increase in organised crime in the vicinity of all mining units and high-impact crimes (homicide, kidnapping and extortion) in the regions where we operate, mainly Zacatecas, Guanajuato and Sonora.\n- \u00b7 Safety: Increased incidents in mining operations such as rock falls, interaction with heavy mobile equipment, roadkill, electrocution, etc.\n- \u00b7 Climate change: Increased regulatory requirements for environmental impact.\n\nFinally, the planned developments in UK regulatory matters relating to Corporate governance and FRC Guidance on audit were considered, as were the Company's initiatives to prevent fraud with updated internal controls.\n\n## Ethical risk\n\nThe Committee monitors the Company's Ethics and Compliance programme through regular reviews of progress with the Group's ABAC programme (including not just the online training programme but also consideration of reports received through the whistleblowing line). This demonstrates that the Group's corporate values and elements of the control culture in relation to ethics remain embedded throughout the organisation. To this end, during the year the Committee received reports on: the roll-out of training in relation to the disclosure of conflicts of interest; the Code of Conduct; Step-Up culture and harassment.\n\nThe Company widened the evaluation of its fraud risk assessment process to reinforce the controls to prevent and detect material fraud. Although the Company has always maintained a firm commitment to prevent and detect fraud through well-established practices and procedures, the Committee has been working closely with internal control and internal audit areas to identify any perceived weaknesses. The external auditors also expanded their procedures in this area.\n\nIn 2023. the Company carried out an externally-facilitated ISO 37001 audit to assess the conformity of the Company's ABAC programme with ISO standards (in line with the UK Ministry of Justice Guidance). Further information about the Company's approach to bribery and corruption is set out on pages 85-86 of the Strategic report.\n\n## Financial risk management\n\nThe Company's objectives and policies on financial risk management including information on the Company's exposures to market risk, such as foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate, inflation rate and equity price risks, credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in note 16 to the financial statements. During the year, the Committee reviewed the Company's Treasury Policy and concluded that no further changes were required.\n\n## Non-financial risk areas\n\nThe Committee regularly reviews and receives management updates on current issues and developments that could have potential to give rise to specific risks. In this, the Committee is guided by regular updates it receives from management on specific issues that it considers should be kept under review. Thus, during 2023, regular reports were received on legal matters (including land titles and litigation) and a review of the Group's compliance with mining licence conditions at each of its business units. Where new potential areas of risk are considered by management as part of their regular reviews of the Risk Matrix, the Committee may request further bespoke updates from management to supplement its general review of risk and internal controls. No new areas of non-financial risk were identified during 2023.\n\n## Information technology\n\nIn 2023, the Committee continued to receive updates on the Group's IT strategy, its linkage to the Group's overall business strategy and the financial implications of that strategy for the business plan. It also monitored the progress of the Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo Management Teams in developing the cybersecurity framework for the Group. Further information about the Group's approach to IT is set out on pages 86 and 171 of the Strategic report.",

        "page_content": "## AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT CONTINUED\n\n## Risk and Controls continued\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Directors must satisfy themselves as to the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a minimum of 12 months from the approval of the financial statements. The Committee supported the Board in this assessment by considering whether the Company has adequate liquid resources to meet its obligations as they fall due. In February 2024, the Committee reviewed the Group's budget and cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2025, taking into account the Company's anticipated production profiles at each mine, budgeted capital and exploration expenditure and the sensitivity of the cashflow forecasts to movements in metals prices, including stress testing those forecasts to identify the levels to which metals prices must fall to put pressure on working capital levels.\n\nThe Committee also considered EY's report on this assessment and on the reasonableness of assumptions therein, including their consistency with assumptions and estimates used elsewhere in the preparation of the financial statements. The Committee also challenged management on the feasibility of the mitigating actions and the potential speed of their implementation. Following this assessment, the Committee satisfied itself that the going concern basis of preparation is appropriate and the financial statements appropriately reflect the conclusions on going concern. The going concern statement is set out in the Strategic report on page 185.\n\n## Viability assessment\n\nThe Executive Team has developed a comprehensive approach to the viability assessment which is then reported in the Viability Statement. The key steps of this approach are explained within the Viability Statement, which is set out in the Strategic report on pages 184-185. In December 2023, the Committee received an update on the approach the Executive Team proposed to take in preparing the Viability Statement and confirmed that the scenarios presented in the previous year and the addition of a new scenario related to a possible strike at the Herradura mine, given the background in May 2023, are maintained for the purposes of the Viability Statement.\n\nIn February 2024, it reviewed the proposed Viability Statement. It also considered the potential steps that could be taken to mitigate the cashflow impacts arising from the most negative scenarios (including delaying project capex or reducing exploration expenditure).\n\n## Internal control\n\nThe Committee assists the Board in monitoring the effectiveness of the Company's internal control environment. This monitoring includes oversight of all material controls including financial, operational, regulatory and compliance. To accomplish this, there is a governance and organisational structure in place where internal control is secured by three lines of defence: process owners (1st line); committees, controllers, risk management and other oversight bodies (2nd line); and internal audit (3rd line). During the year, the Committee considered each of the quarterly internal control reports which were then circulated to the full Board for its review. At the end of the financial year, the Committee oversaw the annual process for monitoring the Group's system of internal controls. In this task, the Committee is directly supported by the independent work of the internal audit team.\n\n## Quarterly internal control reports\n\nDuring 2023, the Committee continued to review each of the quarterly internal controls reports which were prepared and submitted to the Board at each of its regular meetings. This document specifically reports on developments in the Key Risk Indicators and the key internal control issues arising from the quarterly internal audit reports. From time to time, the Committee has proposed changes to those reports based on its own discussion of internal audit's findings.\n\n## Annual review of the system of internal controls\n\nThe Committee undertakes an annual review of the Group's system of internal controls in accordance with Provision 29 of the Code. This review aims to improve the understanding of how the various sources of assurance (through the three lines of defence) interact in the review and execution of material controls by identifying and addressing any gaps in the control framework. Consequently, once a year, the Committee oversees the review of the Group's system of internal controls through an assessment, conducted by management of the various sources of assurance over the execution of material internal controls. This is a comprehensive review incorporating operational management, financial management and Executive Management; along with the independent assessment of material risks and internal controls by internal audit within the third line of defence. This approach underpins assessment of the ongoing effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls and the Committee provides oversight of this process.\n\nRemediation actions arising from the control exceptions identified throughout the year were those related to: (i) continuing to improve the effectiveness of the reporting system on water consumption; ii) enhancing operative discipline and training for safety and environment processes; (iii) improving some IT security controls in mines; and (iv) strengthening cost controls on capital project processes.\n\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer (before the role split) and other senior managers were invited to meet with the Audit Committee to discuss their action plans and progress for remediating the issues identified.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the Board agreed that the following statement be made about the review of the system of internal control in the 2023 annual report.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nThe Board has, through the Executive Committee and the Audit Committee (at its February 2024 meeting), reviewed the effectiveness of the Group's system of internal controls. Following this review, the Board considers that the measures that have been or are planned to be implemented, particularly those specifically highlighted in this report, complement Fresnillo's risk management framework and are appropriate to the Group's circumstances. The Board is committed to the continued development of its internal control regime with a view to achieving and maintaining best practice levels of risk management and internal control for international mining companies listed on the London Stock Exchange.\n\n## Related parties\n\nWith the Company's Parent Company, Pe\u00f1oles, owning just under 75% of the issued share capital of the Company (see page 246), it has and will continue to have a significant level of influence over the affairs and operations of Fresnillo. Being part of the same Group provides an opportunity to achieve synergistic operational, financial and administrative improvements by combining the resourcing of common services that can be shared between Pe\u00f1oles and Fresnillo. Although these arrangements are beneficial to Fresnillo, the Committee performs a role in overseeing these arrangements to ensure that they continue to operate impartially.\n\nThe principal arrangements entered into between the Company and related parties and reviewed by the Committee during the year were:\n\n| The Met-Mex  agreement   | As it does every year, the Audit Committee considered the reasonableness of proposed treatment and refining  charges in respect of the Met-Mex arrangements for 2023, as disclosed in note 5 (c) to the consolidated  financial statements. Management circulated a paper setting out the methodology to determine the charges,  which takes industry benchmark charges and adjusts to reflect ore composition and transport costs. The same  methodology used in 2023 was used as in the previous three years. The Committee reviewed this paper and  recommended approval of the proposed charges by the Independent Directors at the Board meeting in  October 2023.   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                          | As part of its review of the Met-Mex arrangements, the Committee also confirmed with management that the  transfer pricing assessments in respect of prior year transactions (which are undertaken for tax reasons by the  Group's external adviser, PWC), had been completed with no issues noted. A similar assessment in respect of  the 2023 transactions will be received in due course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| Other agreements         | There are other dealings with related parties in the ordinary course of business (e.g. insurance brokerage)  which, although not requiring approval by Independent Directors, will from time-to-time be reviewed by the  Committee to ensure that the arrangements are on a reasonable arm's-length basis. During the year, the Audit  Committee reviewed the annual insurance renewal for which Grupo Nacional Provincial, S.A.B., a related-party,  acted as broker.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\nThe Shared Services Agreement is an agreement between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles which sets out, on an arm's-length basis, the basis, and terms under which several categories of services are provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles (through Baluarte Minero, a specialised services unit within Pe\u00f1oles). The Shared Services Agreement was renewed with effect from 1 January 2023 and must be renewed every five years. Internal audit conducts reviews of approximately one-third of main services provided each year to ensure that these services are provided in accordance with the agreed KPIs. As a result, all services are reviewed by internal audit over a three-year cycle. Internal audit reports to the Committee on its review of the Shared Services Agreement.\n\nThe Audit Committee concluded that the new five-year Shared Services Agreement was reasonable in all respects and was satisfied that new rates were agreed between both parties, taking into account the market price study performed by KPMG, and therefore recommended that the Independent Non-executive Directors approve signing of the Shared Services Agreement by the Company, which they did at the Board meeting in July 2023.\n\nThe following table summarises the approach taken to identify and manage related-party transactions under the Relationship Agreement.\n\n| Process                                                                                                                                                                                               | How this is managed   | Responsibility                      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| If a Director has an interest in a company that could potentially  enter into transactions with a Fresnillo Group Company, the Board  will normally consider that interest under its arrangements for | Directors             | Monitoring of Directors'  interests |",

An explanation of the process adopted in preparing the annual report and analysis of the basis upon which each requirement for it to be 'fair', 'balanced' and 'understandable' had been met was summarised in a paper which the Board reviewed at its meeting on 28 February 2024. The key features of this process were:\n\n- \u00b7 The narrative sections of the annual report were drafted by the members of the team with specific responsibility for the areas referred to in the sections that they prepare. The individuals involved included the Head of Investor Relations, the Head of Risk, the Head of Sustainability, the Compliance Officer and Head of Legal, Company Secretary and Mine Managers.\n- \u00b7 As narrative sections of the annual report were prepared, copies were circulated to Board members for review and comment. Such comments were incorporated into updated versions of the annual report.\n- \u00b7 About a month prior to the annual report being approved by the Board, members of the Audit Committee and other Directors reviewed a current draft enabling them to assess whether the information was consistent with their understanding of the Company's business and the nature and content of discussions at the Board during the year. Comments were received from the Directors on most areas of the annual report, and these were incorporated into subsequent drafts of the annual report. The sections of the annual report which were particularly commented on included: the operations reporting, the Sustainability report and climaterelated disclosures in particular, the presentation of information on diversity and inclusion and the presentation of health and safety information.\n- \u00b7 Suggested changes put forward by the Directors, based on knowledge obtained through Board and Audit Committee papers and discussion and other interactions with management were considered by management in preparing the final version of the annual report.\n- \u00b7 The disclosures relating to climate change, in particular the TCFD statements, were reviewed by members of the Board to ensure that they were consistent with the approach and discussions relating to climate-related change at Board and Committee (particularly the Audit Committee and HSECR Committee) levels.\n- \u00b7 At the same time, internal audit undertook a review exercise of the principal non-financial numbers in the annual report which are extracted from the Company's operational records and their findings were appropriately reflected.\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee also reviewed the annual report and financial statements, taking into account comments made and reports issued by EY and decided to recommend them to the Board for approval.\n\nAs a result of the above procedures, the Board considers that, taken as a whole, the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable.\n\n## The Corporate Governance report which is set out on pages 188-248 has been approved by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Board.\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-executive Director 4 March 2024",

Executive remuneration should be aligned to company purpose and values and be clearly linked to the successful delivery of the company's long-term strategy.\n\nThe alignment of the Group's executive remuneration to the business model is described in the following report.\n\n## Principle Q:\n\nA formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and determining director and senior management remuneration should be established. No director should be involved in deciding their own remuneration outcome.\n\nThe process for determining executive remuneration is described on page 226 and is detailed in the Remuneration Committee's terms of reference which are available on the Company's website. Appropriate consultation with shareholders is undertaken when the Committee considers that a change to the Remuneration policy is needed.\n\n## Principle R:\n\nDirectors should exercise independent judgement and discretion when authorising remuneration outcomes, taking account of company and individual performance, and wider circumstances.\n\nThe Remuneration policy, approved by shareholders, details the level of discretion that the Remuneration Committee has when agreeing variable compensation pay outs for Executive Management.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n#5",

We continue to welcome the support of our shareholders for our remuneration arrangements, and I was pleased to see that this support was again strongly demonstrated at our 2023 AGM. I would like to specifically thank our shareholders for their support in approving the latest changes to the Directors remuneration policy at that AGM.\n\nFor some time, however, the Remuneration Committee has been considering whether the annual bonus arrangements for our senior Management Team could be better aligned to our strategy. As the Company moves from a phase of rapid growth to one of consolidation, we believe that some realignment would be helpful. In 2023 we introduced minor changes to the KPIs to calculate the annual bonus to Executive Committee members and we are planning to review them again in 2024 to complete the alignment of these with our strategy.\n\nThe 2024 targets, performance against those targets and the basis of calculation of bonus points awarded will be disclosed in next year's report.\n\nIn our Remuneration report, we continue to publish remuneration information in respect of our Chief Executive Officer as if he were a member of the Board, even though that is not the case. As ever, I am always interested to hear the views of shareholders on our approach to executive remuneration.\n\nDuring the year, we have applied the Remuneration Policy to executive remuneration without needing to exercise any form of discretion other than those elements of the executive bonus plan which require an element of judgement in determining outcomes for the year.",

It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees.\n\nBenchmarking information on pay and employment conditions provided by Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation was used across the Group in determining salaries for all employee grades including senior management. These reports benchmarked salaries by reference to peer groups in mining, large companies in Mexico and internationally.\n\nThe Company negotiates salary increases with the unions annually, to take effect from 1 April each year. The agreed rates may also be used as the point of reference in setting the annual salary review for the Chief Executive Officer, members of the Executive Committee and non-unionised employees. In 2023, it was agreed that the Chief Executive Officer would receive a salary increase of 7.8% in 2023 in line with other employees. Consequently, the salary payable under Mr Alv\u00eddrez' service agreement is MX$1,172,462.6 per month, which excludes payments for holidays, Company-paid savings contributions and other cash benefits.\n\n## Policy on the alignment of executive remuneration and the market\n\nReviews of the Executive Director and Executive Committee members' remuneration is conducted by Willis Towers Watson from time to time at the request of the Remuneration Committee. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in the policy.\n\nThe Peer Group will be updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has agreed that the Chief Executive's salary should be set within a range of 25-75% of the Peer Group for base salary. This was reviewed in October 2023. The Peer Group consists of the following companies.\n\n## Policy benchmarking Peer Group\n\n| Region    | Peer Group companies      |\n|-----------|---------------------------|\n| Mexico    | Southern Copper (Peru)*   |\n|           | Alamos Gold               |\n| US/Canada | Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd    |\n|           | Centerra Gold             |\n|           | Hecla Mining Co.          |\n|           | IAM Gold                  |\n|           | Newmont Goldcorp          |\n|           | Pan American Silver Corp. |\n|           | Capstone Copper Corp.     |\n| Europe    | Hochschild Mining         |\n|           | Antofagasta               |\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\n## Policy on Annual Bonus Plan and variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of longterm sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.\n\n## Factors considered in setting the bonus\n\nThe Annual Bonus Plan includes metrics and targets which are aligned to at least one of the four main themes of the Group's strategy (see remuneration at a glance section on pages 226-227).\n\nThe Remuneration Committee has set a cap on each of the KPIs (other than the Safety KPI) such that the points awarded on any KPI (other than Safety) cannot exceed 135% of the target set for that KPI at the beginning of the year.",

The PTU payable in respect of 2023, payments are capped at the higher of three months' salary or the average PTU received in the last three years.\n\n## 2024 Bonus targets\n\nThe Remuneration Committee agreed that 2024 indicators, weightings and measures should be similar as in 2023. In 2023 the Committee introduced minor changes to the KPIs to calculate the annual bonus to Executive Committee members and we are planning to review them again in 2024 to complete the alignment of these with the Company's strategy.\n\nThe 2024 targets, performance against those targets and the basis of calculation of bonus points awarded will be disclosed in next year's Directors' Remuneration report.\n\n## Pension entitlement\n\n## Policy on pensions\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5-8% of salary. Executive Directors may participate the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.\n\nMr Alv\u00eddrez is a member of the defined benefit scheme in relation to services with the Company prior to 1 July 2007. He is also a member of the defined contribution scheme. He is expected to retire at his normal retirement age of 60 years.\n\n## Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\n## Policy on Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. The Chairman of the Company does not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Nonexecutive Director.\n\nWith effect from 26 July 2023, the fees payable to Non-executive Directors were calculated on the following bases:\n\n- \u00b7 A base fee of \u00a342,000 per annum is paid to each non-UK-based Non-executive Director to reflect the time commitment and level of involvement they are required to make in the activities of the Board as a whole.\n- \u00b7 There are no set fees for membership of any Board committees or for the chairmanship of the Board, other than as follows:\n- -The UK-based Non-executive Directors receive a higher fee, currently \u00a3108,000 per annum, to reflect the additional time commitment that they make in order to travel to Board meetings in Mexico and for responsibilities as committee members and, where appropriate, as Senior Independent Director and/or Chairman of any committee.\n- -The Chairman of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a318,000 per annum.\n- -Members of the Audit Committee will receive an additional fee of \u00a36,000 per annum.",

The current term expires on the date of the next Annual General Meeting, but the appointment will continue after that date provided that each Director is re-elected at the AGM.\n\n## Shareholders and remuneration\n\n## Policy on engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration Policy and its application.\n\n## AGM voting on the Remuneration report\n\nThe Remuneration Committee's approach to executive remuneration has received strong support from shareholders at every Annual General Meeting since the Company's listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2008. More than 65% of independent share votes cast on the advisory vote at each AGM have been in favour of the Directors' Remuneration report.\n\n|                           | All shares voted   | All shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | Independent shares voted   | No. of votes  withheld   |\n|---------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Year                      | For                | Against            | For                        | Against                    |                          |\n| 2022: Remuneration policy | 97.94%             | 1.76%              | 89.21%                     | 10.79%                     | 32,689                   |\n| 2022: Remuneration report | 98.24%             | 2.6%               | 90.77%                     | 9.23%                      | 34,737                   |\n| 2023: Remuneration policy | 94.15%             | 5.85%              | 68.15%                     | 31.85%                     | 752,104                  |\n| 2023: Remuneration report | 98.47%             | 1.53%              | 91.74%                     | 8.26%                      | 17,493                   |\n\n## Advisers to the Remuneration Committee\n\nRemuneration consultants (Mercer, Hay Group and Data Compensation) are engaged by Group companies to provide benchmarking information on remuneration across the Fresnillo Group but not to provide guidance on the structure of remuneration. Such information is taken into account when considering Executive Committee remuneration. Willis Towers Watson advises the Remuneration Committee on executive remuneration matters from time to time. During 2023 the Group paid Willis Towers Watson US$5k (2022: US$nil). All of the consultants that the Group uses are independent of the Company and each of the Directors. No remuneration consultants are directly engaged by the Remuneration Committee itself.\n\nThe Company Secretary ensures that the Remuneration Committee fulfils its duties under its terms of reference and arranges regular updates to the Remuneration Committee on relevant regulatory developments in the UK. The Group human resources department provides information on Mexican market trends and compensation structures for the broader employee population in the Fresnillo Group.",

The Remuneration Committee has assessed the criteria recommended by provision 40 of the 2018 UK Corporate governance Code and believes that the Policy has always been inherently clear, simple, designed to avoid excessive rewards, predictable and proportionate. The effective date of the Policy is 23 May 2023. The full text of the current Remuneration Policy can be found on pages 206 to 210 of the Fresnillo plc 2022 annual report and accounts, which can be found on the Company's website (www.fresnilloplc.com).\n\nAs required by English law, the Company's approved Remuneration Policy is binding in relation to Directors. The Company currently has no Executive Directors who would be bound by the Remuneration Policy. However, the Company will (as it has previously done) treat the Chief Executive Officer as if he were an Executive Director for the purposes of the Remuneration Policy and for reporting on his remuneration.\n\nDetails of the remuneration paid to the Chief Executive Officer for the year ended 31 December 2023 can be found in this year's annual report on remuneration at page 236.\n\n## Remuneration policy\n\nThe Group's Remuneration Policy seeks to ensure that the Company is able to attract, retain and motivate its Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee. The retention of key management and the alignment of management incentives and the creation of shareholder value being key objectives of this policy.\n\nSetting base salaries for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee at an appropriate level is a key to managerial retention in Mexico. Therefore, the Remuneration Committee seeks to ensure that salaries are market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies. Total compensation is set within a range around the median level for the Company's peer group within Mexico and internationally, total remuneration is benchmarked triennially to ensure that the whole remuneration package is maintained at this level over the long term. Salaries are positioned within the range according to experience and service.\n\nThe table below sets out the key elements of Executive Directors' pay set out in the Remuneration policy (the 'policy table'):\n\n## Base salary\n\n## Provides the core reward for the role.\n\n| Operation   | Normally reviewed annually and fixed for 12 months starting on 1 April each year.

Information relating to the Mexican economic metrics is collated by management for the Remuneration Committee to consider.\n\nReviews of the Executive Directors' and Executive Committee members' remuneration are conducted by Willis Towers Watson from time to time at the request of the Remuneration Committee. These enable the Remuneration Committee to validate the Company's policy towards remuneration and ensure that it is globally as well as locally competitive. The analysis evaluates the elements of base salary, short-term compensation (guaranteed payments and short-term bonus) and long-term compensation (primarily stock programmes) separately. With assistance from Willis Towers Watson, the Remuneration Committee has established a peer group which will be used to benchmark any Executive Director's and any Executive Committee member's remuneration (the 'Peer Group') to ensure that it remains within the parameters set out in this Policy (see page 232 of the annual report on remuneration). The Peer Group will be updated where necessary, to ensure that it remains an appropriate comparator group of companies.\n\n## The consideration of wider employment conditions and remuneration\n\nWhen setting pay and benefits for Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, the Remuneration Committee takes account of pay and conditions across the Group. It will consider the overall pay increase percentage negotiated each year, with employee representatives as its starting point taking account of inflation and other information supporting the annual pay award for employees. Subject to the 10% limit in the Policy Table, the Remuneration Committee may agree pay increases above or below the agreed percentage in exceptional circumstances, where in its discretion it considers such variance to the norm to be justified. Other than the Willis Towers Watson report specifically commissioned by the Remuneration Committee, the same benchmark reports are used in the evaluation of executive and employee remuneration, thus providing a common approach to both.\n\nBelow Board level, a statutory profit-sharing arrangement (PTU) is operated which in some years has enabled employees to receive significant levels of bonus in line with the increased profitability of the relevant employing company. The Chief Executive Officer does not participate in a PTU scheme within the Fresnillo Group. Members of the senior management group below Board-level are employed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo S.A. de C.V. or Operaciones Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which pay annual PTU payments. However, such payments are modest.\n\nThe Group operates two pension schemes: (i) a defined benefit scheme which was closed to new members on 1 July 2007 with benefits frozen at this date for existing members, subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index; and (ii) a defined contribution scheme (which was introduced on 1 July 2007). Membership of the latter scheme is voluntary, members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time may make contributions of 5% to the scheme.\n\nOn behalf of members earning a salary of no more than 25 times the minimum wage in force from time to time the employing company may make contributions of 5% to the scheme. The employing company may also make additional contributions between 5-8% of salary to this plan. Members may elect to match percentages between 5-8% of salary.\n\nExecutive Directors may participate in the Group's pension schemes on the same basis as any other employee.",

        "page_content": "Governance\n\nThe Remuneration Committee does not consult with employees in setting Directors' remuneration. Engagement with employees as a stakeholder group is primarily the responsibility of the Board; however, where appropriate, the Remuneration Committee will consider any relevant feedback from employees to the Board in relation to remuneration matters when discharging its responsibilities under this Policy.\n\n## Engagement with shareholders on remuneration\n\nThe composition of the Remuneration Committee has been designed to ensure that the views of the controlling shareholder (through the membership of the Chairman of the Board on the Committee) and the independent shareholders can be represented. The Remuneration Committee has considered the views of organisations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) and the Investment Association both generally and as reported to the Company in relation to its own executive remuneration practices prior to each Annual General Meeting, when considering the Remuneration policy and its application. Following the Company's AGM in 2024, details of votes cast for and against the resolutions to approve the proposed Remuneration policy and annual report on remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023, will be announced to the market.\n\n## Policy on recruitment\n\nThe Remuneration Committee will consider the remuneration of new Executive Directors by reference to the Policy Table set out above. The Remuneration Committee will not, as a matter of standard practice, pay sign-on payments or compensate new Directors for any variable remuneration forfeited from any employment prior to joining the Board. However, it may choose to do so in exceptional circumstances, when it considers this to be in the best interests of the Company (and therefore shareholders), in which case any buyout payments will not exceed the remuneration relinquished and will mirror (as far as possible) the delivery mechanism, time horizons and performance requirements attached to that remuneration. Where possible this will be facilitated through the Company's existing Annual Bonus Plan, as set out in the Policy Table above, but if not, the Remuneration Committee may fulfil this requirement in line with the provisions of 9.4.2 of the Listing Rules.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the value of any 'sign-on' and/or 'buy-out' payments will not count towards the limits on annual bonus in the Policy Table above. Any such payments will be fully explained in the next annual report on remuneration both as to the reason for payment and the rationale for the quantum.\n\nSalary will be set so as to be market competitive both within the Mexican context and internationally for comparable companies and taking account of the experience and seniority of the appointee coming into the new role. The Remuneration Committee is likely to set base salaries below median on appointment while retaining discretion to award increases during the first and, possibly, subsequent years to bring salaries into the normal range expected for Executive Directors, in line with the Company's stated Policy. Such increases will not exceed the maximum level set out in the Policy Table. New Executive Directors will receive benefits and pensions in line with the Company's existing Policy and will be able to participate in the Annual Bonus Plan on a pro-rated basis for the portion of the financial year for which they are in post. The maximum level of variable pay for new recruits will be the same as that set out in the Policy Table for existing employees (pro-rated as necessary).\n\nIn the case of an internal appointment or promotion, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role will be allowed to pay out according to its original terms stipulated on grant or adjusted as considered desirable to reflect the new role.\n\nWhere appropriate to recruit, promote or transfer individuals to a different location of residence, the Remuneration Committee may also, to the extent it considers reasonable, approve the payment of one-off relocation and repatriation related expenses. It may also pay or make a contribution towards any legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with their employment by the Group.\n\n## Policy on loss of office\n\nOther than in circumstances of gross misconduct, Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer, leaving employment from the Group, will be entitled to receive salary and pro-rated annual bonus based on performance to the date of leaving. Statutory entitlements are payable according to Mexican labour law, based on length of service. Employee and Company pension contributions are payable in accordance with the applicable pension plan rules. Mexican labour law does not make any provision for employers and employees to give or receive notice of termination of employment. Therefore, the Committee will not generally make payments in lieu of notice to departing executives. However, the Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation), or by way of settlement or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an Executive Director's office or employment or by way of contribution to legal fees appropriately incurred by the individual in connection with the termination of their employment by the Group. No contractual commitments concerning loss of office were entered into with any Director prior to 27 June 2012.\n\n## Annual Bonus Plan and policy on variable remuneration\n\nIt is the Company's policy not to use its equity to incentivise long-term performance. The Company's core strategy is one of long-term sustainable growth. Sustainable growth in mining requires the steady and safe expansion of the Group's operations through the discovery of new resources and construction, maintenance and/or expansion of new mines. No distinction is therefore made between short and long-term incentives.",

        "page_content": "## DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED\n\n## Appendix: proposed Directors' Remuneration Policy\n\nThe Company operates a single cash-based Annual Bonus Plan for Executive Directors and the members of the Executive Committee, including the Chief Executive Officer as described in the Policy Table above. In the event of a change of control, the Remuneration Committee shall, in accordance with the Annual Bonus Plan rules, as amended from time to time and in its absolute discretion, determine whether and to what extent the annual bonus will vest and be paid early. The Committee may also decide that the bonus award will vest to a greater or lesser extent having regard to the Director's or the Group's performance or such other factors it may consider appropriate. The Remuneration Committee may decide that bonus awards will vest pro-rata to take account of early vesting or in full.\n\n## Recovery of bonus\n\nThe absence of long-term incentives and the operation of Mexican law makes it difficult to adopt claw-back arrangements in order to recover bonuses that have already been paid. The Remuneration Committee has considered whether claw-back provisions should be incorporated into the service agreement for the Chief Executive Officer. Given that the Company does not operate any remuneration plans with a timeframe of more than one year, the Remuneration Committee does not consider that there is much value in introducing claw-back provisions into the contractual arrangements with the Chief Executive Officer at this stage. However, within this Remuneration Policy, the Remuneration Committee reserves the right to apply malus to bonuses before they are paid where the KPI outcomes would result, in the opinion of the Remuneration Committee, in a bonus payment which cannot be justified by the Company's financial performance or the Executive Director's personal performance during the year (or previous years). In this case a downward adjustment to the bonus payment would be applied.\n\n## Illustrations of the application of the Remuneration Policy for the Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe following table sets out the fixed and variable remuneration of the Chief Executive Officer in the different scenarios where he receives, minimum, target and maximum variable pay (based on 31 December 2023 remuneration).\n\n| Component          |         | Maximum value US$ thousands   | Minimum   | Target    | Maximum   |\n|--------------------|---------|-------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Share incentives 1 |         |                               |           |           | US$1,766k |\n| Annual bonus       | US$396k | Annual variable pay 2, 4      |           | US$1,502k | 22.4%     |\n|                    |         |                               |           | 8.8%      |           |\n| Pension benefits   | 102     | Fixed pay 3                   | 100%      | 91.2%     | 77.6%     |\n| Other benefits     | 157     |                               |           | 8.8%      |           |\n\n- 1 Fresnillo plc does not operate any share option or share-based long-term incentive plans.\n- 2 Variable pay consists only of remuneration where performance measures or targets relate only to one financial year.\n- 3 Fixed pay includes salary, benefits and pension.\n- 4 The Company does not operate any equity-based long-term incentives, consequently, the Company's share price does not have any impact on the variable remuneration paid to Executive Directors and members of the Executive Committee who do not sit on the Board.\n\n## External appointments\n\nIt is the Board's policy to allow Executive Directors to accept directorships of other quoted and non-quoted companies and retain any fees or other remuneration for doing so, provided that they have obtained the consent of the Chairman of the Company. Any such directorships must be formally notified to the Board.\n\n## Chairman and Non-executive Directors\n\nThe remuneration of the Chairman of the Company and the Non-executive Directors consists of fees that are paid quarterly in arrears. The Chairman and Non-executive Directors do not participate in any long-term incentive or annual bonus schemes, nor do they accrue any pension entitlement. Neither the Chairman nor any of the Non-executive Directors has a service contract with the Company; however, each has entered into a letter of appointment with the Company.\n\n## Non-executive Directors' letters of appointment\n\nOn their initial appointment, each of the Non-executive Directors sign a letter of appointment with the Company. The letters of appointment of serving Non-executive Directors are drafted in accordance with Provision 18 of the UK Corporate governance Code, thus obliging them to retire at each Annual General Meeting and be subject to annual re-election by shareholders to serve for a further term of one year. The amendments have been drafted such that renewed appointment will not necessitate a new letter of appointment.\n\nThe Chairman of the Company shall not receive any fees for acting as Chairman other than his fees as a Non-executive Director. Each Non-executive Director is expected to commit a minimum of 14 days per year in fulfilling their duties as a Director of the Company.\n\nThe total fees for Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman, will not exceed the maximum stated in the Company's Articles of Association.\n\nThe level of fees is reviewed periodically and takes into account the time commitment, responsibilities, market levels and the skills and experience required. Non-executive Directors normally receive a basic fee and an additional fee for specific Board responsibilities, including chairmanship or membership of Board committees or acting as the Senior Independent Director. Additional fees may be paid to Non-executive Directors on a per diem basis to reflect increased time commitment in certain limited circumstances.",

The Company does not operate share-based incentive arrangements given that the culture for incentives in the Mexican market does not favour share-based incentives. Consequently, there would be neither opportunity nor appetite for executives to build a shareholding in the Company and therefore the Remuneration Committee has not adopted any shareholding guidelines.\n\n## Payments under previous policies\n\nAny remuneration payment or benefit, or any payment for loss of office which a Director received or became entitled to under a previous Remuneration Policy or before the person became a Director (unless the payment was in consideration of becoming a director) shall lawfully be paid out under this policy, even though it may not be consistent with, or otherwise provided for under, the Policy Table set out above.",

A retiring Director is eligible for election or re-election, as applicable.\n\nSubject to the Articles, the Companies Act 2006 and related legislation and any regulations as may be prescribed by special resolution of the Company, the Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company.\n\nNo shareholder holds securities carrying special rights as to the control of the Company. There are no limitations on the holding of securities. There are no restrictions on voting rights or any arrangements by which, with the Company's cooperation, financial rights carried by securities are held by a person other than the holder of the securities. There are no agreements between holders of securities that are known to the Company which may result in restrictions on the transfer of voting rights.\n\nThe Sterling Deferred Shares only entitle the shareholder to payment of the amount paid up after repayment to ordinary shareholders on winding up or on a return of capital. The Sterling Deferred Shares do not entitle the holder to payment of any dividend, or to receive notice or to attend and speak at any general meeting of the Company. The Company may also at its option redeem the Sterling Deferred Shares at a price of \u00a31.00 or, as custodian, purchase or cancel the Sterling Deferred Shares or require the holder to transfer the Sterling Deferred Shares. Except at the option of the Company, the Sterling Deferred Shares are not transferable.\n\nThe Company's operations are outside the UK. The Company, through various subsidiaries, has established branches in a number of jurisdictions in which it operates (mainly in Mexico).\n\nThe following represents the likely effect on significant agreements with the Company were it to be subject to a change of control:\n\n- \u00b7 The Shared Services Agreement contains a discretionary provision for Servicios Administrativos Pe\u00f1oles, S.A. de C.V., to terminate the agreement should they so wish if there is a change of control of Fresnillo plc.\n- \u00b7 There are no formal 'change of control' provisions within the Silverstream contract or Met-Mex arrangements.\n- \u00b7 The Group's mining concessions are held by several of its Mexican subsidiary companies. As long as the companies holding the mining concessions remain Mexican resident companies, there are no provisions within the concession agreements which would be triggered by a change of control of the Company.\n\nThe Company does not have any agreements with any Non-executive Director, Executive Director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or employment resulting from a change of control.",

The Directors have elected to prepare the Group and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK-adopted International Accounting Standards.\n\nIn preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:\n\n- \u00b7 select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8: 'Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors' and then apply them consistently;\n- \u00b7 make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\n- \u00b7 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;\n- \u00b7 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Company and of the Group's financial position and financial performance;\n- \u00b7 state whether UK-adopted international accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and\n- \u00b7 prepare the accounts on a going concern basis unless, having assessed the ability of the Company and the Group to continue as a going concern unless it is appropriate to presume that the Company and/or the Group will not continue in business.\n\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company's and Group's transactions and which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.\n\nUnder applicable UK law and regulations, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of a Strategic report, Directors' report, Directors' Remuneration report and Corporate Governance statement that comply with that law and regulations. In addition, the Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company's website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\n\nNeither the Company nor the Directors accept any liability to any person in relation to the annual financial report except to the extent that such liability could arise under English law. Accordingly, any liability to a person who has demonstrated reliance on any untrue or misleading statement or omission shall be determined in accordance with section 90A and schedule 10A of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000.\n\n## Directors' responsibility statement under the UK corporate governance code\n\nIn accordance with Provision 27 of the 2018 UK Corporate governance Code, the Directors consider that the annual report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides information necessary to enable shareholders to assess the Company's position, performance, business model and strategy.\n\n## Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect of the annual report and accounts\n\nEach of the Directors whose names are listed on pages 194-197 confirm that to the best of their knowledge:\n\n- a)  the consolidated financial statements, prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit and loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and\n- b)  the annual report (including the Strategic report encompassed within the 'Overview', 'Strategic report', 'Performance' and 'Governance' sections) includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business, and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.\n\nFor and on behalf of the Board.\n\n## Alberto Tiburcio\n\nIndependent Non-executive Director 4 March 2024",

Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Independence\n\nWe are independent of the Group and parent in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC's Ethical Standard as applied to listed public interest entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe did not provide any non-audit services prohibited by the FRC's Ethical Standard to the Group or the Parent Company and we remain independent of the Group and the Parent Company in conducting the audit.\n\nWe provided limited assurance services on ESG key performance indicators to the Group in addition to the audit and which have not been disclosed in the annual report or financial statements.\n\n## Conclusions relating to going concern\n\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors' assessment of the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following procedures:\n\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process to confirm our understanding of management's going concern assessment process;\n- \u00b7 During January 2024, the Group entered into a US$350 million revolving credit facility that contains financial covenants. We confirmed through inquiries of management, review of bank statements and subsequent event procedures that, as of the date of our audit opinion, no amounts have been drawn;\n- \u00b7 We verified the terms, maturity, interest rates, and any restrictions or covenants that are relevant to the senior notes and revolving credit facility held by the Group at the date of approving of the financial statements against the original contracts;\n- \u00b7 We assessed management's forecasting accuracy by comparing forecasts to actuals for the year ended 31 December 2023 and assessing the reasons for differences, including the effect of market-driven factors;\n- \u00b7 We assessed the completeness of the factors included in the going concern assessment by verifying the consistency of key assumptions with our understanding of the business and the environment within which it operates;\n- \u00b7 We obtained management's going concern assessment and test of compliance with covenants, including cash forecast for the going concern period which extends to 31 December 2025. The Group has modelled plausible adverse changes and applied reverse stress testing in respect of prices to assess the impact on the forecast liquidity of the Group (before considering the new facility);\n- \u00b7 We tested the factors and assumptions included in the base case and most severe adverse scenario for the cash forecast, in particular comparing forecast metals prices to analyst forecasts and comparing production forecasts to 2023 production, plant capacity and our understanding of the business and its future plans;",

We requested an additional scenario with a combination of price reductions and cost increases to evaluate liquidity and compliance with covenants, and assessed the likelihood of such a scenario;\n- \u00b7 Given that the additional reverse stress test scenario did not factor in the full use of the new facility, we performed a further assessment to determine what level of price reductions would lead to the Group utilising all liquidity during the going concern period. Our assessment is that the likelihood of this reverse stress test scenario eventuating is remote;\n- \u00b7 We reviewed the Group's going concern disclosures included in note 2 of the financial statements, in order to evaluate whether the disclosures were appropriate.\n\n## Our key observations:\n\n- \u00b7 The Directors' assessment forecasts that the Group will maintain sufficient liquidity and will comply with the financial covenants throughout the going concern assessment period in all scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group and Parent Company's ability to continue as a going concern for the period which extends to 31 December 2025.\n- \u00b7 In relation to the Group and Parent Company's reporting on how they have applied the UK Corporate Governance Code, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to the Directors' statement in the financial statements about whether the Directors considered it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis of accounting.\n- \u00b7 Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group or Parent's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\n## Overview of our audit approach\n\n| Audit scope   | \u00b7 \u00b7   | Out of 12 components in scope, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of eight components  being the six operating mining units (Fresnillo, Penmont, Saucito, Juanicipio, San Juli\u00e1n and Ci\u00e9nega), the Parent  Company and the entity which holds the Silverstream contract. (Comercializadora de Metales Fresnillo). These  components represented 100% of revenues, 100% of the Silverstream revaluation effects and 97% of total assets  We performed specified procedures on certain balances at a further three components. These components  represented 3% of total assets.   |\n|---------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Key audit     | \u00b7     | Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| matters       | \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 | Valuation of the Silverstream contract Recoverable amount of mining assets Recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries (Parent Company only)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\n## An overview of the scope of the Group and Parent Company audits\n\n## Tailoring the scope\n\nOur assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the Group and effectiveness of Group-wide controls, changes in the business environment, the potential impact of climate change and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.\n\nIn assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the 15 reporting components of the Group, we selected 12 components covering entities within Mexico and Chile, which represent the principal business units within the Group.\n\nOf the 12 components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of eight components ('full scope components') which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. For the remaining three components ('specified procedures scope components'), we performed audit procedures on specific accounts within each component that we considered had the potential for the greatest impact on the significant accounts in the financial statements either because of the size of these accounts or their risk profile. We perform other procedures on one additional component.\n\nThe reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2022: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2022: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects and 99% (2022: 99%) of the Group's total assets. For the current year, the full scope components contributed 100% (2022: 100%) of the Group's revenues, 100% (2022: 100%) of the Silverstream revaluation effects and 97% (2022: 97%) of the Group's total assets.\n\nWe noted that some entities presented financial losses in 2023, which distorted the coverage assessment over the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit. Therefore, when calculating their overall contribution, this shows a coverage exceeding 100% of the Group's Adjusted Normalised Profit (2022: 96%).",

Of the eight full scope components, audit procedures were performed on one of these directly by the primary audit team and, on another component, procedures were performed in conjunction by the primary and component teams. For all full scope components and specified procedures components where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the appropriate level of involvement to enable us to determine that sufficient audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group as a whole.\n\nSenior members of the component team and the Pe\u00f1oles audit team attended our virtual global planning meetings during the planning phase of the audit, and we discussed the results of interim procedures and interacted regularly with the local team in Mexico. The primary engagement team is predominantly composed of Spanish speakers to further enhance our interactions with both the component team and management.\n\nThe primary team visited Mexico during both the planning and execution phases, including the Senior Statutory Auditor for the latter, with members of the team working with and supervising the component team in Mexico for a number of weeks over two visits. These visits involved discussion and oversight of the component team audit approach, consideration of significant accounting and auditing issues arising from their work, reviewing key audit working papers, meeting with management and attending closing meetings.\n\nThe primary team was responsible for the scope and direction of the audit process. For certain procedures, in particular areas involving significant judgement and heightened audit risk, we performed work ourselves with support where required from the component team. In other cases, we reviewed key working papers including, but not limited to, the risk areas described below.",

This, together with the additional procedures performed at Group level, gave us appropriate evidence for our opinion on the Group financial statements.\n\n## Climate change\n\nThere has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact Fresnillo plc. The Group has determined that the most significant adverse future impacts from climate change on its operations are likely to be from water stress and drought, transition to a low-carbon future and increasing societal and investor expectations. These are explained on pages 111-128 in the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures and on pages 180-181 in the principal risks and uncertainties, which form part of the 'Other information' rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.\n\nIn planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the Group's business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements. As explained in note 2 (c) to the Group and Parent Company financial statements, governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. The degree of certainty of these changes may also mean that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset and liability valuations and the timing of future cash flows under the requirements of UK adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. Significant judgements and estimates relating to climate change have been described in note 2 (c).\n\nOur audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed on pages 180-181, have been appropriately considered in the assessment of indicators of impairment of long-term non-financial assets and the timing and quantum of future cash flows underpinning the provision of mine closure costs and associated disclosures. We also considered whether other assets and liabilities were susceptible to material changes in measurement as a result of climate risks and opportunities. As part of this evaluation, we performed our own risk assessment, supported by our climate change internal specialists, to determine the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements from climate change which needed to be considered in our audit. Details of our procedures and findings on the assessment of impairment indicators are included in our key audit matters below where relevant.\n\nWe also challenged the Directors' considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern and viability and associated disclosures.\n\nBased on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter, however we have incorporated climate change considerations into our procedures over key audit matters where applicable.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Key audit matter: Recognition of related party transactions, including revenue recognition \uf098 1\n\n- \u00b7 Approximately 99% of the Group's current year revenue from the sale of goods being concentrates, dor\u00e9, activated carbon, slag and precipitates, excluding hedging (US$2,704.5 million; 2022: US$2,436.8 million), and a significant amount of its expenses incurred (US$240.4 million; 2022: US$163.2 million), arise from transactions with related parties (2022:100%). The Silverstream contract is also with a related party. These related parties are all subsidiaries of the Group's direct parent, Industrias Pe\u00f1oles, S.A.B. de C.V. (Pe\u00f1oles).\n- \u00b7 Principal transactions include the sale of goods to the Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles refinery, administrative services received and the Silverstream contract.\n- \u00b7 There is a risk that, if not at arm's length or not reflecting the goods or services provided in the period, such transactions could be used to manipulate earnings or to distribute profits to the Group's parent.\n- \u00b7 There is also a risk that revenues are inappropriately recognised as a result of incorrect cut-off or inappropriate measurement of product sold.\n- \u00b7 There is an ongoing focus by the Mexican tax authorities on transfer pricing as reflected by recently concluded and ongoing tax inspections. There is therefore the potential risk of tax exposures arising from related party transactions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nRelated party transactions are disclosed in note 27 to the consolidated financial statements, revenues in note 5 and relevant accounting policies in note 2.",

These assumptions require management judgement and estimation.\n- \u00b7 The resulting valuation is sensitive to changes in future silver prices, total volume of production and the discount rate applied which may result in material revaluation effects in the financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nWe have not made significant changes to our audit response compared to the prior year.\n\nThe nature of the Silverstream contract and related valuation considerations are disclosed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements and the relevant accounting policies in note 2.\n\n## Our audit response\n\n| We performed full scope audit procedures over the valuation of the Silverstream contract at 31 December 2023 and related income  statement revaluation effects.

We made inquiries of management in financial and operational areas in respect of their review of the Sabinas  mine plan prepared by Pe\u00f1oles, focusing on the comparisons between the current year plan and the 2022 plan.

There is no impairment recorded in prior years that may be reversed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area has increased from prior year due to the identification of impairment triggers in Fresnillo, Ci\u00e9nega, Saucito and San Juli\u00e1n mining units.\n\nWe have considered the possible effect of climate change in the impairment trigger assessment, in line with the prior year.\n\nManagement's assessment of the judgement and estimation required is set out in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, with the results of management's assessment for impairment in note 13. The reserves and resources tables are presented after the Parent Company notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in seven components and specified procedures over this risk in one component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\nIndicators of impairment and methodology used to estimate recoverable values\n\nEstimation process for reserves and resources including external specialists engaged by management\n\n- \u00b7 We evaluated management's identification of indicators of impairment under IAS 36 'Impairment of assets' and considered whether climate risks could represent indicators.\n- \u00b7 We challenged management's assessment with particular emphasis on whether operational issues, cost increases and decreases in estimations of reserves and resources would result in an impairment trigger by performing our own independent assessment based on inputs calculated by our valuation specialists.\n- \u00b7 We verified information from our procedures in respect of reserves and resources (as described below) to management's indicator assessment to ensure that the most recent reserves information was used.\n- \u00b7 We considered the results of our other procedures, including in respect of the mine closure provision and our analytical review procedures over production to evaluate whether there were any unidentified indicators of impairment.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our valuation specialists, who independently assessed management's approach against industry practices, we assessed the methodology used by management to estimate the recoverable value of each mining asset for which an impairment test was performed to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards.\n- \u00b7 We performed substantive procedures over the estimation of reserves and resources to evaluate the extent to which we can rely on those estimates when concluding whether an indicator of impairment existed.\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process of the estimation of the reserves and resources quantities and identified relevant controls.\n- \u00b7 We walked through the process of determining mine plans from estimated reserves and resources quantities.\n\n\u00b7\n\nWe assessed the competence of the Reserves and Resources Specialists, as well as capabilities and objectivity\n\nas specialists engaged by management to audit the Group's estimates of reserves and resources and confirmed\n\nthe scope of their work was appropriate for the purpose of financial reporting.\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the potential impact of climate related matters on the estimates.\n- \u00b7 We read the reports prepared by the Reserves and Resources Specialists, gained an understanding of the changes in reserves and resources estimates in the year and considered their observations on the Group's reserve and resource estimation process insofar as they affect the financial statements.\n- \u00b7 We engaged our own specialist (geologist) to evaluate the information provided by the Reserves and Resources specialists.\n- \u00b7 We discussed directly with the Reserves and Resources specialists the results of their reports.",

Refer to related considerations in the key audit matter above.\n- \u00b7 In addition, management estimates the recoverable value of exploration projects in considering the recoverable value of subsidiaries.\n- \u00b7 Changes to assumptions could lead to material changes in estimated recoverable amounts, resulting in either impairment or reversals of impairment taken in prior years (2023 aggregate net impairment of US$730.8 million, 2022: US$1,755.0 million).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOur judgement is that the level of risk in this area, on balance, remains consistent with the prior year.\n\nAs with the recoverable amount of mining assets, in the current year we have also considered the possible effect of climate change in the impairment trigger assessment.\n\n## Our audit response\n\nWe performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area in one component, which covered 100% of the risk amount.\n\n| Indicators of  impairment and  methodology  used to estimate  recoverable values   | We assessed the methodology used by management to determine whether there were any indicators of  impairment for each investment in subsidiaries to ensure that this is consistent with accounting standards.

Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.\n\nWe determined materiality for the Group to be US$17.0 million (2022: US$21.0 million), which is 5% (2022: 5%) of the five-year average profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects, adjusted for any material one-off transactions ('Adjusted Normalised Profit'). At planning, we use forecast profit figures to estimate materiality for 2023. We revisited our materiality at year-end noting that actual profits for the year supported our assessment made at planning. We believe this measure of profit represents one of the main considerations for members of the Group, particularly as the Silverstream revaluation effects are principally non-cash in nature and one-off transactions are not reflective of the ongoing operations of the business.\n\nWe have concluded that, solely for the purposes of determining materiality, there are sufficient indicators to normalise the basis for determining materiality using the five-year average, which is in line with the directors' viability assessment period. An illustration of our approach to Adjusted Normalised Profit is set out below, with profit before tax prior to Silverstream revaluation effects as the starting point. US$ million\n\nWe determined materiality for the Parent Company to be US$42.4 million (2022: US$47.1 million) which is 1% (2022: 1%) of equity. The materiality of the Parent Company is higher than that of the Group, reflective of the Parent Company's primary role being that of a holding company.\n\n## Performance materiality\n\nThe application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.\n\nOn the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group's overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2022:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- Adjusted Normalised Profit used in materiality calculation\n\nExcluded one-off expense\n\n- Five-year average\n\n75%) of our planning materiality, namely US$13.0 million (2022: US$16.0 million) for the Group and US$31.8 million (2022: US$35.3 million) for the Parent Company. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to the level of historical misstatements, our ability to assess the likelihood of misstatements and the effectiveness of the internal control environment.\n\nAudit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.\n\nAssigned performance materiality decreased in all components, reflecting the overall performance of the Group. Where assigned performance materiality decreased, this represents the changes in the relative contribution of profit of that component. The allocation of performance materiality to full scope components is as follows:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  The icons correspond to the key audit matters set out above. Audit procedures in respect of the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries are performed at the performance materiality of the standalone parent company financial statements.\n\nReflecting the fact that dividends are a key focus for shareholders and that the dividends are derived from the operating results of the Group, we apply Group materiality to our procedures around dividends, including distributable reserves.",

The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nOur responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n## Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud\n\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below.\n\nHowever, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management.\n\n- \u00b7 We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant are those related to the reporting framework (UK adopted international accounting standards and Companies Act 2006 and UK Corporate Governance Code), regulations impacting mining operations including mining laws, environmental and labour regulations and tax and employee profit-sharing requirements in Mexico.\n- \u00b7 With the assistance of our forensics specialists, we understood how Fresnillo plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of management, internal audit, those responsible for legal and compliance procedures and the company secretary. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers provided to the Audit Committee.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n- \u00b7 We assessed the susceptibility of the Group's financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it is considered there was a susceptibility of fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included using data analytics to test manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free of fraud or error. In the current year, forensic specialists reviewed our fraud risk assessment and assisted on our journal entry testing procedures.\n- \u00b7 Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved enquiries of Group management and those charged with governance, legal counsel, internal audit, and the risk and compliance departments; journal entry testing, with a focus on manual journals and those indicating large or unusual journals based on our understanding of the business; and challenging the assumptions and judgements made by management in respect of significant accounting estimates. Where observations are raised about management's process or controls surrounding compliance with laws and regulations by us or others, we consider the potential effect of those observations.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor's report.\n\n## Other matters we are required to address\n\n- \u00b7 We were appointed by the Company at its annual general meeting in May 2008 to audit the financial statements of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2008 and subsequent financial periods. Following a competitive tender process, we were reappointed as auditor of the Company for the period ending 31 December 2017 and subsequent financial periods. Our total uninterrupted period of engagement is 16 years, covering periods from our initial appointment through to the period ended 31 December 2023.\n- \u00b7 The audit opinion is consistent with the additional report to the audit committee.\n\n## Use of our report\n\nThis report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Steven Dobson\n\n(Senior statutory auditor) for and on behalf of Ernst & Young LLP, Statutory Auditor London 5 March 2024",

(the 'Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5 of the Parent Company accounts (the 'Group').\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The registered address of Pe\u00f1oles is Calzada Legaria 549, Mexico City 11250. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx. Further information on related-party balances and transactions with Pe\u00f1oles' group companies is disclosed in note 27.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2023 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 4 March 2024.\n\nThe Group's principal business is the mining and beneficiation of non-ferrous minerals, and the sale of related production. The primary contents of this production are silver, gold, lead and zinc. During 2023 99.9% of the production were sold to Pe\u00f1oles' metallurgical complex, Met-Mex (2022: all the production), for smelting and refining. Further information about the Group operating mines and its principal activities is disclosed in note 3.\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a)  Basis of preparation and consolidation, and statement of compliance\n\nBasis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Group consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for trade receivables, derivative financial instruments, equity securities and defined benefit pension scheme assets which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand ($000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out above in the Strategic report on pages 2-167. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows and liquidity position are described in the Financial review in pages 64-75. In addition, note 31 to the financial statements includes the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Group's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company and Group budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2025 (the 'going concern period'). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2023 (US$534.6 million) and the net current asset position (US$1,167.0 million). In addition, they reviewed a more conservative cash flow scenario with reduced silver and gold prices of US$22.8/ounce and US$1,793/ ounce respectively throughout the going concern's period, whilst maintaining current budgeted expenditure while only considering projects approved by the Executive Committee. This resulted in a lower cash position, but still increase the cash balance year on year, maintaining sufficient liquidity throughout the period. Finally, to maintain a strong liquidity, during January 2024, the Company entered into a committed syndicated revolving credit facility (the 'facility') with a maximum amount available of US$350.0 million. The terms of this facility include financial covenants related to leverage and interest cover ratios and the facility is available for a period of five years. Under all going concern scenarios modelled, management forecasts compliance with such covenants.\n\nThe Directors have further calculated prices (US$19.7/ounce and US$1,579/ounce for silver and gold respectively), which should they prevail to the end of 2025 would result in cash balances decreasing to minimal levels by the end of 2025, without applying mitigations.\n\nShould metal prices remain below the stressed prices above for an extended period, management have identified specific elements of capital and exploration expenditures which could be deferred without adversely affecting production profiles throughout the period. On the other hand, management could amend the mining plans to concentrate on production with a higher margin in order to accelerate cash generation without affecting the integrity of the mine plans.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies continued Basis of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements set out the Group's financial position as of 31 December 2023 and 2022, and the results of operations and cash flows for the years then ended.\n\nEntities that constitute the Group are those enterprises controlled by the Group regardless of the number of shares owned by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Entities are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group. The Group applies the acquisition method to account for business combinations in accordance with IFRS 3.\n\nAll intra-group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profits and losses, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated on consolidation. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except that they are only eliminated to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.\n\nNon-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein. The interest of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Subsequent to acquisition, non-controlling interests consist of the amount attributed to such interests at initial recognition and the non-controlling interest's share of changes in equity since the date of the combination. Any losses of a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interests even if that results in a deficit balance.\n\nTransactions with non-controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions - that is, a transaction with the owners in their capacity as owners. The difference between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interest are also recorded in equity.\n\n## (b)  Changes in accounting policies and disclosures\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Group\n\nA number of new or amended standards (the 'Standards') became applicable for the current reporting period. The adoption of these Standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group.\n\nThe Group has evaluated the applicability of Pillar II rules considering that the Parent Company and the main subsidiaries of the Group are tax resident in Mexico, management also assessed the status of the Pillar II legislation in the country, however, no laws or regulations have been enacted to the date of this report.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Group. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c)  Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These judgements and estimates are based on management's best knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the consolidated financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is contained in the accounting policies and/or the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Judgements\n\nAreas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 are:\n\n## Recoverability of Soledad-Dipolos assets:\n\nIn 2009, five members of the El Baj\u00edo agrarian community in the state of Sonora, who claimed rights over certain surface land in the proximity of the operations of Minera Penmont ('Penmont'), submitted a legal claim before the Unitarian Agrarian Court (Tribunal Unitario Agrario) of Hermosillo, Sonora, to have Penmont vacate an area of this surface land. The land in dispute encompassed a portion of surface area where part of the operations of the Soledad-Dipolos mine are located. The litigation resulted in a definitive court order, with which Penmont complied by vacating 1,824 hectares of land in 2013, resulting in the suspension of operations at Soledad-Dipolos. Whilst the claim and the definitive court order did not affect the Group's legal title over the mining concession or the ore currently held in leaching pads near the mine site, land access at the mine site is required to further exploit the concession at Soledad-Dipolos.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\nPenmont is the legal and registered owner of the land where the leaching pads are located but has not yet been able to gain physical access to these pads due to opposition by certain local individuals. This land was purchased by Penmont from the federal government of Mexico in accordance with legal procedures. The Group has a reasonable expectation that Penmont will eventually regain access to the Soledad-Dipolos assets and process the ore content in the Soledad-Dipolos leaching pads. This expectation considers different scenarios, including but not limited to the different legal proceedings that Minera Penmont has presented in order to regain access to the land, and other proceedings that members of the El Baj\u00edo agrarian community have presented seeking the cancellation of Penmont's property deed over this area, which proceedings are pending final resolution. Therefore, the Group continues to recognise property, plant and equipment and inventory related to Soledad-Dipolos, as disclosed in note 13 and note 15, respectively. Due to the fact that it is not yet certain when access may be granted so that the inventory can be processed, this inventory is classified as a non-current asset.\n\nIn regard to the inventory, during the first half of the year the Company identified certain suspected illegal extraction of gold content at its Soledad-Dipolos leaching pads. The Company estimates a loss of approximately 20,000 ounces of gold content and consequently recognised a write-off of US$21.9 million regarding the Soledad-Dipolos gold contents in inventory, which has been presented as other expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement. The Company took relevant actions with the support of diverse authorities to stop the illegal extraction. During the second half of the year, a procedural visit by authorities took place. During the visit of the authorities to the mine site it was confirmed there were no personnel carrying out any illegal mining activities at Soledad-Dipolos leaching pads. Thus, the Company does not currently expect any further losses of this inventory.\n\nThe inventory write-off considered both the estimation of recoverable amount of gold existing at the leaching pad, and potential volume of solution being irrigated on the area that is believed to have been leached to date. However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcome may differ from those estimates.\n\nFurthermore, claimants from the El Baj\u00edo community also presented claims against occupation agreements they entered into with Penmont, covering land parcels other than the surface land where Soledad-Dipolos is located. Penmont has had no significant mining operations or specific geological interest in the affected parcels and these lands are therefore not considered strategic for Penmont. The Agrarian Court has issued rulings declaring such occupation agreements over those land parcels to be null and void and that Penmont must remediate such lands to the state that they were in before Penmont's occupation as well as returning any minerals extracted from this area. The case relating to the claims over these land parcels remains subject to final conclusion, as appeals are progressing as expected. However, given that Penmont has not conducted significant mining operations or had specific geological interest in these land parcels, any contingencies relating to such land parcels are not considered material by the Group. There are no material assets recognised in respect of these land parcels at 31 December 2023.\n\n## Layback Agreement:\n\nIn December 2020, the Group entered into multiple contracts with Orla Mining Ltd. and its Mexican Subsidiary, Minera Camino Rojo, S.A. de C.V. (together herein referred to as 'Orla'), granting Orla the right to expand the Camino Rojo oxide pit onto Fresnillo's 'Guachichil D1' mineral concession. Based on the terms of the contracts, the Group will transfer the legal rights to access and mine the mineral concession to Orla.\n\nThe effectiveness of the agreement was subject to the approval of the Mexican Federal Competition Commission (COFECE), which was granted in February 2021. The consideration includes three payments: US$25.0 million that was received upon the approval of COFECE, US$15.0 million that was received in November 2022 and US$22.8 million that was received in November 2023.\n\nDue to the fact that the contracts were negotiated together, the Group considered the layback contracts as a single agreement (Layback Agreement) for the purpose of determining the accounting implications of the transaction. The Group determined that the transaction should be accounted for as the sale of a single intangible asset. As such, it was relevant to consider the point at which control transfers in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 15 regarding when a performance obligation is satisfied and in light of the continuing performance obligations on the part of the Group. In December 2022 the Group successfully provided the required support to Orla with respect to the negotiations relevant to the acquisition of the rights to access from the local ejido, which was a performance obligation in accordance to the Layback Agreement. Thus, the Company considered at that point that all the obligations established in the Layback Agreement to have been completed and recognised the total value of the agreement (US$67.2 million) in profit or loss as other income.\n\n## Juanicipio project:\n\nCommercial production is the term used for the point at which a mining operation is available for use and capable of operating in the manner intended by management. This generally means that the operation can produce its intended output at stable and sustainable levels. The determination of when a mine reaches commercial production can be complex and judgemental. The Group considered a number of factors when making this judgement, including completion of substantially all construction development activities in accordance with design, a production ramp-up period which achieved an average throughput of 70% of mill nameplate capacity, grades in line with mine plan and recoveries consistent with design.\n\nThe Group assessed the production start date for the mine and the plant separately. The Group had determined that the Juanicipio mine started operations from 1 January 2022. After connecting the plant to the national electricity grid, the Group has concluded that the Juanicipio plant has reached commercial production on 1 June 2023 following a successful commissioning period of the plant and facilities. As commercial production has been achieved, the Group has started to depreciate all the plant assets and recognised the corresponding charge as production cost.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Climate change:\n\nIn the climate disclosure in the Strategic report, the Group's set out its assessment of climate risks and opportunities (CROs). The Group recognises that there may be potential financial statement implications in the future in respect of the mitigation and adaptation measures to the physical and transition risks. The potential effect of climate change would be in respect of assets and liabilities that are measured based on an estimate of future cash flows. The Group specifically considered the effect of climate change on the valuation of property, plant and equipment, deferred tax assets, the Silverstream contract, and the provision for mine closure cost. The Group does not have any assets or liabilities for which measurement is directly linked to climate change performance (for example: Sustainability-Linked Bonds).\n\nThe main ways in which climate has affected the preparation of the financial statements are:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group has already made certain climate-related strategic decisions, such as to focus on decarbonisation and to increase the use of wind energy. Where decisions have been approved by the Board, the effects were considered in the preparation of these financial statements by way of inclusion in future cash flow projections underpinning the estimation of the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment and deferred tax assets, as relevant.\n- \u00b7 As described in note 14, the costs inherent in the Silverstream contract are determined based on the provisions of that contract. This reduces the exposure of the valuation of the asset to the effect of any cost implications related to CROs.\n- \u00b7 Further information about the potential effect of CROs on the provision for mine closure cost is set out in note 21.\n\nThe Group's strategy consists of mitigation and adaptation measures. To mitigate the impacts by and on climate change the Company relies on renewable electricity, fuel replacement and efficiency opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint. The approach to adaptation measures is based on climate models to produce actionable information for the design, construction, operation and closure of its mining assets, considering climate change. In addition, societal expectations are driving government action that may impose further requirements and cost on companies in the future. Future changes to the Group's climate change strategy, global decarbonisation signposts and regulation may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities in future reporting periods. However, as at the balance sheet date the Group believes there is no material impact on balance sheet carrying values of assets or liabilities. Although this is an estimate, it is not considered a critical estimate.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nSignificant areas of estimation uncertainty considered by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements include:\n\nEstimated recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources, note 2 (e):\n\nOre reserves are estimates of the amount of ore that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group's mining properties. Mineral resources are an identified mineral occurrence with reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction. The Group estimates its ore reserves and mineral resources based on information compiled by appropriately-qualified persons relating to the geological and technical data on the size, depth, shape and grade of the ore body and suitable production techniques and recovery rates, in conformity with the Joint Ore Reserves Committee (JORC) code 2012. Such an analysis requires complex geological judgements to interpret the data. The estimation of recoverable ore reserves and mineral resources is based upon factors such as geological assumptions and judgements made in estimating the size and grade of the ore body, estimates of commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, future capital requirements and production costs.\n\nAs additional geological information is produced during the operation of a mine, the economic assumptions used and the estimates of ore reserves and mineral resources may change. Such changes may impact the Group's reported balance sheet and income statement including:\n\n- \u00b7 The carrying value of property, plant and equipment and mining properties may be affected due to changes in the recoverable amount, which consider both ore reserves and mineral resources, refer to note 13.\n- \u00b7 Depreciation and amortisation charges in the income statement may change where such charges are determined using the unit-ofproduction method based on ore reserves, refer to note 13.\n- \u00b7 Stripping costs capitalised in the balance sheet, either as part of mine properties or inventory, or charged to profit or loss may change due to changes in stripping ratios, refer to note 13.\n- \u00b7 Provisions for mine closure costs may change where changes to the ore reserve and resources estimates affect expectations about when such activities will occur, refer to note 21.\n- \u00b7 The recognition and carrying value of deferred income tax assets may change due to changes regarding the existence of such assets and in estimates of the likely recovery of such assets, refer to note 11.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## Estimate of recoverable ore on leaching pads, note 15:\n\nIn the Group's open pit mines, certain mined ore is placed on leaching pads where a solution is applied to the surface of the heap to dissolve the gold and enable extraction. The determination of the amount of recoverable gold requires estimation with consideration of the quantities of ore placed on the pads, the grade of the ore (based on assay data) and the estimated recovery percentage (based on metallurgical studies and current technology).\n\nThe grades of ore placed on pads are regularly compared to the quantities of metal recovered through the leaching process to evaluate the appropriateness of the estimated recovery (metallurgical balancing). The Group monitors the results of the metallurgical balancing process and recovery estimates are refined based on actual results over time and when new information becomes available.\n\nThe Group monitors the metallurgical balances to confirm the grade and recovery of the ore in inventories. Based on new technical information and the reconsideration of actual recovery grades and updated leaching targets, the Group updated its estimate of gold content in leaching pads increasing this by 30.7 thousand ounces of gold as at 1 January 2023.\n\nThis change in estimation was incorporated prospectively in inventory from 1 January 2023. The increase in the number of ounces reduced the weighted average cost of inventory. Had the estimation not changed, production cost during 2023 would have been US$30.9 million higher, with an offsetting impact against the work-in-progress inventory balance as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Silverstream, note 14:\n\nThe valuation of the Silverstream contract as a derivative financial instrument requires estimation by management. The term of the derivative is based on the Sabinas life of mine and the value of this derivative is determined using a number of estimates, including the estimated recoverable ore reserves and a portion of mineral resources considering the expected rate of conversion to reserves and future production profile of the Sabinas mine on the same basis a market participant would consider, the estimated recoveries of silver from ore mined, estimates of the future price of silver and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. Further detail on the inputs that have a significant effect on the fair value of this derivative, and the impact of changes in key assumptions are included in note 14.\n\n## Income tax, notes 2 (q) and 11:\n\nThe recognition of deferred tax assets, including those arising from un-utilised tax losses, requires management to assess the likelihood that the Group will generate taxable earnings in future periods, in order to utilise recognised deferred tax assets. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecast cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. Estimated cash flows are not significantly sensitive to reasonable possible changes to key assumptions on which management bases the recoverable value calculations. The carrying value of deferred tax assets is disclosed in note 11.\n\n## (d)  Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Group's consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the Parent Company's functional currency. The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates. The determination of functional currency requires management judgement, particularly where there may be more than one currency in which transactions are undertaken and which impact the economic environment in which the entity operates. For all operating entities, this is US dollars.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Nonmonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value is determined.\n\nFor entities with functional currencies other than US dollars as at the reporting date, assets and liabilities are translated into the reporting currency of the Group by applying the exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the income statement is translated at the average exchange rate for the year. The resulting difference on exchange is included as a cumulative translation adjustment in other comprehensive income. On disposal of an entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that operation is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (e)  Property, plant and equipment\n\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into working condition for its intended use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.\n\nThe cost less the residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life. Each item's estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property at which the item is located. Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items. Depreciation is charged to cost of sales on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis for mine buildings and installations, plant and equipment used in the mine production process (except mobile equipment) or on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the individual asset that are not related to the mine production process. Changes in estimates, which mainly affect unit-of-production calculations, are accounted for prospectively. Depreciation commences when assets are available for use. Land is not depreciated.",

Any gain or loss arising at de-recognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year that the asset is de-recognised.\n\nNon-current assets or disposal groups are classified as held for sale when it is expected that the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered principally through sale rather than through continuing use. Assets are not depreciated when classified as held for sale.\n\n## Disposal of assets\n\nGains or losses from the disposal of assets are recognised in the income statement when all significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, usually when title has been passed.\n\n## Mining properties and development costs\n\nPayments for mining concessions are expensed during the exploration phase of a prospect and capitalised during the development of the project when incurred.\n\nPurchased rights to ore reserves and mineral resources are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition or at fair value if purchased as part of a business combination.\n\nMining concessions, when capitalised, are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of time in which benefits are expected to be obtained from that specific concession.\n\nMine development costs are capitalised as part of property, plant and equipment. Mine development activities commence once a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project. When an exploration prospect has entered into the advanced exploration phase and sufficient evidence of the probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals has been obtained pre-operative expenses relating to mine preparation works are also capitalised as a mine development cost.\n\nThe initial cost of a mining property comprises its construction cost, any costs directly attributable to bringing the mining property into operation, the initial estimate of the provision for mine closure cost, and, for qualifying assets, borrowing costs. The Group cease the capitalisation of borrowing cost when the physical construction of the asset is complete and is ready for its intended use.\n\nOre generated as part of the development stage may be processed and sold, giving rise to revenue before the commencement of commercial production. Where such processing is necessary to bring mining assets into the condition required for their intended use (for example, in testing the plants at the mining unit in development), revenues from metals recovered from such activities are recognised in profit or loss.\n\nUpon commencement of production, capitalised expenditure is depreciated using the unit-of-production method based on the estimated economically-proven and probable reserves to which they relate.\n\nMining properties and mine development are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and impairment in value, if any.\n\n## Construction in progress\n\nAssets in the course of construction are capitalised as a separate component of property, plant and equipment. On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment. The cost of construction in progress is not depreciated.\n\n## Subsequent expenditures\n\nAll subsequent expenditure on property, plant and equipment is capitalised if it meets the recognition criteria, and the carrying amount of those parts that are replaced, is de-recognised. All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## Stripping costs\n\nIn a surface mine operation, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste material in order to gain access to the ore bodies (stripping activity). During development and pre-production phases, the stripping activity costs are capitalised as part of the initial cost of development and construction of the mine (the stripping activity asset) and charged as depreciation or depletion to cost of sales, in the income statement, based on the mine's units of production once commercial operations begin.\n\nRemoval of waste material normally continues throughout the life of a surface mine. At the time that saleable material begins to be extracted from the surface mine the activity is referred to as production stripping.\n\nProduction stripping cost is capitalised only if the following criteria are met:\n\n- \u00b7 It is probable that the future economic benefits (improved access to an ore body) associated with the stripping activity will flow to the Group.\n- \u00b7 The Group can identify the component of an ore body for which access has been improved.\n- \u00b7 The costs relating to the improved access to that component can be measured reliably.\n\nIf not all of the criteria are met, the production stripping costs are charged to the income statement as operating costs as they are incurred.\n\nStripping activity costs associated with such development activities are capitalised into existing mining development assets, as mining properties and development cost, within property, plant and equipment, using a measure that considers the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume, for a given volume of ore production. This measure is known as 'component stripping ratio', which is revised annually in accordance with the mine plan. The amount capitalised is subsequently depreciated over the expected useful life of the identified component of the ore body related to the stripping activity asset, by using the units of production method. The identification of components and the expected useful lives of those components are evaluated as new information of reserves and resources is available.\n\nThe capitalised stripping activity asset is carried at cost less accumulated depletion/depreciation, less impairment, if any. Cost includes the accumulation of costs directly incurred to perform the stripping activity that improves access to the identified component of ore, plus an allocation of directly attributable overhead costs. The costs associated with incidental operations are excluded from the cost of the stripping activity asset.\n\n## (f)  Impairment of non-financial assets\n\nThe carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. At each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount. Such reviews are undertaken on an asset by asset basis, except where such assets do not generate cash flows independent of those from other assets or groups of assets, and then the review is undertaken at the cash-generating unit level.\n\nIf the carrying amount of an asset or its cash generating unit exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the recoverable amount in the balance sheet. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.\n\n## The recoverable amount of an asset\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. In assessing value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The cash flows used to determine the recoverable amount of mining assets are based on the mine plan for each mine. The mine plan is determined based on the estimated and economically-proven and probable reserves, as well as certain other resources that are assessed as highly likely to be converted into reserves. Fair value less cost of disposal is based on an estimate of the amount that the Group may obtain in an orderly sale transaction between market participants. For an asset that does not generate cash inflows largely independently of those from other assets, or groups of assets, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. The Group's cash-generating units are the smallest identifiable groups of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.\n\n## Reversal of impairment\n\nAn assessment is made each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the recoverable amount. That increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in previous years. Such impairment loss reversal is recognised in the income statement.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (g)  Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Group classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at FVOCI; and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at fair value through profit or loss.\n\nThe classification depends on the Group's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Group has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at FVOCI.\n\nThe Group reclassifies debt investments when and only when its business model for managing those assets changes.\n\nPurchases or sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within a time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular way trades) are recognised on the trade date, i.e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Group measures a financial asset at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial asset not at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL), transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Transaction costs of financial assets carried at FVPL are expensed in profit or loss.\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Group holds the following financial assets:\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is derecognised, modified or impaired.\n\nThe Group's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at fair value through profit and loss).\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Group can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the statement of profit or loss when the right of payment has been established, except when the Group benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at fair value through OCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Group elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the statement of profit or loss as applicable.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables and derivative financial instruments, including the Silverstream contract, are classified as fair value through profit or loss.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## De-recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nThe Group assesses on a forward-looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its debt instruments carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk.\n\nFor receivables (other than trade receivables which are measured at FVPL), the Group applies the simplified approach permitted by IFRS 9, which requires expected lifetime losses to be recognised from initial recognition of the receivables.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nThe Group classifies its financial liabilities as follows:\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Group's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Group are classified as financial liabilities as amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## De-recognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\n## (h)  Inventories\n\nFinished goods, work-in-progress and ore stockpile inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined using the weighted average cost method based on cost of production which excludes borrowing costs.\n\nFor this purpose, the costs of production include:\n\n- \u00b7 personnel expenses, which include employee profit sharing;\n- \u00b7 materials and contractor expenses which are directly attributable to the extraction and processing of ore;\n- \u00b7 the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the extraction and processing of ore; and\n- \u00b7 related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity).\n\nWork-in-progress inventory comprises ore in leaching pads as processing is required to extract benefit from the ore. The recovery of gold is achieved through the heap leaching process. The leaching process may take months to obtain the expected metal recovery and mainly depends on the continuity of the leaching process. When the ore in leaching pads is in active leaching, it is classified as current. When the leaching process has stopped and not expected to restart within 12 months, ore in the leaching pads affected is classified as non-current.\n\nOperating materials and spare parts are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. An allowance for obsolete and slow-moving inventories is determined by reference to specific items of stock. A regular review is undertaken by management to determine the extent of such an allowance.\n\nNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.\n\n## (i)  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (j)  Provisions\n\n## Mine closure cost\n\nA provision for mine closure cost is made in respect of the estimated future costs of closure, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs (which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas) based on a mine closure plan, in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs. The provision is discounted and the unwinding of the discount is included within finance costs. At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future economic benefit and is depreciated over future production considering proven and probable reserves from the mine to which it relates. The provision is reviewed on an annual basis by the Group for changes in cost estimates, discount rates or life of operations based on the estimated mine production which includes ore reserves and a certain amount of mineral resources. Changes to estimated future costs are recognised in the balance sheet by adjusting the mine closure cost liability and the related asset originally recognised. If, for mature mines, the revised mine assets net of mine closure cost provisions exceed the recoverable value, the portion of the increase is charged directly as an expense. For closed sites, changes to estimated costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.\n\n## (k)  Employee benefits\n\nThe Group operates the following plans for its employees based on Mexico:\n\n## Defined benefit pension plan\n\nThis funded plan is based on each employee's earnings and years of service. This plan was open to all employees in Mexico until it was closed to new entrants on 1 July 2007. The plan is denominated in Mexican pesos. For members as at 30 June 2007, benefits were frozen at that date subject to indexation with reference to the Mexican National Consumer Price Index (NCPI).\n\nThe present value of defined benefit obligations under the plan is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. The discount rate is the yield on bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Group's obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\nPast service costs are recognised when the plan amendment or curtailment occurs and when the entity recognises related restructuring costs or termination benefits.\n\nThe defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly. The value of any asset is restricted to the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in the future contributions to the plan.\n\nNet interest cost is recognised within finance cost and return on plan assets (other than amounts reflected in net interest cost) is recognised in OCI and permanently excluded from profit or loss.\n\n## Defined contribution pension plan\n\nA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due. The contributions are based on the employee's salary.\n\nThis plan started on 1 July 2007 and it is voluntary for all employees to join this scheme.\n\n## Seniority premium for voluntary separation\n\nThis unfunded plan corresponds to an additional payment over the legal seniority premium equivalent to approximately 12 days of salary per year for those unionised workers who have more than 15 years of service. Non-unionised employees with more than 15 years of service have the right to a payment equivalent to 12 days for each year of service. For both cases, the payment is based on the legal current minimum salary.\n\nThe cost of providing benefits for the seniority premium for voluntary separation is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method and prepared by an external actuarial firm as at each year-end balance sheet date. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised as income or expense in the period in which they occur.\n\n## Other\n\nBenefits for death and disability are covered through insurance policies.\n\nTermination payments for involuntary retirement (dismissals) are charged to the income statement, when incurred.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## (l)  Employee profit sharing\n\nIn accordance with the Mexican legislation, companies in Mexico are subject to pay for employee profit sharing (PTU) equivalent to ten percent of the taxable income of each fiscal year capped to three months of salary or average of the profit sharing paid in the last three years.\n\nPTU is accounted for as employee benefits and is calculated based on the services rendered by employees during the year, considering their most recent salaries. The liability is recognised as it accrues and is charged to the income statement. PTU, paid in each fiscal year, is deductible for income tax purposes.\n\n## (m)  Leases\n\n## Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group assesses at contract inception whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. That is, if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nAssets and liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured on a present value basis. Lease liabilities include the net present value of the following lease payments:\n\n- \u00b7 fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable variable lease payment that are based on an index or a rate;\n- \u00b7 amounts expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;\n- \u00b7 the exercise price of a purchase option if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that option; and\n- \u00b7 payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising that option.\n\nThe lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate cannot be determined, the lessee's incremental borrowing rate is used, being the rate that the lessee would have to pay to borrow the funds necessary to obtain an asset of similar value in a similar economic environment with similar terms and conditions.\n\nRight-of-use assets are measured at cost comprising the following:\n\n- \u00b7 the amount of the initial measurement of lease liability;\n- \u00b7 any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n- \u00b7 any initial direct costs; and\n- \u00b7 restoration costs.\n\nEach lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. The right-of-use asset is depreciated over the shorter of the asset's useful life and the lease term on a straight-line basis.\n\nThe Group is exposed to potential future increases in variable lease payments based on an index or rate, which are not included in the lease liability until they take effect. When adjustments to lease payments based on an index or rate take effect, the lease liability is reassessed and adjusted against the right-of-use asset.\n\nVariable lease payments that are not linked to price changes due to changes in a market rate or the value of an index and are linked to future performance or use of an underlying asset are not included in the measurement of the lease liability. Such costs are recognised in profit and loss as incurred.\n\nPayments associated with short-term leases and leases of low-value assets are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit or loss. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Low-value assets comprise IT-equipment.\n\n## (n)  Revenue from contracts with customers\n\nRevenue is recognised when control of goods or services transfers to the customers based on the performance obligations settle in the contracts with customers.\n\n## Sale of goods\n\nRevenue associated with the sale of concentrates, dor\u00e9, slag, precipitates and activated carbon (the products) is recognised when control of the asset sold is transferred to the customers. Indicators of control transferring include an unconditional obligation to pay, legal title, physical possession, transfer of risk and rewards and customers acceptance. This generally occurs when the goods are delivered to the customer's smelter or refinery agreed with the buyer; at which point the buyer controls the goods. Inventory in transit to the smelter or refinery does not represent a significant proportion of total revenue at the end of the reporting period given the distance to the mine units.\n\nThe revenue is measured at the amount to which the Group expects to be entitled, being the estimate of the price expected to be received in the expected month of settlement and the Group's estimate of metal quantities based on assay data, and a corresponding trade receivable is recognised. Any future changes that occur before settlement are embedded within the provisionally-priced trade receivables and are, therefore, within the scope of IFRS 9 and not within the scope of IFRS 15.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\nGiven the exposure to the commodity price, these provisionally-priced trade receivables will fail the cash flow characteristics test within IFRS 9 and will be required to be measured at fair value through profit or loss up from initial recognition and until the date of settlement. These subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in revenue but separately from revenue from contracts with customers.\n\nInvoiced revenues to our customers for products other than refined silver and gold, are derived from the value of metal content which is determined by commodity market prices and adjusted for the treatment and refining charges to be incurred by the metallurgical complex of our customers. Refining and treatment charges represent an element of the cost that will be incurred by our customers in processing the products further to extract the metal content for onward sale to its customers (see note 5 (c)).\n\n## (o)  Exploration expenses\n\nExploration activity involves the search for mineral resources, the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercial viability of an identified resource.\n\nExploration expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred and are recorded in the following captions: \u00b7 Cost of sales:\n\n- -costs relating to in-mine exploration, that ensure continuous extraction quality and extend mine life, and\n- \u00b7 Exploration expenses:\n- -Costs incurred in geographical proximity to existing mines in order to replenish or increase reserves.\n- -Costs incurred in regional exploration with the objective of locating new ore deposits, which are identified by project, in areas\n- where the Group carriers out exploration activity. Currently the Group carries out exploration activities in Mexico and Latin America.\n- -Costs incurred are charged to the income statement until there is sufficient probability of the existence of economically recoverable minerals and a feasibility study has been performed for the specific project from which time further expenses are capitalised as exploration costs on balance sheet as property, plant and equipment.\n\n## (p)  Selling expenses\n\nThe Group recognises in selling expenses a levy in respect of the Extraordinary Mining Right as sales of gold and silver are recognised. The Extraordinary Mining Right consists of a 0.5% rate, applicable to the owners of mining titles. The payment must be calculated over the total sales of all mining concessions. The payment of this mining right must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year and can be credited against corporate income tax.\n\nThe Group also recognises in selling expenses a discovery premium royalty equivalent to 1% of the value of the mineral extracted and sold during the year from certain mining titles granted by the Mexican Geological Survey (SGM) in the San Juli\u00e1n mine. The premium is settled to SGM on a quarterly basis.\n\n## (q)  Taxation\n\n## Current income tax\n\nCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the country the Group operates.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.",

The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities on temporary differences arising in the determination of the Special Mining Right (see note 11).\n\n## Sales tax\n\nExpenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax, except when the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case, the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item. The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.\n\n## (r)  Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Group uses derivatives to reduce certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodities price which impact its financial and business transactions. Hedges are designed to protect the value of expected production against the dynamic market conditions.\n\nSuch derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative. The full fair value of a derivative is classified as non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the item is more than 12 months.\n\nAny gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement as finance income or finance cost respectively.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency and commodity contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles, European foreign exchange and commodity options are valued using the Black Scholes model. The Silverstream contract is valued using a Net Present Value valuation approach.\n\nThe documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess whether the hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements (including the analysis of sources of hedge ineffectiveness and how the hedge ratio is determined). A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting if it meets all of the following effectiveness requirements:\n\n- \u00b7 There is 'an economic relationship' between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n- \u00b7 The effect of credit risk does not 'dominate the value changes' that result from that economic relationship.\n- \u00b7 The hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the Group actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the Group actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.\n\nHedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as cash flow hedges.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies continued\n\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative instruments is recorded as in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. For gains or losses related to the hedging of foreign exchange risk these are included, in the line item in which the hedged costs are reflected. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. This is not a reclassification adjustment and will not be recognised in OCI for the period. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recognised directly as finance costs, in the income statement of the related period.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss recognised directly in other comprehensive income from the period that the hedge was effective remains separately in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs, when it is recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.\n\nWhen hedging with options, the Group designates only the intrinsic value movement of the hedging option within the hedge relationship. The time value of the option contracts is therefore excluded from the hedge designation. In such cases, changes in the time value of options are initially recognised in OCI as a cost of hedging. Where the hedged item is transaction-related, amounts initially recognised in OCI related to the change in the time value of options are reclassified to profit or loss or as a basis adjustment to nonfinancial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedged item that realises over time, the amounts initially recognised in OCI are amortised to profit or loss on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\nWhen hedging with forward contracts, the forward element is included in the designation of the financial instrument. Therefore, there is no cost of hedging in relation to forward contracts.\n\n## (s)  Borrowing costs\n\nBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes 12 or more months to get ready for its intended use or sale (a qualifying asset) are capitalised as part of the cost of the respective asset. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.\n\nWhere funds are borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where surplus funds are available for a short term from funds borrowed specifically to finance a project, the income generated from the temporary investment of such amounts is also capitalised and deducted from the total capitalised borrowing cost. Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the Group during the period.\n\nAll other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.\n\n## (t)  Fair value measurement\n\nThe Group measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in note 30 (b).\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 in the principal market for the asset or liability, or;\n- \u00b7 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Group.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\nGovernance\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Group has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 30.\n\n## (u)  Dividend distribution\n\nDividends on the Company's Ordinary Shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company's discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\n## 3.  Segment reporting\n\nFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on producing mines.\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the Group has seven reportable operating segments as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 the Fresnillo mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 the Saucito mine, located in the state of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine;\n- \u00b7 the Ci\u00e9nega mine, located in the state of Durango, an underground silver-gold mine;\n- \u00b7 the Herradura mine, located in the state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 the Noche Buena mine, located in state of Sonora, a surface gold mine;\n- \u00b7 the San Juli\u00e1n mine, located on the border of Chihuahua/Durango states, an underground silver-gold mine; and\n- \u00b7 the Juanicipio mine, in the State of Zacatecas, an underground silver mine.\n\nThe operating performance and financial results for each of these mines are reviewed by management. As the Group's chief operating decision-maker (CODM) does not review segment assets and liabilities, the Group has not disclosed this information.\n\nManagement monitors the results of its operating segments separately for the purpose of performance assessment and making decisions about resource allocation. Segment performance is evaluated without taking into account certain adjustments included in revenue as reported in the consolidated income statement, and certain costs included within cost of sales and gross profit which are considered to be outside of the control of the operating management of the mines. The table on page 282 provides a reconciliation from segment profit to gross profit as per the consolidated income statement. Administrative expenses, exploration expenses, selling expenses, and other income and expenses not related to production activities included in the consolidated income statement are not allocated to operating segments. Also, the Group's financing (including finance cost and finance income) and income taxes are managed on a Group basis and are not allocated to operating segments. Transactions between reportable segments are accounted for on an arm's-length basis similar to transactions with third parties.\n\nIn 2023 99.9% of revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico (2022: all revenue was derived from customers based in Mexico).",

and (ii) the deduction of exploration expenses.\n\nThese amendments were applied to tax returns from 2014 to 2021 (for the year 2021 the amendment also included Minera Penmont as the merging entity of Desarrollos Mineros Fresne) and resulted in an increase in the current corporate income tax charge of US$3.2 million and current special mining right charge of US$2.7 million and a recoverable income tax balance of US$3.2 million. This effect was offset by a decrease in deferred corporate income tax of US$3.4 million. The amendment also resulted in US$11.5 million of interest and surcharges presented in finance costs.",

|\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the same fiscal authority.\n\nBased on management's internal forecast, a deferred tax asset of US$141.1 million (2022: US$117.7 million) has been recognised in respect of tax losses amounting to US$470.3 million (2022: US$391.6 million). If not utilised, US$7.1 million (2022: US$33.2 million) will expire within five years and US$463.2 million (2022: US$358.4 million) will expire between six and ten years. Of the total deferred tax asset related to losses, US$69.4 million (2022: US$34.4 million) is covered by the existence of taxable temporary differences, the remaining US$71.7 million (2022: US$83.3 million) corresponds to Fresnillo plc which maintained a deferred net asset position. Despite the accounting loss in the Parent Company in the current and prior periods, management has considered the taxable profit generated in the current year of US$91.3 million and based on a consideration of this, combined with future financial and tax projections, considers that there is evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which these unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\nThe Group has also performed an assessment of the recoverability of tax losses from mining entities based on financial projections that are consistent with the Group's impairment assessment (refer to note 13), together with relevant tax projections which consider the amount and timing of certain tax deductions. Based on those assumptions, the Group expects to fully utilise its recognised losses.\n\nThe Group has further tax losses and other similar attributes carried forward of US$112.3 million (2022: US$91.9 million) on which no deferred tax is recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits. Based on the applicable tax legislation the tax losses are not subject to expiry.\n\n## (d)  Unrecognised deferred tax on investments in subsidiaries\n\nThe Group has not recognised all of the deferred tax liability in respect of distributable reserves of its subsidiaries because it controls them and only part of the temporary differences is expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,015 million (2022: US$1,006 million).",

The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.\n\nOn 30 December 2018, the Decree of tax incentives for the northern border region of Mexico was published in the Official Gazette, which provided a reduction of income tax by a third and also a reduction of 50% of the value added tax rate, for taxpayers that produce income from business activities carried out within the northern border region. The tax incentives were applicable since 1 January 2019 and remained in force until 31 December 2020. On 30 December 2020 and extension of the Decree was published in the Official Gazette which remains in force until 31 December 2024. Some of the Group companies which produce income from business activities carried out within Caborca, Sonora, which is considered for purposes of the Decree as northern border region, applied for this Decree tax incentives before the Mexican tax authorities, and were granted authorisation for income tax and value added tax purposes.\n\nThe special mining right 'SMR' states that the owners of mining titles and concessions are subject to pay an annual mining right of 7.5% of the profit derived from the extractive activities and is considered as income tax under IFRS. The 7.5% tax applies to a base of income before interest, annual inflation adjustment, taxes paid on the regular activity, depreciation and amortisation, as defined by the new ISR. This SMR can be credited against the corporate income tax of the same fiscal year and its payment must be remitted no later than the last business day of March of the following year.\n\n## 12.

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\nDuring the year ended 31 December 2023, the Group capitalised US$2.1 million of borrowing costs paid within construction in progress (2022: US$8.6 million). Borrowing costs were capitalised at the rate of 5.02% (2022: 5.02%).\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs disclosed in note 2 (f) management performs at each reporting date an assessment to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. As at 31 December 2023, the carrying amounts of mining assets is supported by their recoverable values.\n\nThe key assumptions on which management bases the recoverable value calculations of the mining assets are commodity prices, future capital requirements, production costs, reserves and resources volumes (reflected in production volumes) and discount rate.\n\nThe models are most sensitive to changes in commodity price assumptions, operating costs and production volumes.\n\nOther than as disclosed below, management has considered no reasonably possible change in any other key assumption above would cause the carrying value of any of its mining assets to exceed its recoverable amount.\n\nIn the absence of any changes to any of the other key assumptions, a change in the below assumptions would have the following impact as at 31 December 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 A decrease of 10% in gold and silver prices would result in an impairment charge of US$228.7 million.\n- \u00b7 An increase of 10% in operating costs would result in an impairment charge of US$116.1 million.\n- \u00b7 A decrease of 5% in the forecasted volume of gold and silver produced would result in an impairment charge of US$92.2 million.\n\n## 14.  Silverstream contract\n\nOn 31 December 2007, the Group entered into an agreement with Pe\u00f1oles through which the Group is entitled to receive the proceeds received by the Pe\u00f1oles Group in respect of the refined silver sold from the Sabinas Mine ('Sabinas'), a base-metals mine owned and operated by the Pe\u00f1oles Group. The agreement required an upfront payment of US$350 million by Fresnillo. In addition, a per ounce cash payment of US$2.00 in years one to five and US$5.00 thereafter (subject to an inflationary adjustment that commenced from 31 December 2013) is payable to Pe\u00f1oles. The cash payment to Pe\u00f1oles per ounce of silver for the year ended 31 December 2023 was US$5.65 per ounce (2022: US$5.54 per ounce). Under the contract, the Group has the option to receive a net cash settlement from Pe\u00f1oles attributable to the silver produced and sold from Sabinas, to take delivery of an equivalent amount of refined silver or to receive settlement in the form of both cash and silver. If, by 31 December 2032, the amount of silver produced by Sabinas is less than 60 million ounces, a further payment is due from Pe\u00f1oles to the Group of US$1 per ounce of shortfall.\n\nThe Silverstream contract represents a derivative financial instrument which has been recorded at FVPL and classified within non-current and current assets as appropriate. The term of the derivative is based on Sabinas' life of mine which is currently 24 years considering ore reserves and certain mineral resources based on the expected conversion rate to reserves. Changes in the contract's fair value, other than those represented by the realisation of the asset through the receipt of either cash or refined silver, are charged or credited to the income statement. In the year ended 31 December 2023 total proceeds received in cash were US$40.2 million (2022: US$33.4 million) of which, US$8.3 million was in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2022 (2022: US$4.8 million in respect of proceeds receivable as at 31 December 2021). Cash received in respect of the year of US$31.8 million (2022: US$28.5 million) corresponds to 2.29 million ounces of payable silver (2022: 2.06 million ounces). As at 31 December 2023, a further US$5.1 million (2022: US$8.3 million) of cash receivable corresponding to 278,342 ounces of silver is due (2022: 453,158 ounces).\n\nA reconciliation of the beginning balance to the ending balance is shown below:\n\n|                                                   | 2023  US$ thousands   | 2022  US$ thousands   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n| Balance at 1 January                              | 511,474               | 529,544               |\n| Cash received in respect of the year              | (31,816)              | (28,513)              |\n| Cash receivable                                   | (5,050)               | (8,342)               |\n| Remeasurement gains recognised in profit and loss | 7,732                 | 18,785                |\n| Balance at 31 December                            | 482,340               | 511,474               |\n| Less - Current portion                            | 35,802                | 36,218                |\n| Non-current portion                               | 446,538               | 475,256               |\n\nThe US$7.7 million unrealised gain recorded in the income statement (31 December 2022: US$18.8 million loss) resulted mainly from the financial profit obtained from the contract amortisation, which was partially compensated with lower reserves considered in the production mine plan and a lower inflation rate expected.",

This derivative has a term of 24 years and the valuation model utilises several inputs that are not based on observable market data due to the nature of these inputs and/or the duration of the contract. Inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine over the contract life, the future price of silver, future inflation and the discount rate used to discount future cash flows. In line with what a market participant would consider, the model includes the proportion of resources that are expected to be converted into reserves. Out of the 82.8 moz included in the model, 56% relates to reserves and 44% relates to resources (which were adjusted by a conversion factor of 50%). (2022: 55% and 45% respectively). For purposes of the fair value measurement, those resources are assumed to be mined once reserves are exhausted. This approach has been applied consistently in both 2023 and 2022.\n\nThe estimate of the volume of silver that will be produced and sold from the Sabinas mine requires estimates of the recoverable silver reserves and resources, the related production profile based on the Sabinas mine plan and the expected recovery of silver from ore mined. The estimation of these inputs is subject to a range of operating assumptions and may change over time. Estimates of reserves and resources are updated annually by Pe\u00f1oles, the operator and sole interest holder in the Sabinas mine and provided to the Company. The production profile and estimated payable silver that will be recovered from ore mined is based on the operational mine plan, with certain amendments to reflect a basis that a market participant would consider, that is provided to the Company by Pe\u00f1oles. The inputs assume no interruption in production over the life of the Silverstream contract and production levels which are consistent with those achieved in recent years.\n\nManagement regularly assesses a range of reasonably possible alternatives for those significant unobservable inputs described above and determines their impact on the total fair value. The fair value of the Silverstream contract is significantly sensitive to a reasonably possible change in future silver price, the discount rate used to discount future cash flows and total recoverable reserves and resources over the life of mine. The sensitivity of these key inputs is as follows:\n\n|                        | Commodity price                        | Commodity price                                                     | Discount rate                                        | Discount rate                                                       | Volumes produced                                  | Volumes produced                                                    |\n|------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December | Increase/  (decrease) in  silver price | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands | Basis point  increase/  (decrease)  in interest rate | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands | Increase/  (decrease) in  reserves and  resources | Effect on profit  before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands |\n| 2023                   | 10%                                    | 63,222                                                              | -                                                    | -                                                                   | 10%                                               | 48,141                                                              |\n|                        | (10%)                                  | (63,222)                                                            | (75)                                                 | 27,473                                                              | (10%)                                             | (48,141)                                                            |\n| 2022                   | 20%                                    | 133,736                                                             | 100                                                  | (41,860)                                                            | 6%                                                | 30,600                                                              |\n|                        | (15%)                                  | (100,302)                                                           | (25)                                                 | 11,452                                                              | (6%)                                              | (30,600)                                                            |\n\nManagement considers that an appropriate sensitivity for volumes produced and sold is on the total recoverable reserve and resource quantities over the contract term rather than annual production volumes over the mine life.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs are not interrelated. The Sabinas mine is a polymetallic mine that contains copper, lead and zinc as well as silver, which is produced as a by-product. Therefore, changes to base metals prices (rather than the price of silver) are most relevant to the Sabinas mine production plans and the overall economic assessment of the mine.\n\nThe effects on profit before tax and equity of reasonably possible changes to the inflation rates and the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso on the Silverstream contract are not material. The Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.",

These deferred costs of hedging are either reclassified to profit or loss or recognised as a basis adjustment to non-financial assets or liabilities upon maturity of the hedged item, or, in the case of a hedge item that realises over time, amortised on a systematic and rational basis over the life of the hedged item.\n\n## Fair value reserve of financial assets at FVOCI\n\nThe Group has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain investments in equity securities in OCI, as explained in note 2 (g). These changes are accumulated within the FVOCI reserve within equity. The Group transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are derecognised.\n\n## Foreign currency translation reserve\n\nThe foreign currency translation reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial information of entities with a functional currency different to that of the presentational currency of the Group.\n\n## Retained earnings\n\nThis reserve records the accumulated results of the Group, less any distributions and dividends paid.\n\n## 19.

Interest-bearing loans\n\n## Senior Notes\n\nOn 13 November 2013, the Group completed its offering of US$800 million aggregate principal amount of 5.500% Senior Notes due November 2023 (the 5.500% Notes). On 29 September 2020, the Group repurchased certain of its 5.500% Notes that had a carrying value of US$482.1 million for a consideration of US$543.0 million.\n\nOn 2 October 2020, the Group completed its offering of US$850 million aggregate principal amount of 4.250% Senior Notes due 2050 in the Irish Stock Exchange. The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nOn 13 November 2023, the Company paid the outstanding amount of the 5.500% Notes at its maturity date including due interest for a total of US$326.6 million.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2023  US$ thousands | 2022 US$ thousands  |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,158,557           | 1,157,545           |\n| Payments of 5.500% Notes                       | (317,879)           | -                   |\n| Accrued interest                               | 53,919              | 56,475              |\n| Interest paid 1                                | (56,371)            | (56,371)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 776                 | 908                 |\n| Closing balance                                | 839,002             | 1,158,557           |\n| Less - Current portion                         | -                   | 317,879             |\n| Non-current portion                            | 839,002             | 840,678             |\n\nThe Group has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the senior notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Group is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Group shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Group may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 21.  Provision for mine closure cost\n\nThe provision represents the discounted values of the risk-adjusted estimated cost to decommission and rehabilitate the mines at the estimated date of depletion of mine deposits. Uncertainties in estimating these costs include potential changes in regulatory requirements, decommissioning, dismantling and reclamation alternatives, timing; the effects of climate change, and the discount, foreign exchange and inflation rates applied. Closure provisions are typically based on conceptual level studies that are refreshed at least every three years. As these studies are renewed, they incorporate greater consideration of forecast climate conditions at closure.\n\nThe Group has performed separate calculations of the provision by currency, discounting at corresponding rates. As at 31 December 2023, the discount rates used in the calculation of the parts of the provision that relate to Mexican pesos range from 9.87% to 11.19% (2022: range from 10.08% to 10.62%). The range for the current year parts that relate to US dollars range from 3.70% to 4.68% (2022: range from 3.08% to 4.44%).\n\nMexican regulations regarding the decommissioning and rehabilitation of mines are limited and less developed in comparison to regulations in many other jurisdictions. It is the Group's intention to rehabilitate the mines beyond the requirements of Mexican law, and estimated costs reflect this level of expense. The Group intends to fully rehabilitate the affected areas at the end of the lives of the mines.",

Pensions and other post-employment benefit plans\n\nThe Group has a defined contribution plan and a defined benefit plan.\n\nThe defined contribution plan was established as from 1 July 2007 and consists of periodic contributions made by each Mexican non-unionised worker and contributions made by the Group to the fund matching workers' contributions, capped at 8% of the employee's annual salary.\n\nThe defined benefit plan provides pension benefits based on each worker's earnings and years of services provided by personnel hired up to 30 June 2007 as well as statutory seniority premiums for both unionised and non-unionised workers.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's defined benefit plan is guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with contributions, ensures that there will be sufficient assets to pay pension benefits and statutory seniority premiums for non-unionised workers as they fall due while also mitigating the various risks of the plan. However, the portion of the plan related to statutory seniority premiums for unionised workers is not funded. The investment strategies for the plan are generally managed under local laws and regulations. The actual asset allocation is determined by current and expected economic and market conditions and in consideration of specific asset class risk in the risk profile. Within this framework, the Group ensures that the trustees consider how the asset investment strategy correlates with the maturity profile of the plan liabilities and the respective potential impact on the funded status of the plan, including potential short-term liquidity requirements.\n\nDeath and disability benefits are covered through insurance policies.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## (b)  The Group as a lessor\n\nOperating leases, in which the Group is the lessor, relate to mobile equipment owned by the Group with lease terms of between 12 to 36 months. All operating lease contracts contain market review clauses in the event that the lessee exercises its option to renew. The lessee does not have an option to purchase the equipment at the expiry of the lease period. The Group's leases as a lessor are not material.\n\n## 26.  Contingencies\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties.\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related-party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from this or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Group has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.\n- \u00b7 On 24 March 2022, the SAT initiated an audit of the income tax computation of Comercializadora de Metales Fresnillo for the year 2016. Findings were shared by the SAT on 22 March 2023, which mainly relate to the tax treatment of the Silverstream transaction. The Company responded on 20 April 2023 and began a Conclusive Agreement procedure before the Mexican tax ombudsman (PRODECON). On 16 June 2023 and on 5 July 2023, the Company provided additional documentation and information to the SAT through PRODECON. On 31 January 2024, the PRODECON closed the Conclusive Agreement procedure as no agreement was reached between the company and the SAT. It is expected that the SAT's final conclusion on the matter will be notified to the Company no later than May 2024. The Directors believe that management's interpretation of the relevant legislation and assessment of taxation is appropriate. Also, the Directors consider that no tax liability is required to be recognised in respect of these claims or risks as the SAT's final conclusion is yet to be determined.\n- \u00b7 In 2011, flooding occurred in the Saucito mine, following which the Group filed an insurance claim in respect of the damage caused (and in respect of business interruption). This insurance claim was rejected by the insurance provider. In early 2018, after the matter had been taken to mutually agreed arbitration, the insurance claim was declared valid; however, there is disagreement about the appropriate amount to be paid. In October 2018 the Group received US$13.6 million in respect of the insurance claim, however, this does not constitute a final settlement and management continues to pursue a higher insurance payment. Due to the fact that negotiations are ongoing and there is uncertainty regarding the timing and amount involved in reaching a final settlement with the insurer, it is currently not practicable to determine the total amount expected to be recovered.\n- \u00b7 It is probable that interest income will be earned on the Group's outstanding income and value added tax receivable balances; however, there is no certainty that this interest will be realised until the underlying balance is recovered. Due to that uncertainty, it is also not practicable to estimate the amount of interest income earned but not recovered to date.\n\n## 27.  Related-party balances and transactions\n\nThe Group had the following related-party transactions during the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022 and balances as at 31 December 2023 and 2022.\n\nRelated parties are those entities owned or controlled by the ultimate controlling party, as well as those who have a minority participation in Group companies and key management personnel of the Group.",

The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option commodity contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Silverstream contract\n\nFor further information relating to the valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair value of the Silverstream contract as well as the sensitivity of the valuation to the key inputs are disclosed in note 14.\n\n## Equity investments:\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2023, approximately 89.8% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2022: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$96.9 million (2022: US$145.5 million) and 5.1% of Endeavor Silver Corp. represented by 2,800,000 (2022: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$5.5 million (2022: US$9.1 million). These equity investments are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2023 were US$10.41 (2022: US$15.62) and US$1.96 (2022: US$3.24), respectively. During the year the Group purchased 1,000,000 shares of Osisko Mining Inc., a Canadian exploration company, for a total consideration of US$2.3 million.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nThe fair value of the Group's interest-bearing loan is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Trade receivables:\n\nSales of concentrates, precipitates dor\u00e9 bars and activated carbon are 'provisionally priced' and revenue is initially recognised using this provisional price and the Group's best estimate of the contained metal. Revenue is subject to final price and metal content adjustments subsequent to the date of delivery (see note 2 (n)). This price exposure is considered to be an embedded derivative and therefore the entire related trade receivable is measured at fair value.\n\nAt each reporting date, the provisionally priced metal content is revalued based on the forward selling price for the quotational period stipulated in the relevant sales contract. The selling price of metals can be reliably measured as these metals are actively traded on international exchanges but the estimated metal content is a non-observable input to this valuation.\n\n## 31.  Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Group's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise trade and other receivables, cash, equity instruments at FVOCI, interest-bearing loans, notes payable and trade payables.\n\nThe Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, commodity price, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Group's exposure to each of the above risks and the Group's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group's risk management framework.\n\nThe Group's risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Group's activities. The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Group's risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.\n\nFinancial Statements",

Financial risk management continued\n\n## (a)  Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk that changes in market factors, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices or interest rates will affect the Group's income or the value of its financial instruments.\n\nThe objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.\n\nIn the following tables, the effect on equity excludes the changes in retained earnings as a direct result of changes in profit before tax.\n\n## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group has financial instruments that are denominated in Mexican peso and other foreign currencies which are exposed to foreign currency risk. Transactions in currencies other than the US dollar include the purchase of services, fixed assets, spare parts and the payment of dividends. As a result, the Group has financial assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nIn order to manage the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and derivatives financial instruments (excluding Silverstream which impact is disclosed in note 14) to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Group's profit before tax and equity, with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods for the purposes of calculating the sensitivity with relation to derivative financial instruments.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Strengthening/  (weakening)  of US dollar   | Effect on   profit before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   | Effect on equity:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2023                     | 10% (5%)                                    | (1,504) 871                                                            | (275) 276                                                 |\n| 2022                     | 5%                                          | 742                                                                    | 1,120                                                     |\n|                          | (5%)                                        | (820)                                                                  | 3,610                                                     |\n\nThe Group's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.\n\n## Commodity risk\n\nThe Group has exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically silver, gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant effect on the Group's results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.\n\nThe Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against an element of gold, zinc and lead price.\n\nThe table below reflects the aggregate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities (excluding Silverstream which impact is disclosed in note 14) to a reasonably possible change in commodities prices, reflecting the impact on the Group's profit before tax with all other variables held constant.\n\nThe sensitivity shown in the table below relates to changes in fair value of commodity derivatives financial instruments contracts (excluding Silverstream) and embedded derivatives in sales.\n\n|                        | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   | Increase/(decrease) in commodity prices   |                                                                      |                                                         |\n|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|\n| Year ended 31 December | Gold                                      | Silver                                    | Zinc                                      | Lead                                      | Effect on   profit before tax:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands | Effect on equity:  increase/  (decrease)  US$ thousands |\n| 2023                   | 10%                                       | 10%                                       | 10%                                       | 10%                                       | 26,375                                                               | -                                                       |\n|                        | (10%)                                     | (10%)                                     | (10%)                                     | (10%)                                     | (26,375)                                                             | -                                                       |\n| 2022                   | 10% (10%)                                 | 20% (15%)                                 | 20% (15%)                                 | 15% (15%)                                 | 31,529 (27,660)                                                      | - -                                                     |\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments, principally relating to the cash balances and the Silverstream contract held at the balance sheet date as explained in note 14.

Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Group's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counterparty. The Group's financial assets are with counterparties with what the Group considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 27, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Group's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due, other than 'Other receivables' as disclosed in note 16. The Group's policies are aimed at minimising losses from foreign currency hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency hedging contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Group has a high concentration of trade receivables with one counterparty Met-Mex Pe\u00f1oles, the Group's sole customer throughout 2023 and 2022. A further concentration of credit risk arises from the Silverstream contract. Both Met-Mex and the counterparty to the Silverstream contract are subsidiaries in the Pe\u00f1oles group which currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and is considered by management to be of appropriate credit rating.\n\nThe Group's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments investing in several financial institutions. Accordingly, on an ongoing basis the Group deposits surplus funds with a range of financial institutions, depending on market conditions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Group only deposits surplus funds with financial institutions with a credit rating of MX-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor's) and above. As at 31 December 2023, the Group had concentrations of credit risk as 35 percent of surplus funds were deposited with one financial institution of which the total investment was held in short-term deposits.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 17 for the maximum credit exposure to cash and cash equivalents note 16 for other receivables and note 27 for related-party trade and other receivables. The maximum credit exposure with relation to the Silverstream contract is the value of the derivative as at 31 December 2023, being US$482.3 million (2022: US$511.5 million).",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interest-bearing loans, excluding net unrealised gains or losses on revaluation of derivatives financial instruments and Equity instruments at FVOCI. Refer to notes 18, 20 and 30 respectively for a quantitative summary of these items.\n\nIn order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Group management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Group's dividend policy is based on the profitability of the business and underlying growth in earnings of the Group, as well as its capital requirements and cash flows, including cash flows from the Silverstream.\n\nOne of the Group's metrics of capital is cash and other liquid assets which in 2023 and 2022 consisted of only cash and cash equivalents, which details are disclosed in note 17.\n\n## 32.  Subsequent events\n\nDuring January 2024 the Company entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility (the 'facility') with a term from January 2024 to January 2029. The maximum amount available under the facility is US$350.0 million. The facility is unsecured and has an interest rate on drawn amounts of SOFR plus an interest margin of 1.15%. The terms of this facility include financial covenants related to leverage and interest cover ratios. No amounts have been drawn from the facility to date.",

Corporate information\n\nFresnillo plc (the 'Company') is a public limited company and registered in England and Wales with registered number 6344120 and is the holding company for the Fresnillo subsidiaries detailed in note 5. The Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes with tax residency in Mexico City. For further information see note 4.\n\nIndustrias Pe\u00f1oles S.A.B. de C.V. ('Pe\u00f1oles') currently owns 75 percent of the shares of the Company and the ultimate controlling party of the Company is the Baill\u00e8res family, whose beneficial interest is held through Pe\u00f1oles. The country of incorporation of Pe\u00f1oles is Mexico. Copies of Pe\u00f1oles' accounts can be obtained from www.penoles.com.mx.\n\nThe primary activity of the Company is as a holding company for the Fresnillo Group of companies (see note 5).\n\nThe financial statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of Fresnillo plc on 4 March 2024.\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies\n\n## (a)  Basis of preparation and statement of compliance\n\nThe Company's separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards and the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\n\nThe financial statements of the Company have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for certain derivative financial instruments and equity securities which have been measured at fair value.\n\nThe financial statements are presented in dollars of the United States of America (US dollars or US$) and all monetary amounts are rounded to the nearest thousand (US$000) except when otherwise indicated.\n\nThe basis of preparation and accounting policies used in preparing the financial statements are set out below. These accounting policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Going concern\n\nThe financial position of the Company and its cash flows are set out in the balance sheet and statement of cashflows respectively. In addition, note 16 includes: the Company's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nIn making their assessment of the Company's ability to manage its future cash requirements, the Directors have considered the Company budgets and the cash flow forecasts for the period to 31 December 2025 (being the going concern assessment period). The Directors have also considered the cash position as of 31 December 2023 (US$215.9 million) and the net current asset position (US$1,575.5 million).\n\nAfter reviewing all of the above considerations, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that management have sufficient flexibility in adverse circumstances to maintain adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors, therefore, continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.\n\n## (b)  Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the separate financial statements are consistent with those applied in the preparation of the separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.\n\n## New standards, interpretations and amendments (new standards) adopted by the Company\n\nA number of new or amended standards became applicable for the current reporting period. The Company did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these standards.\n\nThe Company has evaluated the applicability of Pillar II rules considering that the Company is tax resident in Mexico, management also assessed the status of the Pillar II legislation in the country, however, no laws or regulations have been enacted to the date of this report.\n\n## Standards, interpretations and amendments issued but not yet effective\n\nThe IASB has issued other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs that management considers do not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Company. The Company has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that was issued but is not yet effective.\n\n## (c)  Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Company's financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements. These judgements and estimates are based on management's knowledge of the relevant facts and circumstances, with regard to prior experience, but actual results may differ from the amounts included in the financial statements. Information about such judgements and estimates is in the accounting policies and the notes to the financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 2.  Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Judgements\n\nAreas of judgement, apart from those involving estimations, that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the separate financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 are:\n\n## Deferred tax asset (note 4):\n\nThe Company has recognised a deferred tax asset of US$68.9 million (2022: US$61.7 million) mainly in respect of tax losses amounting to US$239.0 million (2022: US$277.7 million). In accordance with there are no tax losses expiring in a period of four years (2022: US$26.5 million) and US$239.0 million (2022: US$251.2 million) will expire in a period between eight and ten years. The Company has performed an assessment of the recoverability of tax losses before their expiration based on financial and tax projections. Despite an accounting loss in the current and prior periods, management have considered the taxable profit generated in the current year of US$91.3 million and based on a consideration of this, combined with future projections of taxable profit, consider that there is evidence that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised.\n\n## Climate change:\n\nWe describe how climate-related risks and opportunities (CROs) may affect and was considered in the preparation of the financial statements in note 2 (c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Because the cash flows underpinning the recoverable amount of mining assets also underpin the recoverable amount of investments in subsidiaries holding those mining assets, the considerations set out in that note also apply to the Parent Company financial statements. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities for which measurement is directly linked to climate change performance (for example: Sustainability-Linked Bonds).\n\nAs disclosed in note 2 (c) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, future changes to the Group's climate change strategy, global decarbonisation signposts and regulation may impact the Group's significant judgements and key estimates and result in material changes to financial results and the carrying values of certain of the Group's assets and liabilities in future reporting periods, which could ultimately result in material changes in the carrying value of the Company's assets and liabilities. However, as at the balance sheet date, management believes there is no material impact on the Company's balance sheet carrying values of assets or liabilities.\n\n## Estimates and assumptions\n\nThe significant area of estimation uncertainty made by management in preparing the financial statements is:\n\n- \u00b7 Recoverable value of investments in subsidiaries (notes 2 (e) and 5):\n\nThe Company assesses investments in subsidiaries annually to determine whether any indication of impairment exists. Where an indicator of impairment exists, a formal estimate of the recoverable amount is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCD) and the value in use. Due to the nature of the subsidiaries, the assessment of the recoverable amount is generally determined based on the net present value of future cash flows related to the subsidiaries requiring the use of estimates and assumptions such as long-term commodity prices, estimated and economically-proven and probable reserves, as well as certain other resources that are assessed as highly likely to be converted into reserves and the associated production profiles, discount rates, future capital requirements and productions costs. Estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The determination of that rate requires certain judgements.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, the Company assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of that investment, requiring similar estimates and assumptions as those for determining an impairment charge. At 31 December 2023 the Company recognised an impairment charge of US$730.8 million (2022: net impairment charge of US$1,755.0 million) resulting in a cumulative impairment relating to subsidiaries of US$4,471.5 million (2022: US$3,740.7 million).\n\n## (d)  Foreign currency translation\n\nThe Company's financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the functional currency of the Company. The functional currency for the Company is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.\n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences that arise are recorded in the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated into US dollars using the exchange rate at the date when the fair valued is determined.",

        "page_content": "Financial Statements\n\n## (e)  Investments in subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are entities which the Company controls due to it being exposed to, or having the right to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment. Impairment charges and reversals, up to the value of the merger reserve, are reclassified from retained earnings to the merger reserve.\n\nWhen the Company increases its capital investment in or where there is a return of share capital from its subsidiaries, such movements are recognised as an addition to, or return of the original cost recognised in investment in subsidiaries. Dividends are recognised as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established.\n\nAt each reporting date, an assessment is made to determine whether there are any indicators of impairment. Where an indicator of impairment exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount of the investment in subsidiary is made, which is considered to be the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal and the value in use. The Company usually determines FVLCD based on the net present value of the future cash flows related to its subsidiaries. If the carrying amount of an investment exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded in the income statement to reflect the investment at the recoverable amount.\n\nWhere an impairment charge has previously been recognised, an assessment is made at the end of each reporting period whether there is any indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist or may have decreased. If any such indication exists, an estimate of the recoverable amount is made. An impairment loss is reversed to profit or loss to the extent that the increased carrying value of the investment in subsidiary does not exceed that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.\n\n## (f)  Financial assets and liabilities\n\n## Financial assets\n\nThe Company classifies its financial assets in the following measurement categories:\n\n- \u00b7 those to be measured at amortised cost;\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at FVOCI; and\n- \u00b7 those to be measured subsequently at FVPL.\n\nThe classification depends on the Company's business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual terms of the cash flows.\n\nFor assets measured at fair value, gains and losses will either be recorded in profit or loss or OCI. For investments in equity instruments that are not held for trading, this will depend on whether the Company has made an irrevocable election at the time of initial recognition to account for the equity investment at FVOCI.\n\nSubsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company's business model for managing the asset and the cash flow characteristics of the asset.\n\n## Classification\n\nThe Company holds the following financial assets:\n\n## Amortised cost\n\nAssets that are held for collection of contractual cash flows where those cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Interest income from these financial assets is included in finance income using the effective interest rate method. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition is recognised directly in profit or loss and presented in other gains/(losses) together with foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nThe Company's financial assets at amortised cost include receivables from loans granted to subsidiaries.\n\n## Equity instruments designated as fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nUpon initial recognition, the Company can elect to classify irrevocably its equity investments as equity instruments designated at FVOCI when they meet the definition of equity under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and are not held for trading. The classification is determined on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nGains and losses on these financial assets are never recycled to profit or loss. Dividends are recognised as other income in the income statement when the right of payment has been established, except when the Company benefits from such proceeds as a recovery of part of the cost of the financial asset, in which case, such gains are recorded in OCI. Equity instruments designated at FVOCI are not subject to impairment assessment.\n\nThe Company elected to classify irrevocably its listed equity investments under this category.",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## Fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at FVPL. A gain or loss on a debt investment that is subsequently measured at FVPL is recognised in profit or loss and presented net within other gains/(losses) in the period in which it arises.\n\nChanges in the fair value of financial assets at FVPL are recognised in other gains/(losses) in the income statement as applicable.\n\nThe Company's derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## De-recognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Impairment of financial assets\n\nFor loans granted to subsidiaries the Company evaluate the expecting credit loss using a one-year probability of default corresponding to the mining industry determined by a specialised financial institution and considering an appropriate severity based on the cost of capital of the Company.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classified, at initial recognition, as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and borrowings, payables or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate.\n\nAll financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs.\n\nThe Company's financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Classification\n\nFor purposes of subsequent measurement, financial liabilities held by the Company are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost.\n\nAfter initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process.\n\nAmortised cost is calculated by considering any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the income statement.\n\n## De-recognition of financial liabilities\n\nA financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.\n\n## (g)  Cash and cash equivalents\n\nFor the purposes of the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank, cash on hand and short-term deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. Short-term deposits earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates between one day and three months.\n\n## (h)  Share capital\n\nOrdinary Shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue. The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.\n\n## (i)  Dividends receivable\n\nDividends are recognised when the Company's right to receive payments is established. Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.",

The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\n\n## Deferred income tax\n\nDeferred income tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.\n\nDeferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\nDeferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:\n\n- \u00b7 where the deferred income tax asset relating to deductible temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and\n- \u00b7 in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.\n\nThe carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.\n\nUnrecognised deferred income tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the income statement.\n\nDeferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities are offset, if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred income taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority.\n\n## (k)  Derivative financial instruments and hedging\n\nThe Company enters into derivative contracts in order to manage certain market risks derived from changes in foreign exchange and commodity prices which impact the financial and business transactions of its subsidiaries. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.\n\nIn the Group's consolidated financial statements certain of these derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges but for the purposes of the Company's stand-alone financial statements the related hedged items are not held by the Company, so do not qualify as cash flow hedges.\n\nAny gains and losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the income statement.\n\nDerivatives are valued using valuation approaches and methodologies (such as Black Scholes and Net Present Value) applicable to the specific type of derivative instrument. The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.\n\nFinancial Statements",

Significant accounting policies continued\n\n## (l)  Fair value measurement\n\nThe Company measures financial instruments at fair value at each balance sheet date. Fair values of financial instruments measured at amortised cost are disclosed in notes 15.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:\n\n- \u00b7 in the principal market for the asset or liability; or\n- \u00b7 in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability.\n\nThe principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible to the Company.\n\nThe fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest.\n\nA fair value measurement of a non-financial asset considers a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use.\n\nThe Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs.\n\nAll assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole:\n\nLevel 1 - Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable.\n\nLevel 3 - Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable.\n\nFor assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation (based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.\n\nFor the purpose of fair value disclosures, the Company has determined classes of assets and liabilities based on the nature, characteristics and risks of the asset or liability and the level of the fair value hierarchy as explained above. Further information on fair values is described in note 15.\n\n## (m)  Dividend distribution\n\nDividends on the Company's Ordinary Shares are recognised when they have been appropriately authorised and are no longer at the Company's discretion. Accordingly, interim dividends are recognised when they are paid and final dividends are recognised when they are declared following approval by shareholders at the Company's Annual General Meeting.\n\nMexican Income Tax Law establishes a 10% withholding on earnings from 2014 and thereafter, for dividends paid to foreign residents and Mexican individuals.\n\nDividends paid are not subject to income tax if paid from the Net Tax Profit Account (CUFIN). Dividends paid that exceed CUFIN are subject to an income tax payable at a rate of 30%. The tax is payable by the Company and may be credited against the normal income tax payable by the Company in the year in which the dividends are paid or in the following two years. Dividends paid from earnings previously taxed are not subject to any withholding or additional tax payment.\n\n## 3.  Segment reporting\n\nSegmental information is not presented in the Company's stand-alone financial statements as this is presented in the Group's consolidated financial statements.",

The temporary differences for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised aggregate to US$1,015 million (2022: US$1,006 million).\n\n## (c)  Corporate Income Tax ('Impuesto Sobre la Renta' or 'ISR')\n\nThe Company is a Mexican resident for taxation purposes. The rate of current corporate income tax is 30%.\n\n## 5.

As a result, a cumulative impairment loss of US$4,471.5 million is recognised with respect to certain of the Company's investment in subsidiaries (2022: US$3,740.7 million). The recoverable amount was estimated based on the Fair Value Less Cost of Disposal (FVLCD) model (2022: FVLCD).\n\nFinancial Statements",

Accordingly, the fair value is categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The price assumptions used to calculate FVLCD are determined with reference analysts' consensus of long-term prices. As at 31 December 2023, the Company used long-term price assumptions of US$1,714/ounce (2022: US$1,838/ounce) and US$22.5/ounce (2022: US$24.1/ounce) for gold and silver, respectively.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nAs at 31 December 2023 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may be affected by a reasonably possible change in silver and gold prices. Management has considered a decrease in gold and silver of 10% and 10% respectively (2022: 10% gold, 15% silver). The sensitivity resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$251.4 million (2022: US$465.0 million), Minera Mexicana la Ci\u00e9nega, S.A. de C.V. US$54.1 million (2022: US$91.4 million), Minera Saucito, S.A. de C.V. US$161.9 million (2022: US$133.0 million), Minera San Juli\u00e1n, S.A. de C.V. US$86.5 million (2022: 131.7 million) and Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. US$190.4 million (2022: US$189.2 million).\n\nAdditionally, as at 31 December 2023 management has performed a sensitivity analysis for those subsidiaries where cumulative impairment may be affected by a reasonably possible change in future production and operating costs considering in isolation each input. Management has considered a decrease in future production of 10% (2022: 10%) and an increase in operating costs of 10% (2022: 8%). These sensitivities resulted in an additional impairment on Minera Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V. of US$122.1 million (2022: US$262.0 million) and US$149.9 million (2022: US$132.9 million) respectively, Minera San Juli\u00e1n, S.A. de C.V. of US$41.9 million (2022: US$nil) and US$36.6 million (2022: US$nil) respectively and Minera Penmont, S. de R.L. de C.V. US$94.3 million (2022: US$188.4 million) and US$119.7 million (2022: US$82.8 million) respectively.\n\nOther than as disclosed above, management has considered that the fair value of the investments in subsidiaries are not significantly sensitive to reasonably possible change in any other key assumptions.",

The proceeds were partially used to finance the repurchase mentioned above.\n\nOn 13 November 2023, the Company paid the outstanding amount of the 5.500% Notes at its maturity date including due interest for a total of US$326.6 million.\n\nMovements in the year in the debt recognised in the balance sheet are as follows:\n\n|                                                | As at 31 December   | As at 31 December   |\n|------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                | 2023  US$ thousands | 2022  US$ thousands |\n| Opening balance                                | 1,158,557           | 1,157,545           |\n| Accrued interest 1                             | 53,919              | 56,475              |\n| Payments of 5.500% Notes                       | (317,879)           | -                   |\n| Interest paid                                  | (56,371)            | (56,371)            |\n| Amortisation of discount and transaction costs | 776                 | 908                 |\n| Closing balance                                | 839,002             | 1,158,557           |\n| Less - Current portion                         | -                   | 317,879             |\n| Non-current portion                            | 839,002             | 840,678             |\n\nThe Company has the following restrictions derived from the issuance of all outstanding Senior Notes:\n\n## Change of control:\n\nShould the rating of the Senior Notes be downgraded as a result of a change of control (defined as the sale or transfer of 35% or more of the common shares; the transfer of all or substantially all the assets of the Group; starting a dissolution or liquidation process; or the loss of the majority in the Board of Directors) the Company is obligated to repurchase the notes at an equivalent price of 101% of their nominal value plus the interest earned at the repurchase date, if requested to do so by any creditor.\n\n## Pledge on assets:\n\nThe Company shall not pledge or allow a pledge on any property that may have a material impact on business performance (key assets). Nevertheless, the Company may pledge the aforementioned properties provided that the repayment of the Notes keeps the same level of priority as the pledge on those assets.\n\n## 11.  Contingencies\n\nThe Company is subject to various laws and regulations which, if not observed, could give rise to penalties. As of 31 December 2023, the Company has the following contingencies:\n\n- \u00b7 Tax periods remain open to review by the Mexican tax authorities (SAT, by its Spanish acronym) in respect of income taxes for five years following the date of the filing of corporate income tax returns, during which time the authorities have the right to raise additional tax assessments including penalties and interest. Under certain circumstances, the reviews may cover longer periods. As such, there is a risk that transactions, and in particular related-party transactions, that have not been challenged in the past by the authorities, may be challenged by them in the future.\n- \u00b7 It is not practical to determine the amount of any potential claims or the likelihood of any unfavourable outcome arising from these or any future inspections that may be initiated. However, management believes that its interpretation of the relevant legislation is appropriate and that the Company has complied with all regulations and paid or accrued all taxes and withholdings that are applicable.\n- \u00b7 On 8 May 2008, the Company and Pe\u00f1oles entered into the Separation Agreement (the 'Separation Agreement'). This agreement relates to the separation of the Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group and governs certain aspects of the relationship between the Fresnillo Group and the Pe\u00f1oles Group following the initial public offering in May 2008 ('Admission'). The Separation Agreement provides for cross-indemnities between the Company and Pe\u00f1oles so that, in the case of Pe\u00f1oles, it is held harmless against losses, claims and liabilities (including tax liabilities) properly attributable to the precious metals business of the Group and, in the case of the Company, it is held harmless by Pe\u00f1oles against losses, claims and liabilities which are not properly attributable to the precious metals business. Save for any liability arising in connection with tax, the aggregate liability of either party under the indemnities shall not exceed US$250 million in aggregate.",

        "page_content": "## NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED\n\n## 15.  Financial instruments continued\n\nThe following valuation techniques were used to estimate the fair values:\n\n## Option and forward foreign exchange contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The foreign currency forward (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot exchange rates, the yield curves of the respective currencies as well as the currency basis spreads between the respective currencies. The foreign currency option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot exchange rates, interest rates and the volatility of the currency.\n\n## Option commodity contracts\n\nThe Company enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The option commodity (Level 2) contracts are measured based on observable spot commodity prices, the yield curves of the respective commodity as well as the commodity basis spreads between the respective commodities. The option contracts are valued using the Black Scholes model, the significant inputs to which include observable spot commodities price, interest rates and the volatility of the commodity.\n\n## Equity investments\n\nThe fair value of equity investments is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1). These investments were irrevocably designated at fair value through OCI as the Group considers these investments to be strategic in nature. As of 31 December 2023, approximately 89.8% of the investments correspond to 9,314,877 shares (2022: 9,314,877 shares) of Mag Silver, Corp. for an amount of US$96.9 million (2022: US$145.5 million) and 5.1% of Endeavor Silver Corp. represented by 2,800,000 (2022: 2,800,000 shares) shares for an amount of US$5.5 million (2022: US$9.1 million). These equity investments are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The prices per share as 31 December 2023 were US$10.41 (2022: US$15.62) and US$1.96 (2022: US$3.24), respectively. During the year the Company purchased 1,000,000 shares of Osisko Mining Inc., a Canadian exploration company, for a total consideration of US$2.3 million.\n\n## Interest-bearing loans\n\nFair value of the Company's interest-bearing loan, is derived from quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1).\n\n## Loans with related parties\n\nFair value of the Company's loan to related parties is determined using a discounted cash flow method based on market interest rates at each reporting date.\n\n## 16.  Financial risk management\n\n## Overview\n\nThe Company's principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, are comprised of equity investment at FVOCI, cash, loans to related parties, interest-bearing loans and trade payables.\n\nThe Company enters into certain derivative transactions with the purpose of managing foreign exchange risk arising on the activity and transactions of its subsidiaries.\n\nThe Company has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments:\n\n- \u00b7 Market risk, including foreign currency, interest rate and equity price risks.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk.\n\nThis note presents information about the Company's exposure to each of the above risks and the Company's objectives, policies and processes for assessing and managing risk. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout the financial statements.\n\nThe Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Company risk management framework.\n\nThe Company's risk management policies have been established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Company activities. The Company, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.\n\nThe Fresnillo Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing how management monitors compliance with the Company risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Company. The Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, which undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.",

Transactions in foreign currencies include the purchase of services, payment or receipt of dividends and other items. As a result, the Company has financial liabilities denominated in currencies other than functional currency and holds cash and cash equivalents in Mexican peso.\n\nIn order to manage the Group's exposure to foreign currency risk on expenditure denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, the Group has entered into certain forward and option derivative contracts.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate compared to the Mexican peso, reflecting the impact on the Company's profit before tax with all other variables held constant. It is assumed that the same percentage change in exchange rates is applied to all applicable periods. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Strengthening/  (weakening) of  US dollar   | Effect on  profit before  tax: increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2023                     | 10%                                         | 426                                                                  |\n|                          | (5%)                                        | (735)                                                                |\n| 2022                     | 5%                                          | 1,294                                                                |\n|                          | (5%)                                        | (1,171)                                                              |\n\nThe Company's exposure to reasonably possible changes in other currencies is not material.\n\n## Commodity risk\n\nThe Company's subsidiaries have exposure to changes in metals prices (specifically gold, lead and zinc) which have a significant effect on the Group's results. These prices are subject to global economic conditions and industry-related cycles.\n\nThe Company uses derivative instruments to hedge against precious metals commodity price exposure in its subsidiaries. As the Company passes through the effect of derivatives to its subsidiaries, the Company is not sensitive to changes in commodity prices.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Company is exposed to interest rate risk from the possibility that changes in interest rates will affect future cash flows or the fair values of its financial instruments. The Company's earnings are sensitive to changes in interest rates on any floating element of the loans with related parties and interest earned on cash balances. Interest-bearing loans are at a fixed rate, therefore the possibility of a change in interest rate only impacts its fair value but not its carrying amount. Therefore, interest-bearing loans and loans from related parties (for which exposure is not material) are excluded from the table below.\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity of all financial assets and financial liabilities to a reasonably possible change in interest rate applied to a full year from the balance sheet date. There is no impact on the Company's equity other than the equivalent change in retained earnings.\n\n| Year ended 31 December   | Basis point  increase/ (decrease)  in interest rate   | Effect on  profit before  tax: increase/ (decrease)  US$ thousands   |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 2023 1                   | -                                                     | -                                                                    |\n|                          | (75)                                                  | (11,810)                                                             |\n| 2022                     | 100                                                   | 15,108                                                               |\n|                          | (25)                                                  | (3,777)                                                              |",

Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject to credit limits to ensure that the Company's exposure to bad debts is not significant. The Company's exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each counter party. The Company's financial assets are with counterparties that the Company considers to have an appropriate credit rating. As disclosed in note 12, the counterparties to a significant proportion of these financial assets are related parties. At each balance sheet date, the Company's financial assets were neither credit-impaired nor past due other than 'Related party accounts receivables' as is disclosed in note 12. The Company's policies are aimed at minimising losses from the foreign currency and commodity hedging contracts. The Company's foreign currency and commodity derivative contracts are entered into with large financial institutions with strong credit ratings.\n\nThe Company's surplus funds are managed by Servicios Administrativos Fresnillo, S.A. de C.V., which manages cash and cash equivalents investing in several financial institutions. In order to minimise exposure to credit risk, the Company only deposits cash and cash equivalents with financial institutions with a credit rating of M-1 (Moody's) and mxA-1+ (Standard and Poor's) and above, and only for periods of less than three months.\n\nThe maximum credit exposure at the reporting date of each category of financial asset above is the carrying value as detailed in the relevant notes. See note 15 (a) for the maximum credit exposure for other financial assets, note 7 for cash and cash equivalents and note 12 for related-party balances.\n\n## (c) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company monitors its risk of a shortage of funds using projected cash flows and by monitoring the maturity of both its financial assets and liabilities.\n\nThe table below summarises the maturity profile of the Company financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n|                          | US$ thousands   |           |           |           |           |\n|--------------------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n|                          | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years | 4-5 years | > 5 years | Total     |\n| As at 31 December 2023   |                 |           |           |           |           |\n| Interest-bearing loans   | 37,986          | 75,973    | 75,973    | 1,685,699 | 1,875,631 |\n| Trade and other payables | 4,171           | -         | -         | -         | 4,171     |\n\n|                                                 | Within 1 year   | 2-3 years   | 4-5 years   | > 5 years   | US$ thousands Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-----------------------|\n| As at 31 December 2022                          |                 |             |             |             |                       |\n| Interest-bearing loans                          | 374,249         | 75,973      | 75,973      | 1,723,686   | 2,249,881             |\n| Derivatives financial instruments - liabilities | 487             | -           | -           | -           | 487                   |\n| Trade and other payables                        | 1,249           | -           | -           | -           | 1,249                 |",

Management considers capital to consist of equity and interestbearing loans (note 10), as disclosed in the balance sheet and equity investments at FVOCI (note 15).\n\nIn order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholder's capital invested in the Company, management thoroughly evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions and approves them at its Executive Committee before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable. The Company's dividend policy aims to pay out 33-50% of profit after tax each year, while making certain adjustments to exclude non-cash effects in the income statement. Dividends are paid in the approximate ratio of one-third as an interim dividend and two-thirds as a final dividend. Before declaring a dividend, the Board carries out a detailed analysis of the profitability of the business, underlying earnings, capital requirements and cash flow. The Company aim is to maintain enough flexibility to be able to react to movements in precious metals prices and seize attractive business opportunities.\n\n## 17.  Subsequent events\n\nDuring January 2024 the Company entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility (the 'facility') with a term from January 2024 to January 2029. The maximum amount available under the facility is US$350.0 million. The facility is unsecured and has an interest rate on drawn amounts of SOFR plus an interest margin of 1.15%. The terms of this facility include financial covenants related to leverage and interest cover ratios. No amounts have been drawn from the facility to date.",

Mineral resources are not ore reserves and do not have demonstrated economic viability. All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Gold, silver, lead and zinc assays were capped where appropriate.\n- 2 Mineral resources are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). The AgEq variable cut-offs grades are calculated by dividing the applicable costs by a variable Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries and payabilities.\n- 3 The cut-off grade for Ci\u00e9nega's mineral resources varies between 289 and 330 g/t AgEq.\n- \u00b7 All mineral resources were estimated by Fresnillo. William Cain, B.Sc, AIPG CPG 12063 of SRK, a Competent Person reviewed and audited the resource estimates for Ci\u00e9nega. Benjamin Parsons, BSc, MSc Geology, MAusIMM (CP) #222568 of SRK, a Competent Person, reviewed and audited the resource estimates for Fresnillo and Saucito. Scott Burkett, SME-RM #04229765 of SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc., a Competent Person, reviewed and audited the resource estimates for San Juli\u00e1n.\n- * Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,450.00), Silver (US$/oz 20.00), Lead (US$/lb 0.90) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.15).",

All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates.\n- 3 Herradura open pit mineral resources are reported at various cut-offs dependent on material types and grade. Oxide material above 0.23 g/t Au and below 1.00 g/t Au reports to the heap leach; transitional and sulfide material above 0.24 g/t and below 0.51 g/t Au reports to the heap leach; oxide material above 1.00 g/t Au reports to the mill; transitional and sulphide material above 0.51 g/t Au reports to the mill.\n- 4 The Soledad-Dipolos mine has been subject to legal actions regarding surface access; it is assumed these actions will eventually be settled favourably and mining operations resumed.\n- 5 Centauro Profundo underground mineral resources estimated using an assumed underground mining scenario beyond the current Herradura mineral resources open pit, with appropriate cut-off grade considered at US$1,450/oz Au price, 93% metallurgical recovery.\n- \u00b7 The mineral resources were estimated by Fresnillo.

All figures rounded to reflect the relative accuracy of the estimates. Composites were capped where appropriate. Mineral resources are reported at variable metal, metal equivalent or NSR cut-off grades, assuming reasonable metal recoveries. Orisyvo, Lucerito, Candame\u00f1a and Rodeo mineral resources are reported inside a conceptual pit shell based on appropriate mining and processing costs and metal recoveries for oxide and sulphide material. Equivalent metal grades are based on US$1,450 per ounce of gold, US$20.00 per ounce of silver, US$1.20 per pound of zinc, US$0.90 per pound of lead and US$3.00 per pound of copper.\n- * Cut-off grade calculations assume variable metallurgical recoveries.\n- ** Mineral resources statement prepared independently by SRK CA.",

Mineral reserves are reported at metal equivalent cut-off grades based on metal price assumptions*, variable metallurgical recovery assumptions (variable metallurgical recoveries as a function of grade and relative metal distribution), mining costs, processing costs, general and administrative (G&A) costs, sustaining capital costs and variable NSR factors (NSR factors include smelting and transportation costs). Each AgEq cut-off is calculated by dividing the appropriate cost by the corresponding Ag net value factor which includes prices, recoveries and payabilities.\n- 2 Reserves include planned dilution to a minimum mining width and to minable outlines. Additionally, based on mining method, floor dilution is included, and appropriate mining recovery factors are applied.\n- 3 The cut-off grades for the Ci\u00e9nega reserve vary between 303 and 388 g/t AgEq.\n- * Metal price assumptions considered for the calculation of metal equivalent grades are: Gold (US$/oz 1,450.00), Silver (US$/oz 20.00), Lead (US$/lb 0.90) and Zinc (US$/lb 1.15). \u00b7 The reserves are valid as of 31 May, 2023. All topography is valid as of 31 May, 2023.\n- \u00b7 All ore reserves were estimated by Fresnillo.

These calls come from fraudsters operating in 'boiler rooms', mostly based abroad. While high profits are promised, those who buy or sell shares in this way usually lose their money. Most victims are experienced investors, losing on average \u00a320,000.\n\n## Protect yourself\n\nIf you are offered unsolicited investment advice, discounted shares, inflated prices for shares you own, or free company or research reports, take these steps before handing over any money:\n\n- 1. Get the name of the person and organisation.\n- 2.  Check the Financial Services Register at www.fca.org.uk/ register to ensure they are authorised.\n- 3.  Use the details on the Financial Services Register to contact the firm.\n- 4.  Call the FCA Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768 if there are no contact details on the Register or you are told they are out of date.\n- 5.  Search the list of unauthorised firms and individuals to avoid doing business with.\n- 6. REMEMBER: if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is!\n\nIf you use an unauthorised firm to buy or sell shares, you will not have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service or Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) if things go wrong.\n\n## Report a scam\n\nIf you are approached about a share scam you should tell the FCA using the form at www.fca.org.uk/scams (where you can also review the latest scams) or call the Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.\n\n## If you have already paid money to share fraudsters then contact Action Fraud on 0300 123 2040.\n\n## For further information, please visit our website:\n\nwww.fresnilloplc.com or contact:\n\nFresnillo plc\n\nTel: +44(0)20 7399 2470\n\nGabriela Mayor, Head of Investor Relations\n\n5 March 2024\n\n24 April 2024\n\n21 May 2024\n\n24 July 2024\n\n30 July 2024\n\n23 October 2024",
