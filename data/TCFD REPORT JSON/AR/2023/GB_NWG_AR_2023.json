        "page_content": "## NatWest Group plc\n\n## 2023 NatWest Group performance summary\n\n## Chief Executive, Paul Thwaite, commented:\n\n'We have delivered a strong performance in an exceptional macro environment. Our operating profit was up 20% on the year before, with a return on tangible equity of 17.8% and \u00a33.6 billion of distributions to shareholders.\n\nThe strength of our balance sheet allows us to support our customers and our performance is grounded in the services we have provided to help them reach their financial goals and manage their money better.\n\nAs we look ahead, I am ambitious and confident for the future of NatWest Group. We should not underestimate the strength of our foundations or the opportunity to build deeper relationships with our 19 million customers. Our number one priority is to serve our customers well and provide them with the products, services, and expertise they need.\n\nThis year we are focussed on the things we can control; delivering profitable growth, becoming more efficient, more productive, and simpler to deal with, whilst managing our cost and capital efficiently. Together, these actions will drive long-term, sustainable value for our customers, shareholders, and the wider UK economy.'\n\n## Strong financial performance and delivery against our targets\n\n- \uf02d Full year attributable profit of \u00a34.4 billion and a return on tangible equity (RoTE) of 17.8%, above our guided range.\n- \uf02d Bank net interest margin (NIM) of 3.04% was 19 basis points higher than 2022 with the increase reflecting favourable yield curve movements partially offset by lending margin pressure, reduced deposits balances and mix changes.\n- \uf02d Total income excluding notable items (1) of \u00a314.3 billion increased by \u00a31.3 billion, or 9.8%, compared with 2022 principally reflecting the impact of favourable yield curve movements, higher income in our markets business and lending growth partially offset by reduced deposit balances and mix changes and lending margin pressure.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses of \u00a37.6 billion increased by \u00a3339 million, or 4.6%, compared with 2022. The cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) was 51.8% for 2023 compared with 55.5% for 2022.\n- \uf02d A net impairment charge of \u00a3578 million for 2023, or 15 basis points of gross customer loans, principally reflects continued low and stable levels of stage 3 defaults across the portfolio and good book charges related to unsecured lending.\n\n## Robust balance sheet with strong capital and liquidity levels\n\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers excluding central items increased by \u00a38.9 billion, or 2.6%, to \u00a3355.6 billion during 2023 reflecting a \u00a37.6 billion increase in Retail Banking and \u00a32.0 billion in Commercial & Institutional as term loan facilities and private financing increased. Retail Banking gross new mortgage lending was \u00a329.8 billion for the year compared with \u00a341.4 billion in 2022 reflecting the smaller mortgage market.\n- \uf02d Up to 31 December 2023 we have provided \u00a361.9 billion against our target to provide \u00a3100 billion climate and sustainable funding and financing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits excluding central items reduced \u00a313.8 billion, or 3.2%, during 2023 to \u00a3419.1 billion principally reflecting the competitive environment for deposits and an overall market liquidity contraction. Term balances now account for 16% of our book, up from 15% at the end of the third quarter and 6% at Q4 2022.\n- \uf02d The loan:deposit ratio (LDR) (excl. repos and reverse repos) was 84% with customer deposits exceeding net loans to customers by around \u00a366 billion.\n- \uf02d The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) of 144%, representing \u00a345.4 billion headroom above 100% minimum requirement, decreased by 1 percentage point compared with 2022.\n- \uf02d TNAV per share increased by 28 pence in the year to 292 pence primarily reflecting the attributable profit for the period and movements in cash flow hedging reserves as rate expectations lowered.\n\n## Shareholder return supported strong capital generation\n\n- \uf02d A final dividend of 11.5 pence per share is proposed and we intend to commence an on-market buyback programme of up to \u00a3300 million in 2024, taking total distributions deducted from capital in the year to \u00a33.6 billion, or around 40 pence per share.\n- \uf02d Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 13.4% was 80 basis points lower than 31 December 2022 principally reflecting distributions of c.200 basis points and increased RWAs of c.50 basis points partially offset by the attributable profit, c.220 basis points.\n- \uf02d RWAs of \u00a3183.0 billion increased \u00a36.9 billion during the year primarily due to lending growth in Commercial & Institutional and a \u00a33.0 billion increase due to CRD IV model updates partially offset by a \u00a34.0 billion reduction as we continue our exit from the Republic of Ireland.\n- (1) Refer to the Non-IFRS financial measures appendix for details of notable items.",

        "page_content": "## Group Chief Executive's review\n\nNatWest Group performed well in 2023, delivering for our customers, our shareholders, and the wider UK economy.\n\nDespite the macroeconomic uncertainty, our customers remained resilient, navigating both inflation and rising interest rates. Throughout the year, we supported them to manage their finances, meeting our goal to help 2 million customers save over \u00a3100 for the first time (1) , and lent an additional \u00a39 billion to the UK economy. Our investment in digital and data capabilities continues to make it easier for our customers to manage their money, and for our colleagues to provide great service.\n\nAs we look to 2024 and beyond, I am optimistic about the opportunities ahead for NatWest Group, building on our UK heritage, leading customer businesses, deep regional connections and financial strength.  It is therefore an honour to be asked to lead the bank and to have the opportunity to shape the future of NatWest Group.\n\n## Business performance\n\nOur overall operating profit of \u00a36.2 billion was up 20% on 2022 and our return on tangible equity was 17.8%, compared with 12.3% at the end of 2022. Income, excluding notable items, was up 10% on 2022 at \u00a314.3 billion, with costs up 5%.\n\nOur disciplined approach to capital allocation and balance sheet management delivered attractive returns and distributions for our shareholders in 2023. We announced \u00a33.6 billion of capital returns to shareholders, including an interim dividend of 5.5p at the half year and a proposed final dividend of 11.5p, bringing the total for 2023 to 17.0p, representing a 26% increase on 2022.\n\nOur business performance was grounded in helping customers. In 2023, we increased our lending to customers by \u00a39 billion, opened over 100,000 new start-up accounts for entrepreneurs, and over a million new personal current accounts, as well as helping 379,000 Retail banking customers to buy or re-mortgage their home.\n\nWe also made progress against our Climate transition plan in 2023, helping to build a more sustainable economy. We are working to support our customers' transition to net zero across a range of sectors and we have been a leading loan arranger to the UK power infrastructure (2) and renewables sector over the last 10 years (3) . We have now provided \u00a361.9 billion in climate and sustainable funding and financing against our target of \u00a3100 billion between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025.\n\n## Supporting our customers\n\nDuring a year of macroeconomic uncertainty, we focused on supporting our customers to better manage their finances. In 2023, we helped six million customers by conducting financial health checks, providing improved personal insights on credit scores, and helping customers to save for the first time. We were also one of the first high street banks to sign up to the Mortgage Charter in July 2023 to ease the pressure of increasing mortgage costs, and we allowed our customers to lock in their next mortgage up to six months before the end of a fixed-rate deal.\n\nOver 1.5 million new savings accounts were opened in 2023. By making our fixed term savings accounts available to more people, including those without an existing account with NatWest Group, and providing a broad range of flexible savings accounts, we met our goal to help two million people save more than \u00a3100 for the first time.\n\nWe are the biggest supporter of UK businesses, serving more than 1.5 million business across the country. During 2023, our extensive network of relationship managers continued to help corporate customers grow, manage costs, find the right funding solutions, and reduce risk in volatile markets. In the context of macroeconomic volatility, we also provided centralised resources such as a cashflow tool, energy calculator and supply chain navigator to manage costs, in response to business customers' demand for help on managing high energy prices. In response to broader concerns from our SME customers, we collaborated with the Federation of Small Business to give them access to independent support and advice on topics such as obtaining funding and managing late payments.\n\nOur 19 million customer base means we are well placed to support our customers to make sustainable choices, while driving value and growth from the commercial opportunities arising from the transition to a net-zero economy. Through initiatives such as partnering with WWF-UK and food manufacturer McCain we are reducing financial barriers for farmers transitioning to sustainable agricultural practices. Through Lombard, no.1 in UK asset finance, we supported customers with financing for electric vehicles, renewables, and cleaner energy alternatives.\n\n## Simple for customers\n\nWe want to make it easier for customers to do business with us and are investing in technology and partnerships to be a simple, safe, and smart bank, driven by data and digital innovation.\n\nIn 2023, our Retail Banking mobile app was used by more than 9.8 million customers and there were 10.9 million active digital users (4) of our online and mobile banking platforms. 94% of our retail customer needs are now met digitally - up from 53% in 2019. In Commercial & Institutional, 86% of customers are now actively using digital channels to interact with us, and our innovative card and payments solution, Tyl, continued to grow. We were one of the first banks to offer Apple and Android Tap to Pay, a low-cost service removing the need for businesses to use hardware to accept payments.\n\nWe are also making it easier and quicker for our business customers to access financing with the launch of a new online lending platform, enabling customers to apply for a loan digitally in a matter of minutes.\n\nBy harnessing digital capabilities, we have also improved our customer service and productivity. In 2023, we collaborated with technology partners to responsibly use artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance customer engagement and improve efficiency. This led to the development of new AI capabilities, analysing customer behaviour to help us detect scams and fraud earlier to reduce financial loss.",

In 2024, we will focus on disciplined growth, improving bank-wide simplification to make it easier to do business with us, and deploying capital efficiently while maintaining strong risk management to drive strong capital generation. This will enable us to continue supporting our customers, reinvest in the business, generate attractive distributions to shareholders, and make a meaningful contribution to the UK economy.\n\n## Paul Thwaite\n\n## Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n- (1) 2020 goal: To help two million customers save over \u00a3100 for the first time with NatWest Group since 2020.\n- (2)\n- Power infrastructure comprise battery storage, electricity distribution, electricity smart meter and electricity transmission.\n- (3) NatWest Group ranked first among Loan Arrangers by deal value for the period 2014-2023.

        "page_content": "## Business performance summary continued\n\n## Chief Financial Officer review\n\nWe have delivered a strong operating performance in 2023 with a RoTE of 17.8%, above our guided range. Total income excluding notable items of \u00a314.3 billion was up by 9.8% on prior year and levels of default remain stable across our portfolio, with a net impairment charge of 15 basis points of gross customer loans. We remain focused on cost discipline and have achieved our cost target of around \u00a37.6 billion, with a cost:income ratio of 51.8%.\n\nOur robust balance sheet has allowed us to continue to lend to our personal and business customers despite a competitive environment for deposits. We retain strong liquidity and capital positions with an LCR of 144%, representing \u00a345.4 billion headroom above 100% minimum requirement, and an LDR (excl. repos and reverse repos) of 84%. CET1 ratio was 13.4%, with total distributions deducted from capital of \u00a33.6 billion, around 200 basis points of CET1, or c.40 pence per share. TNAV per share increased by 28 pence to 292 pence.\n\n## Financial performance\n\nTotal income increased by 12.1% to \u00a314.8 billion compared with 2022. Total income excluding notable items of \u00a314.3 billion was 9.8% higher than the prior year principally driven by lending growth, higher income in our markets business and favourable yield curve movements partially offset by the change in deposit mix from non-interest bearing to interest bearing and lower deposit balances.\n\nBank NIM of 3.04% was 19 basis points higher than 2022 primarily due to benefits from yield curve movements, net of changes in deposit mix, partially offset by lending margin pressure. Q4 2023 Bank NIM was 2.86%, 8 basis points down in the quarter reflecting asset margin pressure of 2 basis points and deposit balance and mix impacts of 6 basis points.\n\nTotal operating expenses were \u00a3309 million higher than 2022. Other operating expenses were \u00a3339 million, or 4.6%, higher for the year at \u00a37.6 billion, in line with our full year guidance. The increase was principally due to higher staff costs, including a payment to support our colleagues with cost of living challenges and inflationary pressures on utility and contract costs. In addition, depreciation and amortisation costs increased by \u00a3101 million reflecting capitalised technology investment and a property impairment. FTE (1) reduced by c.300 to c.61,200 principally reflecting reductions as we continue our exit from the Republic of Ireland and automation and simplification in Retail Banking, partially offset by investment in technology and data roles.\n\nA net impairment charge of \u00a3578 million, or 15 basis points of gross customer loans, primarily reflects continued low and stable levels of stage 3 defaults across the portfolio and good book charges related to unsecured lending. Compared with 2022, our ECL provision increased by \u00a30.2 billion to \u00a33.6 billion and our ECL coverage ratio has increased from 0.91% to 0.93%. We retain post model adjustments of \u00a30.4 billion related to economic uncertainty, or 11.8% of total impairment provisions. Whilst we are comfortable with the strong credit performance of our book, we will assess this position regularly and are closely monitoring the impacts of inflationary pressures on the UK economy and our customers.\n\nAs a result, we are pleased to report an attributable profit for 2023 of \u00a34.4 billion, with earnings per share of 47.9 pence and a RoTE of 17.8%, above our guided range, the profit for the year includes a deferred tax asset write back of \u00a3385 million in respect of tax losses.\n\nNet loans to customers excluding central items increased by \u00a38.9 billion in the year largely reflecting a \u00a37.6 billion increase in Retail Banking and \u00a32.0 billion of growth in Commercial & Institutional due to an increase in term loan facilities and private financing within Corporate & Institutions, net of \u00a32.7 billion of UK Government scheme repayments. Retail Banking mortgage lending increased by \u00a35.9 billion, with gross new mortgage lending of \u00a329.8 billion in 2023 compared with \u00a341.4 billion in 2022 reflecting the smaller mortgage market, and unsecured lending increased by \u00a32.0 billion with continued strong customer demand. Private Banking net loans to customers decreased by \u00a30.7 billion driven by higher repayments on mortgages.\n\nUp to 31 December 2023 we have provided \u00a361.9 billion against our target to provide \u00a3100 billion climate and sustainable funding and financing between 1 July 2021 and the end of 2025. As part of this we aim to provide at least \u00a310 billion in lending for residential properties with Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) ratings A and B between 1 January 2023 and the end of 2025. During 2023 we provided \u00a329.3 billion climate and sustainable funding and financing, which included \u00a33.9 billion in lending for residential properties with EPC ratings A and B.\n\nCustomer deposits excluding central items decreased by \u00a313.8 billion during 2023 to \u00a3419.1 billion principally reflecting the competitive environment for deposits and an overall market liquidity contraction. In the fourth quarter customer deposit balances reduced by \u00a34.5 billion largely within Corporate & Institutions as a result of active management, with growth in Retail Banking and Private Banking partially offsetting. We have continued to see the mix of our book shift towards interest bearing and term balances, with non-interest bearing balances now accounting for 34% of balances and term at 16%, although the movement was broadly in line with our expectations and the guidance we provided at our Q3 results announcement.\n\nTNAV per share increased by 28 pence in the year to 292 pence primarily reflecting the attributable profit for the period and an \u00a3872 million movement in cash flow hedging reserves as rate expectations lowered, partially offset by the impact of distributions. Intangible assets increased by \u00a3498 million in the year primarily reflecting software capitalisation and the acquisition of Cushon.\n\n- (1) Full Time Equivalents of our permanent and internal fixed term resource.

The 80 basis point reduction compared with 31 December 2022 principally reflected distributions deducted from capital of c.200 basis points, and increased RWAs of c.50 basis points, partially offset by the attributable profit, NatWest Group's minimum requirement for own funds and eligible liabilities (MREL) ratio was 30.5%.\n\nRWAs increased by \u00a36.9 billion during 2023 to \u00a3183.0 billion principally reflecting lending growth in Commercial & Institutional and a \u00a33.0 billion uplift associated with CRD IV model updates, partially offset by a \u00a34.0 billion reduction as we continue our exit from the Republic of Ireland.\n\n## Funding and liquidity\n\nThe LCR of 144%, representing \u00a345.4 billion headroom above 100% minimum requirement, decreased by 1 percentage point during the year, driven by growth in customer lending and reduced customer deposits offset by an increase in wholesale funding and UBIDAC asset sale.",

Retail Banking delivered operating profit of \u00a32.6 billion and a return on equity of 23.8%, against a more challenging operating environment and inflationary cost impacts. Retail Banking provided \u00a33.7 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing in 2023 from lending to properties with an EPC rating of A or B.\n\n## 2023 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a3285 million, or 5.0%, higher than 2022 reflecting higher lending growth and the impact of rate rises on deposit income, partly offset by mortgage margin dilution, higher treasury funding costs and impact of the deposit balance mix shift from non-interest bearing current accounts to interest bearing term balances.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 6 basis points lower than 2022 largely reflecting the movements impacting total income, partly offset by the impact of pass-through management and hedges on deposit income as interest rates increased.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a3227 million, or 9.1%, higher than 2022 reflecting higher pay awards to support our colleagues with cost of living challenges, property lease termination losses, increased restructuring costs and continued investment in the business. This was partly offset by savings from a 6.3% reduction in headcount.\n- \uf02d An impairment charge of \u00a3465 million in 2023, \u00a3236 million higher than 2022, reflecting higher stage 3 inflows and increased good book charges driven by both lending growth and normalisation of risk parameters.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a37.6 billion, or 3.8%, in 2023 reflecting mortgage growth of \u00a35.9 billion, with gross new mortgage lending of \u00a329.8 billion, representing flow share of around 13%. Cards balances increased by \u00a31.5 billion and personal advances increased by \u00a30.5 billion in 2023 with continued strong customer demand.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a30.4 billion in 2023 reflecting lower current accounts of \u00a310.2 billion, partly offset by higher fixed term deposits driving savings growth of \u00a39.8 billion. Term deposits now represents 11% of deposit balances.\n- \uf02d RWAs increased by \u00a36.9 billion, or 12.6%, in 2023 driven by both lending growth in the period and IRB temporary model adjustments.\n\n## Q4 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a373 million, or 5.1%, lower than Q3 2023 reflecting timing of pass-through on interest bearing savings accounts, deposit balance mix shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing balances, continued mortgage margin dilution, as well as higher treasury funding costs, partly offset by increasing structural hedge benefit and higher fee income.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 17 basis points lower than Q3 2023 largely reflecting timing of pass-through on interest bearing savings accounts, deposit mix shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing balances and mortgage margin dilution, partly offset by increasing structural hedge benefit.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a374 million, or 10.3%, lower than Q3 2023 reflecting non repeat of property lease termination losses, partly offset by higher restructuring costs and the inclusion of the annual UK bank levy charge.\n- \uf02d An impairment charge of \u00a3103 million in Q4 2023 largely reflects stage 3 defaults, which remained broadly stable. Benefits from the Q4 IFRS 9 multiple economic scenarios (MES) update more than offset the impact of growth in unsecured lending, leading to lower good book charges in the quarter.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers balances were in line with Q3 2023 reflecting lower mortgage balances of \u00a30.4 billion with higher redemptions in the quarter offset by increases in Cards balances of \u00a30.3 billion and personal advances of \u00a30.1 billion with continued strong customer demand. Mortgage gross new lending of \u00a35.3 billion, representing flow share of around 10% in the quarter, down from around 13% in Q3 2023 as we sought to actively manage the balance sheet.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a33.5 billion, or 1.9%, in Q4 2023 reflecting growth in fixed term savings and instant access savings growth of \u00a35.4 billion, partially offset by lower current account balances of \u00a31.9 billion.\n- \uf02d RWAs increased by \u00a32.7 billion, or 4.6%, in Q4 2023 primarily due to IRB temporary model adjustments.",

AUMA was 22.2% higher at \u00a340.8 billion and is now greater than customer deposits of \u00a337.7 billion which fell as a result of competitive pressure and a change in customer behaviour. Private Banking provided \u00a30.2 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing in 2023, principally in relation to mortgages on residential properties with EPC A or B certificates.\n\n## 2023 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a366 million, or 6.3%, lower than 2022 reflecting lower deposit balances with mix shifting from non-interest bearing to interest bearing balances, as customers migrated to savings products offering higher returns, combined with reduced lending volumes and mortgage margin dilution.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 33 basis points lower than 2022 reflecting lower deposit balances with mix shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing balances and an increase in pass-through of interest rate increases to customers, partly offset by the impact of rate rises on deposit income.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a366 million, or 10.8%, higher than 2022 reflecting an increase in pay awards to support our colleagues with cost of living challenges, an additional VAT charge, property revaluation costs and strategic spend to increase operational efficiency.\n- \uf02d The impairment charge of \u00a314 million in 2023, compared with a \u00a32 million release in 2022, largely reflects non-recurrence of good book releases in 2022 whilst overall impairments remain at low levels.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers decreased by \u00a30.7 billion, or 3.6%, in 2023 as higher levels of customer repayments more than offset gross new lending.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a33.5 billion, or 8.5%, in 2023 reflecting an increase in competition and higher tax outflows in Q1 2023. Changes in customer behaviour drove a shift in mix of deposits with a decrease in instant access savings and current accounts, and a switch to term and notice accounts which now represent 30% of deposit balances.\n- \uf02d AUMA increased by \u00a37.4 billion to \u00a340.8 billion, reflecting net inflows of \u00a31.3 billion for AUM, and \u00a30.4 billion AUA: strong market performance of \u00a33.4 billion and \u00a32.3 billion Cushon balances following the acquisition in June 2023.\n\n## Q4 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a35 million, or 2.3%, lower than Q3 2023 reflecting the impacts of changes in deposit product mix as customers continue to shift from non-interest bearing to interest bearing balances along with lower lending volumes offset in part by an increase in deposit volumes and improved mortgage margins.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 8 basis points lower than Q3 2023 largely reflecting the continued change in the deposit book mix partially offset by improved lending margins and an increase in deposit volumes.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a351 million, or 32.5%, higher than Q3 2023 primarily reflecting the inclusion of the annual UK bank levy charge, an additional VAT charge and strategic spend to increase operational efficiency.\n- \uf02d A net impairment charge of \u00a35 million in Q4 2023 largely reflects good book charges whilst stage 3 defaults remain at low levels.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers decreased by \u00a30.3 billion, or 1.6%, in Q4 2023 driven by higher customer mortgage repayments.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits increased by \u00a30.5 billion, or 1.3%, compared with Q3 2023 driven by seasonal increases in instant access, partially offset by a reduction in current accounts.\n- \uf02d AUMA increased by \u00a32.6 billion in Q4 2023, driven by new inflows of \u00a30.3 billion AUM and positive market movements of \u00a32.1 billion.",

Commercial & Institutional provided \u00a325.4 billion of climate and sustainable funding and financing in 2023 to support customers investing in the transition to net zero.\n\n## 2023 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a31,008 million, or 15.7%, higher than 2022 primarily reflecting higher deposit returns supported by interest rate rises, growth in lending and higher markets income partly offset by higher funding costs.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 53 basis points higher than 2022 reflecting higher deposit returns partly offset by higher funding costs.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a3304 million, or 8.5%, higher than 2022 reflecting higher pay awards to support our colleagues with cost of living challenges and continued investment in the business.\n- \uf02d An impairment charge of \u00a394 million in 2023, \u00a328 million lower than 2022, reflecting good book releases and lower stage 3 charges.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a32.0 billion, or 1.5%, in 2023 reflecting an increase of \u00a34.7 billion from growth in private financing activity, an increase in term loan facilities including an increase in revolving credit utilisations within Corporate & Institutions and asset finance growth within Commercial Mid-market, partly offset by \u00a32.7 billion of UK Government scheme repayments.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a39.9 billion, or 4.9%, in 2023 primarily due to overall market liquidity contraction, particularly in Commercial Mid-market. We have seen strong growth in term deposits balances in 2023 which now represent 19% of deposit balances. Across the year we continued to see a reduction in non-interest bearing balances which now represent 36% of deposit balances.\n- \uf02d RWAs increased by \u00a34.2 billion, or 4.1%, in 2023 primarily reflecting lending facility growth, partly offset by capital optimisation activity and foreign exchange benefits.\n\n## Q4 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was broadly stable compared to Q3 2023.\n- \uf02d Net interest margin was 11 basis points lower than Q3 2023 largely reflecting non-repeat of one-off items in Q3 2023, deposit mix and higher funding costs.\n- \uf02d Other operating expenses were \u00a354 million, or 5.6%, higher than Q3 2023 largely due to the inclusion of the annual bank levy charge.\n- \uf02d An impairment charge of \u00a315 million in Q4 2023 reflects continued low levels of stage 3 charges largely offset by good book releases as a result of the Q4 2023 MES update.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a31.4 billion, or 1.1%, in Q4 2023 reflecting an increase of \u00a32.1 billion largely due to strong performance from private financing activity within Corporate & Institutions, partly offset by UK Government scheme repayments of \u00a30.7 billion.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased by \u00a38.4 billion, or 4.2%, in Q4 2023 primarily due to reductions in Corporate & Institutions as we managed down low value deposits.\n- \uf02d RWAs decreased by \u00a30.5 billion, or 0.5%, in Q4 2023 primarily due to lower market risk, lower traded risk and foreign exchange benefits, partially offset by lending facility growth and changes in book mix.",

Ulster Bank RoI customer deposit balances were \u00a30.2 billion as at Q4 2023.\n\n## Q4 performance\n\n- \uf02d Total income was \u00a3136 million higher than Q3 2023 primarily reflecting notable items including foreign exchange recycling gains and losses associated with property lease terminations in Q3 2023 not repeated in this quarter, partially offset with lower gains on interest and foreign exchange risk management derivatives not in accounting hedge relationships and lower business growth fund gains.\n- \uf02d Customer deposits decreased \u00a30.1 billion in the quarter mainly due to repo activity in Treasury.\n- \uf02d Net loans to customers increased by \u00a33.0 billion in Q4 2023 mainly due to reverse repo activity in Treasury.",

This reflected:\n\n- \uf02d The addition of deferred model calibration post model adjustments to account for elevated refinance risks on deteriorated exposures largely due to pressures from inflation and liquidity.\n- \uf02d The increase in the economic uncertainty post model adjustments for the Wholesale portfolios relating to inflation, supply chain and liquidity prompted by continued affordability risks, as a result of higher interest rates and sustained inflation.

Presentation of condensed consolidated financial statements\n\nThe condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with NatWest Group plc's 2023 Annual Report and Accounts. The critical and material accounting policies are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe directors have prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis after assessing the principal risks, forecasts, projections and other relevant evidence over the twelve months from the date they are approved.\n\n## 2. Tax\n\n## Analysis of the tax charge for the year\n\nThe tax charge comprises current and deferred tax in respect of profits and losses recognised or originating in the income statement. Tax on items originating outside the income statement is charged to other comprehensive income or direct to equity (as appropriate) and is therefore not reflected in the table below.\n\nCurrent tax is tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the year and any adjustments to tax payable in prior years.\n\n| Continuing operations                                                       | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   | 2021 \u00a3m   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Current tax                                                                 |           |           |           |\n| Charge for the year                                                         | (1,373)   | (1,611)   | (1,036)   |\n| (Under)/over provision in respect of prior years                            | (123)     | 100       | 31        |\n|                                                                             | (1,496)   | (1,511)   | (1,005)   |\n| Deferred tax                                                                |           |           |           |\n| (Charge)/credit for the year                                                | (281)     | 47        | (185)     |\n| UK tax rate change impact                                                   | -         | (10)      | 165       |\n| Net increase in the carrying value of deferred tax assets in respect of UK, |           |           |           |\n| RoI and Netherlands losses                                                  | 385       | 267       | 12        |\n| (Under)/over provision in respect of prior years                            | (42)      | (68)      | 17        |\n| Tax charge for the year                                                     | (1,434)   | (1,275)   | (996)     |\n\n## Judgement: tax contingencies\n\nNatWest Group's corporate income tax charge and its provisions for corporate income taxes necessarily involve a degree of estimation and judgement. The tax treatment of some transactions is uncertain and tax computations are yet to be agreed with the relevant tax authorities. NatWest Group recognises anticipated tax liabilities based on all available evidence and, where appropriate, in the light of external advice. Any difference between the final outcome and the amounts provided will affect current and deferred income tax charges in the period when the matter is resolved.\n\n## Deferred tax\n\nDeferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable in respect of temporary differences where the carrying amount of an asset or liability differs for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax liabilities reflect the expected amount of tax payable in the future on these temporary differences. Deferred tax assets reflect the expected amount of tax recoverable in the future on these differences. The net deferred tax asset recognised by the NatWest Group is shown below. The reduction of deferred tax asset is primarily attributable to reduced cash flow hedge liabilities, and is taken in other comprehensive income as part of the movements in cash flow reserves.\n\n## Analysis of deferred tax\n\n|                        | 2023 \u00a3m   | 2022 \u00a3m   |\n|------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Deferred tax asset     | (1,894)   | (2,178)   |\n| Deferred tax liability | 141       | 227       |\n| Net deferred tax asset | (1,753)   | (1,951)   |",

The remaining migrations are expected to be complete in 2024.\n\nAgreement with Elmscott Property Finance DAC / AB CarVal (CarVal) for the sale of a portfolio which consists mostly of non-performing mortgages, unsecured personal loans and commercial facilities with a gross value of c. \u20ac690 million. Pepper Finance Corporation (Ireland) DAC will become the legal owner and servicer of the facilities.\n\nIn November 2023, c.\u20ac400 million of exposures transferred to Pepper Finance Corporation (Ireland) DAC, with the remainder of the portfolio expected to transfer in 2024.\n\nThe business activities relating to these sales that meet the requirements of IFRS 5 are presented as a discontinued operation and as a disposal group.

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## 4. Litigation and regulatory matters\n\nNatWest Group plc and certain members of NatWest Group are party to various legal proceedings and are involved in, or subject to, various regulatory matters, including as the subject of investigations and other regulatory and governmental action (Matters) in the United Kingdom (UK), the United States (US), the European Union (EU) and other jurisdictions. Note 26 in the NatWest Group plc 2023 Annual Report and Accounts, issued on 16 February 2024 and available at natwestgroup.com (Note 26), discusses the Matters in which NatWest Group is currently involved and material developments. Other than the Matters discussed in Note 26, no member of NatWest Group is or has been involved in governmental, legal, or regulatory proceedings (including those which are pending or threatened) that are expected to be material, individually or in aggregate. Recent developments in the Matters identified in Note 26 that have occurred since the Q3 2023 Interim Management Statement was issued on 27 October 2023, include, but are not limited to, those set out below.\n\n## Litigation\n\n## London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other rates litigation\n\nIn August 2020, a complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California by several United States retail borrowers against the USD ICE LIBOR panel banks and their affiliates (including NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc, NWMSI and NWB Plc), alleging (i) that the very process of setting USD ICE LIBOR amounts to illegal price-fixing; and (ii) that banks in the United States have illegally agreed to use LIBOR as a component of price in variable retail loans. In September 2022, the district court dismissed the complaint. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint but in October 2023, the district court dismissed that complaint as well, and indicated that further amendment would not be permitted. The plaintiffs have commenced an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which is currently pending.\n\n## FX litigation\n\nIn July and December 2019, two separate applications seeking opt-out collective proceedings orders were filed in the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other banks. Both applications were brought on behalf of persons who, between 18 December 2007 and 31 January 2013, entered into a relevant FX spot or outright forward transaction in the EEA with a relevant financial institution or on an electronic communications network. In March 2022, the CAT declined to certify as collective proceedings either of the applications, which was appealed by the applicants, and the subject of an application for judicial review.\n\nIn its amended judgment in November 2023, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and decided that the claims should proceed on an opt-out basis. Separately, the court determined which of the two competing applicants can proceed as class representative, and dismissed the application for judicial review of the CAT's decision. The case has been remitted to the CAT for further case management and the banks have sought permission to appeal directly to the UK Supreme Court.\n\nIn December 2021, a summons was served in the Netherlands against NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and NWM N.V. by Stichting FX Claims on behalf of a number of parties, seeking declarations from the court concerning liability for anti-competitive FX market conduct described in decisions of the European Commission (EC) of 16 May 2019, along with unspecified damages. The claimant amended its claim to also refer to a 2 December 2021 decision by the EC, which described anti-competitive FX market conduct. NatWest Group plc, NWM Plc and other defendants contested the jurisdiction of the Dutch court. In March 2023, the district court in Amsterdam accepted that it has jurisdiction to hear claims against NWM N.V. but refused jurisdiction to hear any claims against the other defendant banks (including NatWest Group plc and NWM Plc) brought on behalf of the parties represented by the claimant that are domiciled outside of the Netherlands. The claimant is appealing that decision and the defendant banks have brought cross-appeals which seek a ruling that the Dutch court has no jurisdiction to hear any claims against the defendant banks domiciled outside of the Netherlands, including claims brought on behalf of the parties represented by the claimant that are domiciled in the Netherlands.\n\nIn September 2023, second summonses were served by Stichting FX Claims on NWM N.V., NatWest Group plc and NWM Plc, for claims on behalf of a new group of parties that have now been brought before the district court in Amsterdam. The summonses seek declarations from the Dutch court concerning liability for anti-competitive FX market conduct described in the above referenced decisions of the EC of 16 May 2019 and 2 December 2021, along with unspecified damages.\n\n## Government securities antitrust litigation\n\nNWMSI and certain other US broker-dealers are defendants in a consolidated antitrust class action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) on behalf of persons who transacted in US Treasury securities or derivatives based on such instruments, including futures and options. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants rigged the US Treasury securities auction bidding process to deflate prices at which they bought such securities and colluded to increase the prices at which they sold such securities to the plaintiffs. In March 2022, the SDNY dismissed the complaint, without leave to re-plead. In February 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the SDNY's decision dismissing the complaint.\n\n## Swaps antitrust litigation\n\nNWM Plc and other members of NatWest Group, including NatWest Group plc, as well as a number of other interest rate swap dealers, are defendants in several cases pending in the SDNY alleging violations of the US antitrust laws in the market for interest rate swaps. There is a consolidated class action complaint on behalf of persons who entered into interest rate swaps with the defendants, as well as non-class action claims by three swap execution facilities (TeraExchange, Javelin, and trueEx). The plaintiffs allege that the swap execution facilities would have successfully established exchange-like trading of interest rate swaps if the defendants had not unlawfully conspired to prevent that from happening through boycotts and other means. Discovery in these cases is complete. In December 2023, the SDNY denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification. The plaintiffs have filed a petition requesting that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit review the denial of class certification.",

        "page_content": "## Notes\n\n## 4. Litigation and regulatory matters continued\n\nIn June 2021, a class action antitrust complaint was filed against a number of credit default swap dealers, in New Mexico federal court on behalf of persons who, from 2005 onwards, settled credit default swaps in the United States by reference to the ISDA credit default swap auction protocol. The complaint alleges that the defendants conspired to manipulate that benchmark through various means in violation of the antitrust laws and the Commodity Exchange Act. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint and, in June 2023, such motion was denied as regards NWMSI and other financial institutions, but granted as regards to NWM Plc on the ground that the court lacks jurisdiction over that entity. As a result, the case entered the discovery phase as against the non-dismissed defendants. In January 2024, the SDNY issued an order barring the plaintiffs in the New Mexico case from pursuing claims based on conduct occurring before 30 June 2014 on the ground that such claims were extinguished by a 2015 settlement agreement that resolved a prior class action relating to credit default swaps.\n\n## EUA trading litigation\n\nNWM Plc was a named defendant in civil proceedings before the High Court of Justice of England and Wales brought in 2015 by ten companies (all in liquidation) (the 'Liquidated Companies') and their respective liquidators (together, 'the Claimants'). The Liquidated Companies previously traded in European Union Allowances (EUAs) in 2009 and were alleged to be VAT defaulting traders within (or otherwise connected to) EUA supply chains of which NWM Plc was a party. In March 2020, the court held that NWM Plc and Mercuria Energy Europe Trading Limited ('Mercuria') were liable for dishonestly assisting and knowingly being a party to fraudulent trading during a seven business day period in 2009.\n\nIn October 2020, the High Court quantified total damages against NWM Plc and Mercuria at \u00a345 million plus interest and costs, and permitted the defendants to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In May 2021 the Court of Appeal set aside the High Court's judgment and ordered that a retrial take place before a different High Court judge. In January 2024, NWM Plc entered into an agreement to resolve the claim against it. The settlement amount paid by NWM Plc was covered in full by an existing provision.\n\n## 1MDB litigation\n\nA Malaysian court claim was served in Switzerland in November 2022 by 1MDB, a Sovereign Wealth Fund, in which Coutts & Co Ltd was named, along with six others, as a defendant in respect of losses allegedly incurred by 1MDB. It is claimed that Coutts & Co Ltd is liable as a constructive trustee for having dishonestly assisted the directors of 1MDB in the breach of their fiduciary duties by failing (amongst other alleged claims) to undertake due diligence in relation to a customer of Coutts & Co Ltd, through which funds totalling c.US$1 billion were received and paid out between 2009 and 2011. The claimant seeks the return of that amount plus interest. Coutts & Co Ltd filed an application in January 2023 challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian court's jurisdiction to hear the claim. Before that application was heard, in April 2023, the claimant filed a notice of discontinuance of its claim against certain defendants including Coutts & Co Ltd. The claimant subsequently indicated that it intended to issue further replacement proceedings. Coutts & Co Ltd challenged the claimant's ability to take that step. In August 2023, the court disallowed the discontinuation of the claim by the claimant (a decision that the claimant has appealed) and directed that the application by Coutts & Co Ltd challenging the validity of the proceedings should proceed to a hearing, which took place in February 2024. Judgment is awaited.\n\nCoutts & Co Ltd (a subsidiary of RBS Netherlands Holdings B.V., which in turn is a subsidiary of NWM Plc) is a company registered in Switzerland and is in wind-down following the announced sale of its business assets in 2015.\n\n## Regulatory matters\n\n## RBSI inspection report and referral to enforcement\n\nFollowing an inspection by the Isle of Man Financial Services Authority (IOMFSA) in 2021 into The Royal Bank of Scotland International Limited's (RBSI's) compliance with the Financial Services Rule Book 2016, the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Code 2015 (the '2015 Code') and the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Code 2019, RBSI and the IOMFSA entered into a settlement agreement in February 2024 with an agreed public statement that RBSI had contravened paragraph 7 of the 2015 Code. RBSI did not complete its updated Customer Risk Assessment process following the introduction of the 2015 Code until 2018, resulting in 2,239 non-personal customers (on-boarded to its Isle of Man branches between 2015 and 2018, and not rated as high risk) being on-boarded using Customer Risk Assessments in line with earlier legislation. This constituted less than 3% of the total customer population of the Isle of Man branches. RBSI was fined \u00a31.0 million (after a discount for co-operation), which was covered in full by an existing provision.\n\n## Reviews into customer account closures\n\nIn July 2023, NatWest Group plc commissioned an independent review by the law firm Travers Smith LLP into issues that had arisen from treatment of a customer in connection with an account closure decision that attracted significant public attention and certain related interactions with the media. NatWest Group plc has received reports in connection with that review (and in October and December 2023 published summaries of the key findings and recommendations).\n\nIn addition, NatWest Group plc is conducting internal reviews with respect to certain governance processes, policies, systems and controls of NatWest Group entities, including with respect to customer account closures.\n\nThe FCA is conducting supervisory work into how the governance, systems and controls of NatWest Group and Coutts & Company are working, to identify and address any significant shortcomings.",

        "page_content": "## Forward looking statements\n\n## Cautionary statement regarding forward-looking statements\n\nCertain sections in this document contain 'forward-looking statements' as that term is defined in the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, such as statements that include the words 'expect', 'estimate', 'project', 'anticipate', 'commit', 'believe', 'should', 'intend', 'will', 'plan', 'could', 'probability', 'risk', 'Value-at-Risk (VaR)', 'target', 'goal', 'objective', 'may', 'endeavour', 'outlook', 'optimistic', 'prospects' and similar expressions or variations on these expressions. In particular, this document includes forward-looking targets and guidance relating to financial performance measures, such as income growth, operating expense, RoTE, ROE, discretionary capital distribution targets, impairment loss rates, balance sheet reduction, including the reduction of RWAs, CET1 ratio (and key drivers of the CET1 ratio including timing, impact and details), Pillar 2 and other regulatory buffer requirements and MREL and non-financial performance measures, such as NatWest Group's initial area of focus, climate and sustainability-related performance ambitions, targets and metrics, including in relation to initiatives to transition to a net zero economy, Climate and Sustainable Funding and Financing (CSFF) and financed emissions. In addition, this document includes forward-looking statements relating, but not limited to: implementation of NatWest Group's strategy (including in relation to: cost-controlling measures, the Commercial & Institutional segment and achieving a number of various targets within the relevant timeframe); the timing and outcome of litigation and government and regulatory investigations; direct and on-market buy-backs; funding plans and credit risk profile; managing its capital position; liquidity ratio; portfolios; net interest margin and drivers related thereto; lending and income growth, product share and growth in target segments; impairments and write-downs; restructuring and remediation costs and charges; NatWest Group's exposure to political risk, economic assumptions and risk, climate, environmental and sustainability risk, operational risk, conduct risk, financial crime risk, cyber, data and IT risk and credit rating risk and to various types of market risk, including interest rate risk, foreign exchange rate risk and commodity and equity price risk; customer experience, including our Net Promoter Score; employee engagement and gender balance in leadership positions.\n\n## Limitations inherent to forward-looking statements\n\nThese statements are based on current plans, expectations, estimates, targets and projections, and are subject to significant inherent risks, uncertainties and other factors, both external and relating to NatWest Group's strategy or operations, which may result in NatWest Group being unable to achieve the current plans, expectations, estimates, targets, projections and other anticipated outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. In addition, certain of these disclosures are dependent on choices relying on key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations, including assumptions and estimates made by management. By their nature, certain of these disclosures are only estimates and, as a result, actual future results, gains or losses could differ materially from those that have been estimated. Accordingly, undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date we make them and we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements contained herein, whether to reflect any change in our expectations with regard thereto, any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based, or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.\n\n## Important factors that could affect the actual outcome of the forward-looking statements\n\nWe caution you that a large number of important factors could adversely affect our results or our ability to implement our strategy, cause us to fail to meet our targets, predictions, expectations and other anticipated outcomes or affect the accuracy of forwardlooking statements described in this document. These factors include, but are not limited to, those set forth in the risk factors and the other uncertainties described in NatWest Group plc's Annual Report on Form 20-F and its other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The principal risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect NatWest Group's future results, its financial condition and/or prospects and cause them to be materially different from what is forecast or expected, include, but are not limited to: economic and political risk (including in respect of: political and economic risks and uncertainty in the UK and global markets, including due to GDP growth, inflation and interest rates, political uncertainty and instability, supply chain disruption and geopolitical tensions and armed conflict); changes in foreign currency exchange rates; uncertainty regarding the effects of Brexit; and HM Treasury's ownership as the largest shareholder of NatWest Group plc); strategic risk (including in respect of the implementation of NatWest Group's strategy; future acquisitions and divestments (including the phased withdrawal from ROI), and the transfer of its Western European corporate portfolio); financial resilience risk (including in respect of: NatWest Group's ability to meet targets and to make discretionary capital distributions; the competitive environment; counterparty and borrower risk; liquidity and funding risks; prudential regulatory requirements for capital and MREL; reductions in the credit ratings; the requirements of regulatory stress tests; model risk; sensitivity to accounting policies, judgements, estimates and assumptions (and the economic, climate, competitive and other forward looking information affecting those judgements, estimates and assumptions); changes in applicable accounting standards; the value or effectiveness of credit protection; the adequacy of NatWest Group's future assessments by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Bank of England; and the application of UK statutory stabilisation or resolution powers); climate and sustainability risk (including in respect of: risks relating to climate-related  and sustainability-related risks; both the execution and reputational risk relating to NatWest Group's climate change-related strategy, ambitions, targets and transition plan; climate and sustainability-related data and model risk; the failure to implement climate change resilient governance, systems, controls and procedures; increasing levels of climate, environmental, human rights and sustainability-related regulation and oversight; increasing anti-greenwashing regulations; climate, environmental and sustainability-related litigation, enforcement proceedings investigations and conduct risk; and reductions in ESG ratings); operational and IT resilience risk (including in respect of: operational risks (including reliance on third party suppliers); cyberattacks; the accuracy and effective use of data; complex IT systems; attracting, retaining and developing diverse senior management and skilled personnel; NatWest Group's risk management framework; and reputational risk); and legal, regulatory and conduct risk (including in respect of: the impact of substantial regulation and oversight; the outcome of legal, regulatory and governmental actions, investigations and remedial undertakings; and changes in tax legislation or failure to generate future taxable profits).",

        "page_content": "## Climate and sustainability-related disclosures\n\nClimate and sustainability-related disclosures in this document are not measures within the scope of International Financial Reporting Standards ('IFRS'), use a greater number and level of judgements, assumptions and estimates, including with respect to the classification of climate and sustainable funding and financing activities, than our reporting of historical financial information in accordance with IFRS. These judgements, assumptions and estimates are highly likely to change materially over time, and, when coupled with the longer time frames used in these disclosures, make any assessment of materiality inherently uncertain. In addition, our climate risk analysis, net zero strategy, including the implementation of our climate transition plan remain under development, and the data underlying our analysis and strategy remain subject to evolution over time. The process we have adopted to define, gather and report data on our performance on climate and sustainability-related measures is not subject to the formal processes adopted for financial reporting in accordance with IFRS and there are currently limited industry standards or globally recognised established practices for measuring and defining climate and sustainability-related metrics. As a result, we expect that certain climate and sustainability-related disclosures made in this document are likely to be amended, updated, recalculated or restated in the future. Please also refer to the cautionary statement in the section entitled 'Climate-related and other forward-looking statements and metrics' of the NatWest Group 2023 Climate-related Disclosures Report.\n\n## Cautionary statement regarding Non-IFRS financial measures and APMs\n\nNatWest Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). This document may contain financial measures and ratios not specifically defined under GAAP or IFRS ('Non-IFRS') and/or alternative performance measures ('APMs') as defined in European Securities and Markets Authority ('ESMA') guidelines. Non-IFRS measures and APMs are adjusted for notable and other defined items which management believes are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period comparison. Non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. Any Non-IFRS measures and/or APMs included in this document, are not measures within the scope of IFRS, are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and change, and are not a substitute for IFRS measures.\n\nThe information, statements and opinions contained in this document do not constitute a public offer under any applicable legislation or an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or financial instruments or any advice or recommendation with respect to such securities or other financial instruments.",

This document contains a number of non-IFRS measures, also known as alternative performance measures, defined under the European Securities and Markets Authority guidance or non-GAAP financial measures in accordance with SEC regulations. These measures are adjusted for notable and other defined items which management believes are not representative of the underlying performance of the business and which distort period-on-period comparison.\n\nThe non-IFRS measures provide users of the financial statements with a consistent basis for comparing business performance between financial periods and information on elements of performance that are one-off in nature. The non-IFRS measures also include a calculation of metrics that are used throughout the banking industry.\n\nThese non-IFRS measures are not a substitute for IFRS measures and a reconciliation to the closest IFRS measure is presented where appropriate.\n\n## 1. Total income excluding notable items\n\nTotal income excluding notable items is calculated as total income less notable items.\n\nThe exclusion of notable items aims to remove the impact of one-offs and other volatile items which may distort period-on-period comparisons.\n\n|                                                                              | Year ended          | Year ended          | Quarter ended       | Quarter ended        | Quarter ended       |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|\n|                                                                              | 31 December 2023 \u00a3m | 31 December 2022 \u00a3m | 31 December 2023 \u00a3m | 30 September 2023 \u00a3m | 31 December 2022 \u00a3m |\n| Continuing operations                                                        |                     |                     |                     |                      |                     |\n| Total income                                                                 | 14,752              | 13,156              | 3,537               | 3,488                | 3,708               |\n| Less notable items:                                                          |                     |                     |                     |                      |                     |\n| Commercial & Institutional                                                   |                     |                     |                     |                      |                     |\n| Fair value, disposal losses and asset disposals/strategic risk reduction     | -                   | (45)                | -                   | -                    | -                   |\n| Own credit adjustments (OCA)                                                 | (2)                 | 42                  | (5)                 | (6)                  | (19)                |\n| Tax interest on prior periods                                                | 3                   | -                   | 3                   | -                    | -                   |\n| Central items & other                                                        |                     |                     |                     |                      |                     |\n| Loss on redemption of own debt                                               | -                   | (161)               | -                   | -                    | -                   |\n| Effective interest rate adjustment as a result of redemption of own debt     | -                   | (41)                | -                   | -                    | (41)                |\n| Profit from insurance liabilities settlement                                 | -                   | 92                  | -                   | -                    | 92                  |\n| Liquidity Asset Bond sale losses                                             | (43)                | (88)                | (10)                | (9)                  | -                   |\n| Share of associate (losses)/gains for Business Growth Fund                   | (4)                 | (22)                | 1                   | 10                   | 7                   |\n| Property strategy update                                                     | (69)                | -                   | -                   | (69)                 | -                   |\n| Interest and FX management derivatives not in hedge accounting relationships | 79                  | 369                 | (21)                | 48                   | (46)                |\n| FX recycling gains                                                           | 484                 | -                   | 162                 | -                    | -                   |\n| Ulster Bank Rol fair value mortgage adjustments                              | -                   | (51)                | -                   | -                    | (51)                |\n| Tax interest on prior periods                                                | (35)                | -                   | (35)                | -                    | -                   |\n|                                                                              | 413                 | 95                  | 95                  | (26)                 | (58)                |\n| Total income excluding notable items                                         | 14,339              | 13,061              | 3,442               | 3,514                | 3,766               |",

Cost: income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct)\n\nNatWest Group uses cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) in the Outlook guidance. This is calculated as other operating expenses (total operating expenses less litigation and conduct costs) divided by total income. Litigation and conduct costs are excluded as they are one-off in nature, difficult to forecast for Outlook purposes and distort period-on-period comparisons.\n\nThe calculation of the cost:income ratio (excl. litigation and conduct) is shown below, along with a comparison to cost:income ratio calculated using total operating expenses.\n\n| Year ended 31 December 2023                      |

Bank net interest margin\n\nBank net interest margin is annualised net interest income, as a percentage of bank average interest-earning assets. Bank average interest earning assets are the average interest earning assets of the banking business of NatWest Group excluding liquid asset buffer.\n\nLiquid asset buffer consists of assets held by NatWest Group, such as cash and balances at central banks and debt securities in issue, that can be used to ensure repayment of financial obligations as they fall due. The exclusion of liquid asset buffer presents net interest margin on a basis more comparable with UK peers and excludes the impact of regulatory driven factors. A reconciliation is shown below including a comparison to the nearest GAAP measure; net interest margin. This is net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets.\n\n|                                                 | Year ended or as at   | Year ended or as at   | Quarter ended or
