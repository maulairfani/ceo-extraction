Being a force for good entails a multifaceted approach that extends across our entire value chain. From fostering inclusive growth and empowering local communities to mitigating environmental impact and creating prosperity for our nation and its people, our commitment to operating responsibly is woven into the fabric of our business endeavours. It is part of our DNA and our legacy. It de/uniFB01nes who we are.\n\nBy creating value for all stakeholdersshareholders, employees, customers, and society at large - we aim to nurture an ecosystem of mutual bene/uniFB01t and collective advancement. This philosophy underpins our unwavering dedication to ethical governance, transparent communication, and responsible business practices. As we navigate the complexities of a rapidly evolving world, we remain steadfast in our commitment to being agents of positive change.\n\nGuided by our Purpose 'To enrich lives, by building dynamic and responsible businesses and institutions, that inspire trust', and by leveraging our resources, expertise, and in/uniFB02uence, we aspire to be a catalyst for meaningful impact, shaping a future where business serves as a force for good in everything that we touch and do.\n\n## Global Economy: Resilience in Motion\n\nThe global economy exhibited remarkable resilience and divergence during 2023, defying fears of stag/uniFB02ation and recession. Increased government spending, notable labour force participation, and continued household consumption growth supported global economic growth last year. Despite substantial interest rate hikes by central banks, economic activities worldwide grew steadily, buoyed by household demand fuelled by pandemic savings\n\nand supportive policies in mortgage and housing markets. These growth drivers mitigated the impact of policy rate increases. Major central banks, led by the US Federal Reserve, have likely reached their peak rate hikes. Expectations are for rate cut initiations during the latter part of 2024, signalling cautious optimism for the global economy and /uniFB01nancial markets. Global economic growth is estimated at 3.2% in 2023 and projected to continue at the same pace in 2024 and 2025, albeit these growth rates are at historically low levels.\n\nThe US economy was a standout in 2023, with GDP growth exceeding long-run averages at 4.9% in Q3 and 3.4% in Q4, driven by robust services growth and a resurgence in manufacturing activity. Simultaneously, as the Fed raised rates and supply constraints eased, in/uniFB02ation declined to 1.7% in Q4, undershooting the 2% target. This 'miracle' of strong growth and low in/uniFB02ation de/uniFB01ed the recessionary predictions of most economists.\n\nIn contrast, Europe slowed to just 0.4% GDP growth in 2023, weighed down by reduced household spending from elevated energy costs tied to the RussiaUkraine con/uniFB02ict and tighter monetary policy. Prospects for 2024 remain subdued at 0.8% growth, constrained by strained /uniFB01scal positions limiting any growth impetus.\n\nChina experienced a 5.2% growth rate in 2023 and is projected to expand by 5% in 2024 and 4.5% in 2025, bolstered by policy support measures. However, a protracted property crisis remains a major drag on growth.\n\nGlobal economic prospects have improved as major economies have averted a severe downturn, reducing in/uniFB02ation without raising unemployment. However, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic. Persistent challenges include prolonged high interest rates, debt sustainability issues, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and escalating\n\nclimate risks, all of which continue to impede growth.\n\n## India: Leading the Way\n\nYet, for India, the picture is promising amidst a globally uncertain macroeconomic environment. India's economy has shown resilience, with real GDP growth of 8.2% in 2023-24, making it the fastest-growing major economy and the /uniFB01fth-largest globally. Structural reforms and domestic household demand are key drivers of India's growth. In/uniFB02ation has eased, supported by monetary policy actions and supply-side interventions. India is expected to grow at 7.2% per cent in FY25.\n\nThe banking sector has seen improvements in earnings, governance, and balance sheets. Non-banking /uniFB01nancial companies (NBFCs) also show sound performance, contributing to credit growth in the private sector. Prudent policies and regulatory measures aim to safeguard /uniFB01nancial stability in India. The Indian Rupee has managed relative stability supported by improved external balances, including a moderation in the current account de/uniFB01cit and robust forex reserves. Increased services exports have been supportive of the external balance. India's FinTech ecosystem, supported by initiatives like the Uni/uniFB01ed Payments Interface (UPI), has transformed /uniFB01nancial services, promoting inclusion and digitisation.\n\nHence, despite global challenges, the Indian economy is poised for sustained growth. We believe collective actions and focused measures by the government have helped overcome past challenges and will realise India's growth potential in the future. To summarise, the Indian economy has demonstrated resilience, supported by reforms, low core in/uniFB02ation, and a sound /uniFB01nancial sector. Continued focus on reforms will see India emerge as a key global growth engine.",

In addition, 14,000+ ABGites were covered through outreach programmes, done closer to the employees in our units/ o/ffices all over the globe. Robust digital learning, enabled 81% of the employees to learn at their convenience around topics of interest and need.\n\nOur leaders play a crucial role in strengthening the succession pipeline. Through Business and Functional Talent Councils, they set the vision for their respective areas, identify the future capabilities needed for success, review the availability of talent, and agree on actions to enhance the talent pipeline. This year, over 12,000 employees (99% of the eligible population) underwent potential assessments, enabling us to identify high-potential talent across all levels and prepare them for leadership succession. As a result, 56% of critical mid and senior-level positions were /uniFB01lled through our internal pipeline. Additionally, the internal and external hiring ratio for senior management roles has improved from 59:41 to 75:25 over the past three years.\n\nOur strong employer brand enabled us to attract high-quality talent for three new businesses built grounds-up: Birla Opus, Birla Pivot and Novel Jewels. We hired 14,800+ employees across levels in the management cadre, 75% of whom are millennials and Gen Z.\n\nWe have maintained our focus on strengthening gender diversity, ensuring more women are in mainstream roles and leading strategic responsibilities across various functions and regions. Currently, women make up 15.6% of our management cadre, with 277 women holding senior and top leadership positions. We are also making a special e/ffort to increase the representation of women in technical roles. For example, we have appointed our /uniFB01rst female unit head for the battery enclosure\n\nplant, enrolled 25 women in a one-year apprenticeship programme in core mining who will be placed in UltraTech, and have women serving as Territory Sales Managers at Birla Opus.\n\nWe strive to enrich the lives of our employees through integrated healthcare solutions that focus on their physical and emotional well-being, as well as that of their families. Our Digital Health and Well-being app, AB Multiply, has enrolled 26,000 employees for holistic wellness services. Additionally, over 9,000 employees have bene/uniFB01ted from company-sponsored annual physical health checkups. We have made signi/uniFB01cant e/fforts to reduce the stigma associated with mental health, ensuring that employees and their families can access professional and con/uniFB01dential counselling services when needed. Last year, over 1,000 employees or their family members sought help, marking an increase of more than 25%.\n\nThe results of ABG Vibes 2023, our annual engagement survey, re/uniFB02ect our commitment to being a force for good for our employees. The scores have improved in all areas across employee segments compared to the previous cycle: 91% of employees are proud to be associated with the Group, 93% would recommend the Group as a great place to work, and 87% see themselves working with the Group two years from now (an 8% increase from the last cycle). Additionally, 89% of employees /uniFB01nd a sense of meaning and purpose in their work, and 91% are optimistic about the future of the business.\n\nIndeed, the Aditya Birla Group stands at an exciting juncture. Many of our businesses are poised for transformational growth,  while new ventures are emerging with a lot of promise. We are not just expanding in size but also diversifying in scope across various industries and regions.\n\n## Your Company's Performance\n\nIn FY24 your Company recorded net sales of USD 8.4 billion ( I 69,810 crores) and EBITDA of USD 1.6 billion ( I 13,586 crores).\n\nYour Company has embarked on a capacity expansion drive on a scale that is globally unprecedented in the cement sector. As a result of the ongoing projects, your Company has recently reached a historic milestone of 150+ MTPA capacity. This capacity surpasses 150% of the capacity in the United States and constitutes 80% of Europe's capacity.\n\nFrom the /uniFB01rst cement unit that we commissioned in the early 1980s with one MTPA capacity to now the World's third largest cement company, outside of China, UltraTech's journey has been marked by scorching growth, ambitious bets and /uniFB02awless execution.\n\nIn FY24, your Company expanded its cement production capacity by 13.81 MTPA and in FY25 up to June 2024, UltraTech has added 8.7 MTPA capacity across several locations. Of this total, 20.87 MTPA capacity was added through green/uniFB01eld and brown/uniFB01eld expansions alone. Currently, capacity expansion projects are underway in 16 locations across India which will add another 34 MTPA. Additionally, your Company is in the process of closing the proposed acquisition of Kesoram Cement. Together, these e/fforts place your Company within striking distance of the 200 MTPA capacity target announced at last year's Annual General Meeting.\n\nIndia's infrastructure sector is poised for remarkable growth, with an estimated 15.3 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in investments, projected over the next /uniFB01ve years. This growth is expected to result in a cumulative expenditure of USD 1.45 trillion, as per Morgan Stanley. The rapid expansion\n\nof production capacity, coupled with the signi/uniFB01cant strengthening of brand equity in the marketplace, positions your Company to harness these longterm growth opportunities e/ffectively.\n\nUltraTech's growth trajectory mirrors India's growth story. It is heartening that our growth momentum has accelerated, enabling us to be at the forefront of India's infrastructure development. With a mix of integrated cement plants, grinding units, and bulk terminals across 59 locations in India, along with 300+ ready mix concrete plants, UltraTech's scale and capacity footprint is unparalleled. And this scale will further enable your Company to service India's growing demand for cement across the country. UltraTech, as a national champion, is a key enabler of India's development.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nAs a leading global cement company, UltraTech is one of the leaders in setting the sustainability agenda for the sector. As a founding member of the Global Cement and Concrete Association, your Company plays a pivotal role in catalysing multi-stakeholder collaborations in the ecosystem.\n\nAt the heart of our sustainability agenda is our commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050. Your Company has put in place a clear roadmap to realising this ambitious goal. We focus on achieving key milestones across our sustainability areas: Decarbonisation, Energy Transition, Circular Economy, Biodiversity, and Water Management. Signi/uniFB01cant progress has been made in these areas, particularly in energy transition. Your Company achieved its EP100 commitment ahead of the 2035 target year, doubling its energy productivity from the base year of 2010. This exempli/uniFB01es our commitment to operational e/fficiency and reducing environmental impact.\n\nAs part of its RE100 commitment, your Company has signi/uniFB01cantly increased its renewable energy capacity by 77% and WHRS capacity by 32% in FY24 compared to FY23. Your Company now boasts 890 MW of Green Energy, including 612 MW of renewable energy and 278 MW of WHRS capacity. This has helped achieve 22% electricity substitution by green power in FY24. With planned increases in renewable energy and WHRS capacity, your Company will soon reach an astounding 1000 MW of Green Energy. UltraTech aims to increase the overall share of green energy in its total energy mix to 85% by 2030.\n\nOur tremendous progress in key sustainability areas has earned us national and international recognition. The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), a global non-pro/uniFB01t organisation, awarded your Company a 'B' score for 'Climate Action' and an 'A-' rating for 'Water Security' in their latest 2023 rating. Your Company has also been ranked among the top ten companies globally in the sector by S&P Global's CSA 2023. UltraTech is the only cement company from India to feature in the global top sectoral list.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYour Company's multidimensional achievements underscore what has been a foundational philosophy of our group-that true corporate success is measured by the enduring value we create for all our stakeholders. And that is our legacy, our promise, and our future.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla Chairman",

As India continues on its path towards becoming a global economic powerhouse, the government has remained steadfast in its focus on strengthening infrastructure and connectivity across the country.\n\nThe government's commitment is evident through its allocation of 3.3% of GDP to the infrastructure sector in the /uniFB01scal year 2024, with a particular focus on the transport and logistics segments. The interim budget allocation announced for 2024/25 recently signals India's ambitions to further scale-up infrastructure.\n\nThe continued focus on infrastructure development provides a signi/uniFB01cant opportunity for our sector. As India's leading cement and ready-mix concrete company, your Company is well placed to leverage this high growth opportunity and partner the nation in its development journey.\n\nOver the years your Company has been the preferred supplier of cement, concrete and building products to many iconic projects like the New Parliament Building, Delhi's Signature Bridge, Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, Bandra Worli Sea Link among several others including all the metro rail projects in the country. Your Company is the largest cement, ready-mix-concrete, and specialised building products supplier to yet another iconic project - the recently inaugurated Mumbai Coastal Road Project, boasting of India's /uniFB01rst undersea tunnel.\n\nIt has always been your Company's endeavour to provide value to all stakeholders. Our capacity expansion projects have boosted our ability to serve our customers across the remotest parts of the country, thanks to enhanced reach and improved e/fficiencies at scale. We exited FY24 with a consolidated grey cement production capacity of 147.3 MTPA, adding 13.4 MTPA capacity through green/uniFB01eld and brown/uniFB01eld capacity expansion projects alone. More recently in April 2024, we celebrated a landmark milestone of crossing 150+ MTPA\n\ncement capacity. It is indeed a matter of pride that your Company achieved this landmark within 5 years of achieving the 100 MTPA cement capacity in 2019.\n\nYour Company's performance during the year was commendable. We registered a turnover of I 69,810 crores with consolidated sales volume of 13% and a healthy 22% increase in EBITDA to I 13,586 crores. Despite signi/uniFB01cant capital expenditure of around I 9,000 crores, we have been able to generate robust cash /uniFB02ows. With a net debt EBITDA of 0.2x, your Company has demonstrated strong /uniFB01nancial resilience.\n\nYour Company's e/fforts to deliver sustained economic value is underlined by its e/fforts to increase is positive social impact and reduce its environmental footprint. Sustainability is a foundational principle for us and a key factor in our business decision making process. As a leading global cement player, we are committed to driving the sustainability agenda for the sector.\n\nYour Company is committed to realising its Net Zero goal by 2050. During FY24, we have made signi/uniFB01cant progress across key focus areas of sustainability, viz. decarbonisation, energy transition, circular economy, biodiversity management, water conservation, safe operations and community development.\n\nYour Company has achieved its EP100 commitment by successfully doubling energy productivity from the base year of 2010. As part of its RE100 commitment, UltraTech has signi/uniFB01cantly increased its renewable energy capacity by 77% and WHRS capacity by 32% from FY23. The current capacity as of FY24 stands at 612 MW of RE and 278 MW of WHRS. This has achieved 22% electricity substitution by green power mix in FY24.\n\nDuring the year, your Company announced that it will not be making any further investments in thermal power capacity thus boosting its e/fforts to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nYour Company has been focused on reducing its carbon footprint across the value chain of its operations. We have taken signi/uniFB01cant strides in enabling sustainable transport in its logistics operations. Your Company is among the /uniFB01rst cement companies in India to promote 'Green Logistics' by introducing CNG vehicles and LNG vehicles in its operations in 2021 and 2022 respectively.  Through concerted e/fforts with logistic partners, your Company currently has more than 420 CNG trucks and over 60 LNG trucks deployed in its logistics operations. During the year, we piloted the use of electric trucks in our operations. We deployed /uniFB01ve EV trucks for transport of clinker from our integrated cement manufacturing unit Dhar Cement located in Madhya Pradesh, to our grinding unit Dhule Cement located in Maharashtra. This pilot has been very successful and has helped to not only reduce carbon emissions but also reduced costs through improved turnaround times helping to service the market better. It is your Company's stated intent to scale up the use of electric trucks in its operations.\n\nWater security is another key focus area for your Company. This is particularly important given the growing stress on water resources across the country. In FY24, we achieved 100+ million cubic meters of water conservation, becoming 5 times water positive in line with our stated commitment. Your Company's water management e/fforts encompass areas within the unit premises as well as beyond the fence, i.e. within the communities it operates in.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n13 %\n\nIncrease in consolidated sales volume YoY\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n22 %\n\nIncrease in EBITDA YoY\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAs we re/uniFB02ect on the year gone by, we need to prepare for the way ahead. In the coming decade, the cement sector will witness intensi/uniFB01ed competition with key players pursuing aggressive growth.\n\nYour Company will continue its focus on uncovering and discovering new value with deployment of digital technologies, strengthen its cost leadership by continuously enhancing its operational e/fficiency and will continue to push the envelope in driving sustainability in its operations.\n\nYour Company will continue to drive market development initiatives focused on strengthening its brand equity as it supports the nation in its ambitious infrastructure projects. As a true national champion, your Company will continue to play a pivotal role in partnering the nation in ful/uniFB01lling its ambitions.\n\nK. C. Jhanwar\n\nManaging Director",

In 2023-24, we fundamentally redesigned our Materiality Assessment with the assistance of a third party. We adopted the Double Materiality assessment process in accordance with international standards, ensuring close alignment with our Risk Assessment procedures. We also broadened our stakeholder engagement to capture their insights, which help us align our strategic initiatives more e/ffectively to maximise impact on our stakeholders.\n\nUltraTech's Double Materiality Assessment was conducted following the guidelines set by key standard-setting bodies, including the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Integrated Reporting (IR), and the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).\n\nIn 2023-24, we recognised higher value in implementing the Double Materiality assessment compared to the previous single materiality approach. This process has enabled us to gain external and diverse perspectives on the key risks and opportunities facing our business. We considered the following perspectives:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Work scope and methodology\n\n## UNDERSTANDING\n\nUnderstand related activities in the business value chain\n\n- \u00b7  Understanding operations: Refreshing the understanding of UltraTech's operations, business model, and data landscape\n- \u00b7  Value chain mapping: Map out value chains and determine value chain boundary\n- \u00b7  Identify relevant matters: Identify relevant topics, subtopics, and/or subsubtopics that are considered relevant for further assessment\n- \u00b7  Stakeholder identi/uniFB01cation: Identify stakeholders and advisors and plan their role in the assessment process\n\n## IDENTIFICATION\n\nIdentifying impacts, risks, and opportunities (IROs)\n\n- \u00b7  Research and analysis: Identify IROs for relevant topics through research, prior assessments, peer screening, industry standards, news screening, and more\n- \u00b7  'Outside-In' pathways: Identify potentially /uniFB01nancially material risks and opportunities for UltraTech\n- \u00b7  'Inside-Out' pathways: Identify potential impacts on stakeholders\n- \u00b7  Stakeholder engagement: Contribute in identifying or validating IROs for assessment\n\n## ASSESSMENT\n\nAssessment of materiality\n\n- \u00b7  De/uniFB01ne materiality threshold: De/uniFB01ne threshold for determining materiality\n- \u00b7  Financial impact assessment: Assess size and likelihood of the risks and opportunities\n- \u00b7  Impact assessment: Assess scale, scope, irremediability, and likelihood of the impact\n- \u00b7  Stakeholder engagement: Contribute to or con/uniFB01rm the scoring for impact and /uniFB01nancial assessments\n\n## DETERMINATION\n\nPrioritising material impacts, risks and opportunities\n\n- \u00b7  Determine material IROs: Identify IROs that exceed the threshold and are material\n- \u00b7  Rank top material matters: To rank material company-speci/uniFB01c topics in order to understand their impact and identify topic-wise Disclosure Requirements\n- \u00b7  Identify material information for disclosure: To identify information material to disclose for each material matter\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Outcome\n\nIdenti/uniFB01cation of impacts, risks and opportunities from UltraTech's services and value chain.

This engagement, through our business relationships, encompasses both the upstream and downstream aspects of the value chain, as well as the broader sustainability context. This process aids in identifying and assessing the impacts, risks, and opportunities related to our activities.\n\nAccording to the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), a reporting entity must identify 'Stakeholders as those who can a/ffect or be a/ffected by the undertaking.'

FY 2023-24 saw India grow by ~9%. The next two decades present a remarkable opportunity for the country to usher in a new global era. With a focus on world-class infrastructure, investment-oriented policies, and reforms, India is well on its way to becoming a manufacturing and technology hub.\n\nAs India makes progress, the cement industry is poised to grow along with it. It has an essential role in building the India of tomorrow, contributing to the construction of not just our homes, schools, and hospitals, but also our roads, bridges, railways, and beyond.\n\n## QUANTIFYING INDIA'S DEVELOPMENT JOURNEY\n\n## Economic growth\n\nIndia will become the third economic superpower by 2037 and a $10-trillion economy by 2035 , according to CEBR\n\n## Demographic dividend\n\n~68% of India's population belongs to the 15-64 years category, and 26% in the 10-24 years group, making India one of the youngest countries in the world.\n\n## Better living standards\n\nIndia's a/ffluent population is expected to increase from 60 million in 2023 to 100 million people by 2027.\n\n## Digital India\n\nExpected digital penetration of 95% by 2025.\n\n## Industrial/Commercial\n\n- \u00b7  Implementation of the PLI scheme to increase the manufacturing sector's share of GDP.\n- \u00b7  Highest-ever warehousing transactions recorded across Tier 1 and 2 cities in India.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## High-performing and resilient\n\nConcrete protects our homes, cities, and infrastructure like no other material, resisting disasters - from /uniFB01res and /uniFB02oods to earthquakes.\n\n## Key factors driving opportunities\n\n## Housing\n\n- \u00b7  Higher urbanisation (37% by FY 2029-30 from 35.4% in FY 2023-24) and nuclearisation (FY 2023-24: 4.0 to 3.7 by FY 2029-30) leading to an upswing in real estate.\n- \u00b7  Refocus on low-cost housing (3 cr new houses in next 5-7 years), to provide continued support for a/ffordable housing, with a particular focus on rural areas.\n- \u00b7  The real estate sector is expected to see more than a 2x increase to become a $1 trillion+ industry by 2030.\n\n## The future of construction\n\nThe cities of the future must prioritise sustainability, considering that the construction sector currently contributes to 38% of the world's CO 2 emissions. Of this, 30% is generated during the construction phase, while 70% is associated with buildings in use.\n\nAt UltraTech, sustainability is at the core of our strategic priorities. We are committed to the GCCA 2050 Cement and Concrete Industry Roadmap for Net Zero Concrete. This is aligned with the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C outlined in the Paris Agreement.\n\n## Concrete: the material for a Net Zero future\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Sustainable\n\nConcrete is local, a/ffordable, and recyclable.

This is on account of greater-than-expected resilience in the United States and several large emerging markets and developing economies, as well as /uniFB01scal support in China. While in/uniFB02ation is projected to decline steadily, tighter monetary policies and lingering geopolitical issues are tempering growth prospects.\n\nThe global growth forecast for 2024-25 is below the historical 2000-19 average of 3.8%, with elevated central bank policy rates to /uniFB01ght in/uniFB02ation, a withdrawal of /uniFB01scal support amid high debt weighing on economic activity, and low underlying productivity growth. In/uniFB02ation is falling faster than expected in most regions, amid unwinding supply-side issues and restrictive monetary policy.\n\nWith disin/uniFB02ation and steady growth, the likelihood of a hard landing has receded, and risks to global growth are broadly balanced. On the upside, faster disin/uniFB02ation could lead to further easing of the /uniFB01nancial conditions. On the downside, new commodity price spikes from geopolitical shocks including continued attacks in the Red Sea and supply disruptions or more persistent underlying in/uniFB02ation, could prolong the tight monetary conditions.\n\nThe Indian economy demonstrates resilience and maintains healthy macroeconomic fundamentals, despite uncertainty from adverse geopolitical developments. Strong domestic demand for consumption and investment, along with the Government's continued emphasis on capital expenditure are seen as among the key drivers of GDP. Additionally, a growing domestic services sector will contribute signi/uniFB01cantly. India has registered the highest growth among major advanced and emerging market economies during this period. As per the IMF, India is likely to become the third largest economy in 2027. It also estimates that India's contribution to global growth will rise by 200 bps in /uniFB01ve years.",

        "page_content": "The substantial tripling of capital expenditure over the past four years has signi/uniFB01cantly ampli/uniFB01ed India's economic growth and job creation. As a result, there has been an 11.1% increase in the capital expenditure outlay for the next year, amounting to ' 11,11,111 crores. This /uniFB01gure represents 3.4% of the GDP.\n\nMacroeconomic stability and improvement in India's external position, particularly the signi/uniFB01cant moderation in the current account de/uniFB01cit and the resurgence of capital /uniFB02ows, were bolstered by a robust foreign exchange reserves bu/ffer. This contributed to the stability of the Indian Rupee during FY 2023-24. Additionally, in/uniFB02ationary pressures in India were mitigated, largely due to proactive supply-side initiatives by the Government.\n\nThe Government's /uniFB01scal policy has aimed at bolstering the domestic economy's resilience against external shocks while safeguarding macroeconomic stability. There has been a concerted focus on the integrated and coordinated planning and implementation of infrastructure projects, adhering to the principles of PM Gati Shakti. Priority has been given to allocating expenditure towards vital sectors such as drinking water, housing, sanitation, green energy, health, education, agriculture, and rural development to foster sustainable and inclusive advancement. Additionally, the e/ffectiveness of cash management has been enhanced through the timely release of resources using the Single Nodal Agency/Treasury Single Account system.\n\nResponding to the increasing demand from the infrastructure and housing sectors, the Indian cement industry is poised to add new production capacities. As much as 35 - 40 million tonnes capacity is expected to be commissioned in the next /uniFB01scal, with 60 - 65% concentrated in the eastern and southern regions.\n\nIn FY 2024-25, cement demand is projected to grow by ~7-8% driven by an increase in construction activities throughout the country, spread across the infrastructure and housing sector. This is indicating a steady increase in the cement industry's capacity utilisation from around 68% in FY23 to around 72% in FY25.\n\nIt is against this backdrop, that we share your Company's performance during FY 2023-24.\n\n## Business Performance\n\n## Production and Capacity Utilisation (Grey Cement)\n\n| Particulars                         | FY 2023-24   | FY 2022-23   | % change   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|------------|\n| Installed capacity in  India (MTPA) | 140.76       | 126.95       | 11         |\n| Production (MMT)                    | 111.63       | 99.43        | 12         |\n| Capacity Utilisation                | 85%          | 84%          | 1%         |\n\nMTPA - Million Metric Tonnes Per Annum; MMT - Million Metric Tonnes\n\nCement production in FY 2023-24 was higher by 12% at 111.63 million tonnes as compared to FY 2022-23, while capacity utilisation was at 85% as compared to 84%.\n\n## Sales Volume\n\n| Particulars            |   FY 2023-24 |   FY 2022-23 |   (Figures in MMT) % change |\n|------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| Grey Cement - India    |       112.81 |       100.06 |                          13 |\n| Grey Cement - Overseas |         4.93 |         4.42 |                          11 |\n| White Cement           |         1.84 |         1.63 |                          13 |\n| Total Sales Volume*    |       119.04 |       105.71 |                          13 |\n\n* After elimination of inter Company sales.\n\nDomestic sales volume registered a growth of 13% in FY 2023-24.

Debtors  Turnover (Days) is used to quantify a company's e/ffectiveness in collecting its receivables or money owed by customers. The ratio shows how well a company uses and manages the credit it extends to customers. The ratio is calculated by dividing average trade receivables by average turnover per day.\n- II. Inventory  Turnover (Days) represents the average number of days a company holds its inventory before selling it. It is calculated by dividing average inventory by average turnover per day.\n- III. Interest Coverage Ratio measures how many times a company can cover its current interest payment with its available earnings. It is calculated by dividing PBIT by /uniFB01nance cost.\n- IV. Current  Ratio is a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations or those due within one year. It is calculated by dividing the current assets by current liabilities (excluding current borrowings).\n- V. Debt Equity Ratio is used to evaluate a company's /uniFB01nancial leverage. It is a measure of the degree to which a company is /uniFB01nancing its operations through debt versus owned funds. It is calculated by dividing a company's total liabilities by its shareholder's equity. Your Company's Debt Equity Ratio (Net) has improved by 56% in FY 2023-24, primarily on account of reduction in debt and increase in net worth during the year.\n\nVI.\n\n- Operating Pro/uniFB01t Margin (%) is a pro/uniFB01tability or performance ratio used to calculate the percentage of pro/uniFB01t a company generates from its operations. It is calculated by dividing the PBIDT (excluding Other Income) by turnover.\n- VII.   Net Pro/uniFB01t Margin (%) is the net income or pro/uniFB01t a company generates as a percentage of its revenue. It is calculated by dividing the pro/uniFB01t for the year by the turnover. Your Company's Net Pro/uniFB01t Margin increased by 25% mainly on account of lower energy costs and higher volume, partly set o/ff by higher interest outgo and lower realisations during the year.\n- VIII.  Return on Net Worth ('RONW') is a measure of pro/uniFB01tability of a company expressed as a percentage. It is calculated by dividing Net Pro/uniFB01t from continuing operations for the year by average Net Worth during the year. Your Company's RONW increased by 28% mainly on account of increase in Net Pro/uniFB01t during the year.\n- IX. Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) (%) measures a company's pro/uniFB01tability and the e/fficiency with which its capital is used. In other words, the ratio measures how well a company is generating pro/uniFB01ts from its capital. It is calculated by dividing pro/uniFB01t before interest, exceptional items, and tax, by average capital employed during the year.\n- X. Earnings Per Share [EPS] is the portion of a company's pro/uniFB01t allocated to each share. It serves as an indicator of a company's pro/uniFB01tability. It is calculated by dividing pro/uniFB01t for the year by weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.

        "page_content": "## ANNEXURE VII\n\nUltraTech Cement Limited ('the Company') an Aditya Birla Group Company adopts/shall adopt this Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy as applicable across Group Companies. This philosophy/policy is detailed below.\n\n## Aditya Birla Group: Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy\n\nAt the Aditya Birla Group, we expect our executive team to foster a culture of growth and entrepreneurial risk-taking. Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards including incentive programs, retirement bene/uniFB01t programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the longterm success of our stakeholders.\n\n## Our business and organisational model\n\nOur Group is a conglomerate and organised in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences.\n\n## I. Objectives of the Executive Remuneration Program\n\nOur executive remuneration program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders.\n\nOur executive remuneration program is intended to:\n\n- 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis.\n- 2. Emphasise 'Pay for Performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals.\n\n## II. Executives\n\n## Our Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy applies to the following:\n\n- 1. Directors of the Company.\n- 2. Key Managerial Personnel: Chief Executive O/fficer and equivalent; Chief Financial O/fficer and Company Secretary.\n- 3. Senior Management: as may be decided by the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Other Remuneration Elements\n\nEach of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives including continuity of service across the Group Companies.\n\nWe limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and generally do not provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives.\n\n## Risk and Compliance\n\nWe aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as, remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives, uncapped pay- outs, unreasonable goals or thresholds, steep pay-out cli/ffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds.\n\n## Claw back Clause\n\nIn an incident of restatement of /uniFB01nancial statements, due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act, 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives, the remuneration received in excess, of what would be payable to him/her as per restatement of /uniFB01nancial statements, pertaining to the relevant performance year.\n\n## Implementation\n\nThe Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination, Remuneration and Compensation Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy/Policy. These services will be established through 'arm's length', agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.\n\n## III. Business and Talent Competitors\n\nWe benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are broadly equitable and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. Secondary reference points bring to the table, the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, to appreciate the di/fferences in levels and medium of pay and build in as appropriate for decision making.\n\n## IV.   Executive Pay Positioning\n\nWe aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and bene/uniFB01ts, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognise the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning our executives.\n\nWe use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should re/uniFB02ect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\n## V. Executive Pay-Mix\n\nOur executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Bene/uniFB01ts.\n\n## Annual Incentive Plan:\n\nWe tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant /uniFB01nancial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the /uniFB01nancial and operational metrics with priorities/focus areas for the business.\n\n## Long-Term Incentive:\n\nOur Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as a retention and reward tool.\n\nWe use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicles for our executives as we believe that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests.\n\nWe grant performance stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain our executives.\n\n## VI.   Performance Goal Setting\n\nWe aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic.\n\nThreshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall re/uniFB02ect a base-line level of performance, re/uniFB02ecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement.\n\nTarget performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance.\n\nMaximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, re/uniFB02ecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.\n\n## VII.   Executive Bene/uniFB01ts and Perquisites\n\nOur executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other  employee bene/uniFB01t plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for perquisites and bene/uniFB01ts plans commensurate with their roles. These bene/uniFB01ts are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group.",

        "page_content": "## Remuneration of Directors and Others:\n\nYour Company's executive remuneration philosophy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards including incentive programs, retirement bene/uniFB01t programs, promotion and advancement opportunities, with the long-term success of your Company's stakeholders. The executive remuneration policy is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who contribute to your Company's long-term success and thereby build value for stakeholders. It is intended to provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements on a holistic basis; emphasise 'pay for performance' by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed business and individual goals.\n\nExecutive pay practices and levels are dynamically tracked and aligned with peer companies in similar industries, geographies, size and function. Your Company aims to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to its executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and bene/uniFB01ts, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive payouts at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. It recognises the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience of incumbents while positioning its executives. Your Company uses secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should re/uniFB02ect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector.\n\nThe remuneration involves a balance between /uniFB01xed and incentive pay, re/uniFB02ecting short and long-term performance objectives appropriate to the working of your Company and its goals. A material proportion of compensation for senior management is performance based - 25% to 40% of compensation. It increases as the employee grows in the organisation and takes up roles of higher responsibility. The more senior the role, the weightage of business performance on the variable pay also increases in comparison to unit performance and individual performance. This ensures a competitive pay-mix which aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Bene/uniFB01ts.\n\nAnnual incentive plan pay-outs of executives is linked to relevant /uniFB01nancial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. Financial and operational metrics are annually aligned with priorities / focus areas for the business. Long-term incentive plans incentivise stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as a retention and reward tool. Stock options are used as the primary long-term incentive vehicles as your Company believes that they best align executive incentives with stakeholder interests. Your Company also grants restricted stock units as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain its executives. The ratio of stock options and performance stock units is generally 75:25.\n\nYour Company has integrated climate change and sustainability targets in the key responsibility areas ('KRAs') of the executive directors and senior management. Thus, emission reduction targets and other improvement targets related to climate change are also linked with the incentives provided.\n\n## Non-Executive Directors' Remuneration\n\nBased on the recommendation of the NRC Committee, all decisions relating to remuneration of Directors are taken by your Company's Board in accordance with the shareholder's approval, wherever necessary.\n\nSitting fees are paid as under: -\n\n- \u00b7 Board: ' 50,000 per meeting.\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee: ' 25,000 per meeting.\n- \u00b7 Other Committees: ' 20,000 per meeting.\n\nIn addition to the sitting fees, your Company also pays commission to the Non-Executive Independent Directors of an amount not exceeding 1% per annum of the net pro/uniFB01t of your Company. The amount of commission payable is determined after assigning weightage to various factors, which, inter alia, include providing strategic perspective, Chairmanship and contributions made by the Directors, type of meeting and responsibilities under various statutes, performance evaluation, etc. Based on the performance evaluation of each Director and the remuneration policy, the Board has recommended an amount of ' 14 crores as commission to be paid to the Non-Executive Directors for the /uniFB01nancial year 2023-24.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe details of remuneration paid / to be paid to each of the Directors are given below: -\n\n|                       | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid   | Sitting fees paid                    | ( H  in lakhs)       |\n|-----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| Name of Director      | Board               | Audit  Committee    | SRC  Committee      | NRC  Committee      | RMS  Committee      | CSR  Committee      | Finance  Committee  | Committee of  Independent  Directors | Commission*  payable |\n| Kumar Mangalam  Birla | 3.50                | -                   | -                   | 0.80                | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                                    | -                    |\n| Mrs. Rajashree Birla  | 2.50                | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | 0.20                | -                   | -                                    | 670.00               |\n| Arun Adhikari         | 3.50                | 1.50                | -                   | 0.80                | -                   | -                   | -                   | 0.20                                 | 164.00               |\n| Mrs. Alka Bharucha    | 2.00                | 1.00                | -                   | 0.40                | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                                    | 130.00               |\n| Sunil Duggal          | 3.50                | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | -                   | 0.20                                 | 88.00                |\n| Mrs. Sukanya  Kripalu | 3.50                | -                   | 0.80                | -                   | 0.40                | 0.20                | -                   | 0.20                                 | 124.00               |\n| S.

This is in addition to the existing system viz. SCORES, where investors initially lodge their complaints / grievances against the Company.\n\nThe SMART ODR Portal is an approach to help investors access e/fficient dispute resolution online. In case the investor is not satis/uniFB01ed with the resolution provided by the Company / RTA / SCORES then the Online Dispute Resolution process may be initiated through the ODR Portal at https://smartodr.in/login.\n\nThe link to the ODR Portal is also displayed on the Company's website: https://www.ultratechcement.com/.\n\n## Intimate / update contact details\n\nShareholders are requested to intimate / update changes, if any, pertaining to their PAN, postal address, e-mail address, telephone / mobile numbers, with necessary documentary evidence, to the Company or its RTA, in Form ISR-1, if shares are held in physical mode or to their DP, if the holding is in demat mode.

        "page_content": "## Social Report\n\n## Towards enriching lives: A brief narrative on our CSR engagement\n\n'There is a lot to distinguish us from the rest of the world. Over the last decade and a half, India, the world's largest democracy, has been on an epic journey of growth and evolution. The heartening reforms agenda /uniFB02agged o/ff over the last couple of decades, has turned the tide with the upliftment of over 400 million people from the mire of poverty.\n\nPublic infrastructure is gaining momentum. The digital revolution is undeniably enhancing productivity and stoking employment. India stands at the cusp of becoming the next great economic power. As it is, we are the world's fastest growing economy, at an estimated rate of 7.5%, which is truly amasing. GDP grew at a whopping 8.6% in the year to the 4 th quarter of 2023. In a NASSCOM study as well as in the TOI edit (Swaminomics) on the rise of Global Capabilities Centres (GCC) setup in India by multinationals for their multiple R&D and other services, they have mentioned that in 2023, 1,580 centres were engaged in pursuit of their business. Today, the GCCs employ more 3.2 million Indians.\n\nWe are the only country world over to record an estimated 2.3 million STEM graduates. Truly a terri/uniFB01c resource.\n\nFurthermore, India is amongst the youngest countries in terms of our youth force. The median age of 28.2 implies that half the population is below this age. India's population bulge is sharpest in the 15 to 24 age group.\n\nThe magnitude of India's demographic dividend is sizeable enough to sustain economic growth of 8% over the next two to three decades. This tantalising growth potential arises from the interplay of several forces that are playing out along with the demographic dividend. But there are anxieties as well. The foremost concern that haunts us is the specter of rising unemployment.\n\nThe India Skills Report states that only 52.3% of recent graduates are employable. This underscores the need to retune our education systems, so that they result in meeting market or industry needs. The New Education Policy has taken a step but still has a long way to go. Even though a macro level issue, we believe corporates can play a vital role.\n\nConcerted e/fforts are required not only leaning on the government, but captains of industry, academicians, champions of innovation, among others, to enhance the relevance and e/ffectiveness of education per se and skill training institutes.\n\nTo address anxieties, in our CSR endeavours, besides our focus on health, education, and infrastructure, our gaze is /uniFB01xed on getting a secure life for the underprivileged through the right kind of training, right kind of learning and development, more so of skill development, so that going forward they have a market value.\n\nAt the ground level, we have embarked on training over 3 Lakhs farmers in scienti/uniFB01c agro /uniFB01eld management practices and crop cultivation. We have helped formation of 6,000 women Self Help Groups ('SHGs'). Our playbook also encompasses skills training centres attuning them to the market requirement.\n\nWhat is important is that of ensuring circularity, entailing that all that they produced is willingly accepted by the customers and they have an assured level of income.

Health and safety management system:\n\n- a. Whether an occupational health and safety management system has been implemented by the entity? (Yes/ No). If yes, the coverage of such system?\n- -Yes. 95% of the Company's Units are ISO 45001 certi/uniFB01ed for implemented occupational health and safety management systems covering all elements of Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.",

    },
    {
        "page_content": "- b. What are the processes used to identify work-related hazards and assess risks on a  routine and non-routine basis by the entity?\n\nThe Company conducts detailed hazard identi/uniFB01cation and risk assessment (HIRA). Risk score of routine as well as non-routine activity is calculated by multiplying assigned scores of exposure (E), Severity (S) and Probability (P). If the risk score is higher than tolerable limit considering existing control measures, additional control measures are applied based on hierarchy of control (elimination, substitution, engineering control, administrative control, and PPE in descending order). The aim is to ensure the reduction of all work-related risks to ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable). In addition to this, Company uses other tools like HAZOP, Bow-Tie etc. to conduct critical process-safety related hazard identi/uniFB01cation and risk assessment.\n\n- c. Whether you have processes for workers to report the work-related hazards and to remove themselves from such risks. (Y/N)\n- Yes. Workers are encouraged to report work-related hazards and unsafe conditions, if any, at various forums. They are also included in teams for conducting Hazard Identi/uniFB01cation & Risk Assessment and their inputs are considered while applying risk control measures.\n\nMoreover, with an aim to reach out to every person and make them aware that they can act as whistle blowers to save lives, an exclusive safety toll free number has been made available 24x7. This has acted as an e/ffective deterrent against engaging in high-risk activities without taking requisite safety precautions.

Provide the processes for consultation between stakeholders and the Board on economic, environmental, and social topics or if consultation is delegated, how is feedback from such consultations provided to the Board.\n\nThe Company's Mission - To deliver superior value to our stakeholders on the four pillars of:\n\nSustainability | Innovation | Team Empowerment | Customer Centricity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a step in this direction, the Company engages with stakeholders as on ongoing process - be it investors; lenders; analysts; shareholders; employees; customers; suppliers and other channel partners.\n\nThis enables the Company to feel the pulse of stakeholders, their expectations, and aspirations. Feedback received during interactions with stakeholders are deliberated by the management team and implemented, where appropriate.\n\nThe Board and relevant Committees are briefed about the interactions with the stakeholders and action implemented.\n\n- 2. Whether stakeholder consultation is used to support the identi/uniFB01cation and management of environmental, and social topics (Yes / No). If so, provide details of instances as to how the inputs received from stakeholders on these topics were incorporated into policies and activities of the entity.\n\nStakeholders form an integral part of the Company's business. Consultations are in the form of investor meetings; employee engagement; vendor / dealer meets; inter-action with host communities; training programs, among others.\n\nThe Company is committed to driving sustainability. It is focusing on reducing the carbon emissions by several ways. The decarbonisation framework includes driving e/fficiency improvements, introducing new technologies for reducing carbon footprint, using alternative energy, recovering waste heat, increasing renewables in the energy mix, introducing green product continuously in the portfolio, adopting circularity, reducing water usage, and improving biodiversity. It also has e/ffective community management and human rights management.\n\nThe Company benchmarks its sustainability practices with global players through Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA). As the founding member of the GCCA, the Company has played a pivotal role in launching GCCA's India operations and exploring the new technology adoption possibilities.\n\nThe Company undertakes its social initiatives under the aegis of The Aditya Birla Centre for Community Initiatives and Rural Development, under the able leadership of Mrs. Rajashree Birla. The key focus areas are education, healthcare, women-empowerment, sustainable livelihood, infrastructure, and social reform.\n\nIt follows a bottom-up approach for all social projects. All projects are planned in consultation with the community. The process involves interacting with them and understanding their challenges and issues. We interact with village panchayats and prepare a list of requirements based on in-depth focused discussions. Implementation and monitoring of a project is a mutual responsibility of the community and the team. Regular community stakeholder meetings are held to ensure appropriate implementation process is followed. Once the project achieves a status of self-sustenance, ownership is transferred to the villagers. This transfer of responsibility ensures a culture of empowerment and self-reliance.\n\n## 3.

The Company ensures that the CSR funds are utilised in an optimum manner that uplifts the weaker sections of the society.\n\nThe Company works towards overall development of the way of life of the communities around its Units, most of which are in distant rural areas and tribal belts. It reaches out to more than 1.8 million people across 500 villages spanning 16 states.\n\nIt works to actively contribute to the social and economic development of communities in which it operates.

Describe the strategy adopted by your company to reduce usage of hazardous and toxic chemicals in your products and processes and the practices adopted to manage such wastes.\n\n- -The Company encourages circularity across its operations. 98% of the waste generated by the Company (including /uniFB02y ash, STP sludge and rejected screening material) is reused in its operations and production process. The remaining 1.9% waste is recycled through authorized recyclers in an eco-friendly manner. A miniscule quantity of 2 metric tonnes of bio- medical waste (~0.0001% of total waste generated) is disposed through incineration.\n- -Hazardous waste generated by the Company constitutes only 0.05% of the total waste. Through rigorous trainings and capacity building, the Company has been able to reduce its hazardous waste generation to minimum quantity possible in industrial operations.",

Does the entity have a business continuity and disaster management plan? Give details in 100 words/ web link.\n\nThe Company has a business continuity and robust disaster management plan thoroughly implemented at each Unit. Disaster management plan, health and safety protocols and adequate communication protocols during extreme weather events ensure safety at sites and minimize the impact on workforce. Annual weather forecasts are considered to mitigate risk of delays in sourcing of fuels due to natural calamities. Insurance coverage is in place to protect against damages to business assets or loss of materials in warehouses or transit due to extreme weather events.\n\nThe Company's Units are spread across the country. If a manufacturing Unit faces business disruption or shutdown due to extreme weather events, alternative Units in other locations can serve the respective customer. Widespread logistics network with warehouses across di/fferent parts of the country enable /uniFB02exibility in the Company's operations and ensure business continuity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## 6. Disclose any signi/uniFB01cant adverse impact to the environment, arising from the value chain of the entity. What mitigation or adaptation measures have been taken by the entity in this regard?\n\nThe Company has vast integrated value chain extending from mines to packed cement bags with interconnected network of mines, suppliers, jetties, manufacturing units, railway yards, warehouses and network of dealers and retailers. Transportation, handling and storage of raw materials, fuels and other additives used in the process impact environment in negative ways. Such material tends to impact environment during cement manufacturing process too.\n\nThe Company has continuously followed circularity principles and continues to work towards it. This helps us to be more sustainable in terms of low natural resource utilisation, save on the extraction, environmental impact of transportation on GHG and air pollution. We have able to utilize 33.64 million tonnes of recycled and alternative raw materials in cement production in FY 24 along with 100% /uniFB02y ash utilisation from own power plants in cement making thus saving environment in a big way.\n\nWe are committed to reduce our GHG emissions from our process and we have made signi/uniFB01cant process as compared to base year of 2017. Our net CO 2 emission intensity has decreased from 632 kg/tonne of cementitious products (in 2017) to 556kg/tonne of cementitious products (12% reduction from base year) this year, which is in line with our target reducing 27% carbon intensity by 2032. This has been possible due large in/uniFB02ux of Renewable energy to substitute the fossil fuel-based energy and optimization of our manufacturing process.\n\nTransportation related environmental impact is a major point in our downstream operation. The Company is working to deploy electric trucks for the same which will nullify the environmental impacts in a large way.\n\nThe Company has also launched Sustainable supply chain framework and code of conduct for our suppliers in FY 24. This is aided by self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) which is monitored by third party. Based on the responses in SAQ, corrective and preventive action plan is formulated with the supplier to minimize the impact on environment and biodiversity.\n\n- 7.

We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of report of the one of the joint auditors of the Company referred to in the 'Other Matter' section below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to Note 33(b) of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, which refers to the orders dated 31 August 2016 (Penalty of ' 1,616.83 crores) and 19 January 2017 (Penalty of ' 68.30 crores) of the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which the Company (including erstwhile UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited) had /uniFB01led appeals. Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT') disallowing its appeals against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, the Company has /uniFB01led appeals before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, the Company has deposited an amount of ' 161.68 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of ' 1,616.83 crores recorded as asset. The Company, backed by legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in both the matters basis which no provision has been recognised in the books of account.\n\nOur opinion is not modi/uniFB01ed in respect of these matters.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most signi/uniFB01cance in our audit of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Revenue recognition - Discounts, incentives and rebates\n\nSee Note 1(B)(o) and Note 55 to standalone /uniFB01nancial statements\n\n| The key audit matter                                                                                                                                                                                          | How the matter was addressed in our audit                                                                                                                                                                          |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Revenue is measured net of discounts, incentives and                                                                                                                                                          | Our audit procedures included:                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| The Company's presence across di/fferent marketing  regions within the country and the competitive business  environment makes the assessment of various types of  discounts, incentives and rebates complex. | We have assessed the Company's accounting policies  relating to revenue, discounts, incentives and rebates by  comparing with applicable accounting standards.

Due to a complex regulatory environment, there is an inherent risk of litigations and claims.\n\nConsequently, provisions and contingent liability disclosures may arise from indirect tax proceedings, legal proceedings, including regulatory and other government/ department proceedings, as well as investigations by authorities and commercial claims.\n\nThe Company applies signi/uniFB01cant judgement in estimating the likelihood of the future outcome in each case and in determining the provisions or disclosures required for each matter.\n\nResolution of tax and legal proceedings may span over multiple years due to the highly complex nature and magnitude of the legal matters involved and may involve protracted negotiation or litigation.\n\nThese estimates and outcome could change signi/uniFB01cantly over time as new facts emerge and each legal case progresses.\n\nGiven the inherent complexity and magnitude of potential exposures and the judgement necessary to estimate the amount of provisions required or to determine required disclosures, this is a key audit matter.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Company's annual report, but does not include the /uniFB01nancial statements and auditor's reports thereon. The Company's annual report is expected to be made available to us after the date of this auditor's report.\n\nOur opinion on the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements does not cover the other information and we will not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identi/uniFB01ed above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nWhen we read the Company's annual report, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and describe actions applicable under the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nOur audit procedures included:\n\nWe understood the processes, evaluated the design and implementation of controls and tested the operating e/ffectiveness of the Company's controls over the recording and re-assessment of uncertain legal positions, claims (including claims receivable) and contingent liabilities.\n\nWe have gained an understanding of outstanding litigations against the Company from the Company's inhouse legal counsel and other key managerial personnel who have knowledge of these matters.\n\nWe have read the correspondence between the Company and the various indirect tax/legal authorities and the legal opinions of external legal advisors, where applicable, for signi/uniFB01cant matters.\n\nWe have challenged the Company's estimate of the possible outcome of the disputed cases based on applicable indirect tax laws and legal precedence by involving our tax specialists.\n\nWe have assessed the adequacy of the Company's disclosures in respect of contingent liabilities for indirect tax and legal matters.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Management's and Board of Directors'/Trustees' Responsibilities for the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nThe Company's Management and Board of Directors are responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these standalone /uniFB01nancial statements that give a true and fair view of the state of a/ffairs, pro/uniFB01t/ loss and other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash /uniFB02ows of the Company in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) speci/uniFB01ed under Section 133 of the Act. The respective Management and Board of Directors of the Company/Trustees of the Trust are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the assets of the Company/Trust and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls, that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors/Trustees are responsible for assessing the ability of the Company/Trust to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors/Trustees either intends to liquidate the Company/Trust or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors/Trustees are responsible for overseeing the /uniFB01nancial reporting process of the Company/ Trust.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Standalone Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/uniFB02uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of standalone /uniFB01nancial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/uniFB01cant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our",

Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /uniFB01nancial statements of the Trust of the Company to express an opinion on the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements. For the Trust included in the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, which have been audited by one of the joint auditors of the Company, such one of the joint auditors of the Company remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit carried out by them. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. Our responsibilities in this regard are further described in the section titled 'Other Matter' in this audit report.\n\nWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signi/uniFB01cant audit /uniFB01ndings, including any signi/uniFB01cant de/uniFB01ciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most signi/uniFB01cance in the audit of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest bene/uniFB01ts of such communication.\n\n## Other Matter\n\n- a. The standalone /uniFB01nancial statements includes the audited /uniFB01nancial statements of one trust whose /uniFB01nancial statements re/uniFB02ects Company's share of total assets (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs. 366.26 crores as at 31 March 2024, Company's share of total revenue (before consolidation adjustments) of Rs.

As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, we report that:\n- a.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /uniFB01nancial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /uniFB01nancial reporting and the preparation of /uniFB01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Annexure B to the Independent Auditor's Report on the standalone /uniFB01nancial statements of UltraTech Cement Limited for the year ended 31 March 2024 (Continued)\n\naccurately and fairly re/uniFB02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /uniFB01nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

The Company is engaged in the manufacture and sale of Cement and Cement related products. The Company's shares are listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), India, and the National Stock Exchange (NSE), India, Global Depository Receipts are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and Sustainability Linked Bonds are listed on the Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited.\n\n## 1 (B) Material Accounting Policies\n\n## (a) Statement of Compliance\n\nThese standalone /uniFB01nancial statements (hereinafter referred to as '/uniFB01nancial statements') are prepared in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards ('Ind AS') as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 and presentation requirements of Division II of Schedule III noti/uniFB01ed under Section 133 of Companies Act, 2013 ('the Act''), amendments thereto and other relevant provisions of the Act and guidelines issued by the Securities and Exchange Board of India ('SEBI'), as applicable.\n\nThe /uniFB01nancial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors of the Company at their meeting held on April 29, 2024.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (b) Basis of Preparation and Presentation:\n\n## Basis of Preparation\n\nThe /uniFB01nancial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the following assets and liabilities:\n\n- (i) Derivative Financial Instruments measured at fair value\n- (ii) Certain /uniFB01nancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value (refer accounting policy regarding /uniFB01nancial instruments)\n- (iii) Assets held for Sale - measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs on disposal of assets and its value in use.\n- (iv) Employee's De/uniFB01ned Bene/uniFB01t Plan as per actuarial valuation.\n- (v) Assets and liabilities acquired under Business Combination measured at fair value; and\n\n- (vi) Employee share based payments measured at fair value.\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In determining the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.\n\n## Functional and Presentation Currency\n\n- (i) The /uniFB01nancial statements are presented in Indian Rupees, which is the functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates.\n- (ii) Figures less than ' 50,000 have been shown at actual, wherever statutorily required to be disclosed, all other /uniFB01gures have been rounded o/ff in decimals to the nearest ' in lakhs, unless otherwise stated.\n\n## Classi/uniFB01cation of Assets and Liabilities into Current/Non-Current\n\nThe Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of Current / NonCurrent classi/uniFB01cation of its Assets and Liabilities.\n\nFor the purpose of Balance Sheet, an asset is classi/uniFB01ed as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be realised, or is intended to be sold or consumed, in the normal operating cycle; or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- It is expected to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- (iv) The asset is a cash or cash equivalent unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classi/uniFB01ed as non-current.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAny gain or loss on disposal of an item of PPE is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nPPE except freehold land are stated at their cost of acquisition/installation or construction net of accumulated depreciation, and impairment losses, if any. Freehold land is stated at cost less impairment losses, if any.\n\nThe Company had opted for deemed cost exemption under Ind AS 101 on transition of Ind AS.\n\n## Expenditure during construction period:\n\nExpenditure/ Income during construction period (including /uniFB01nancing cost related to borrowed funds for construction or acquisition of qualifying PPE) is included under Capital Work-in-Progress (CWIP), and the same is allocated to the respective PPE on the completion of their construction. Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other Non-Current Assets'.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (d) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with inde/uniFB01nite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Company, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Company.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Company uses di/fferent useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/uniFB01ts from those classes of assets. The estimated useful lives, residual values and the depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the e/ffect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\nSimilarly, a liability is classi/uniFB01ed as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- (ii) It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n- (iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- (iv) The Company does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not a/ffect this classi/uniFB01cation.\n\nAll other liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as noncurrent only.\n\n## (c) Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe cost of an item of PPE is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs incurred are included in the assets's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf signi/uniFB01cant parts of an item of PPE have di/fferent useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classi/uniFB01ed as PPE when they meet the de/uniFB01nition of PPE as speci/uniFB01ed in Ind AS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.",

Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the company and cost can be measured reliably, otherwise such expenditure is charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nSubsequent costs incurred are capitalized, only when it increase the future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the asset and will /uniFB02ow to the Company whose cost can be measured reliably.\n\n## \u00b7 Intangible Assets acquired separately:\n\nIntangible assets with /uniFB01nite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax / duty credits availed wherever applicable) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. The Company determines the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic bene/uniFB01ts will /uniFB02ow to the Company after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed periodically, with the e/ffect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n- \u00b7 Class of intangible assets and their estimated useful lives / basis of amortisation are as under:\n\n|   No | Nature         | Estimated Useful life / Basis of  amortization                                                                                                      |\n|------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|    1 | Jetty Rights   | Over the period of the relevant  agreement such that the  cumulative amortisation is  not less than the cumulative  rebate availed by the  Company. |\n|    2 | Mining Rights  | Over the period of the  respective mining agreement                                                                                                 |\n|    3 | Mining Reserve | On the basis of mineral  material extraction  (proportion of mineral  material extracted per annum  to total estimated mining  reserve)             |\n|    4 | Surface Rights | Over the period of the  respective mining agreement                                                                                                 |\n|    5 | Software       | 3 Years                                                                                                                                             |\n|    6 | Brand Rights   | 18 months                                                                                                                                           |\n\nAn intangible asset is derecognised on disposal, or when no future economic bene/uniFB01ts are expected from its use or disposal. Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the di/fference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (h) Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /uniFB01nished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\n## \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), /uniFB01nished goods, stock-in-trade and trial run inventories:\n\nValued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods, WIP and trial run inventories includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of stock-in-trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n\n## \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n\nWaste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value for inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the\n\n## (f) Assets (or disposal groups) classi/uniFB01ed as held for sale:\n\nThe Company classi/uniFB01es assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets held for sale' and 'Liabilities held for sale' respectively. Once classi/uniFB01ed as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (g)  Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of non-/uniFB01nancial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have su/ffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/uniFB01ed, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/uniFB01ed.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/uniFB01nite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /uniFB02ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/uniFB02ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/uniFB01c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /uniFB02ows have not been adjusted.",

The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss such that the cumulative expense re/uniFB02ects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee bene/uniFB01ts reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cashsettled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on the fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Treasury Shares:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing the Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (k) Borrowing Costs:\n\nGeneral and speci/uniFB01c borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset\n\nis ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs incurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange di/fference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (l) Government Grants:\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenses, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with Value Added Tax (VAT) / Goods & Services Tax (GST) payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss on the event they become receivable.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income on a systematic basis over the expected useful life of the related asset.\n\nThe bene/uniFB01t of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the di/fference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## (m)  Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/uniFB02ow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the e/ffect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /uniFB02ows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/uniFB02ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/uniFB01c to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as a /uniFB01nance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to re/uniFB02ect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an out/uniFB02ow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/uniFB01rmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Company.\n\nClaims against the Company where the possibility of any out/uniFB02ow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in /uniFB01nancial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /uniFB01nancial statements, where an in/uniFB02ow of economic bene/uniFB01ts is probable.\n\n## (n) Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The costs are reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/uniFB02ect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ndue to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /uniFB01nance cost in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (o) Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (i) Sale of Goods\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/uniFB02ects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is generally on dispatch/ delivery of the goods.\n- \u00b7 Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration and outgoing taxes on sale.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/uniFB01cant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the e/ffects of a signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.",

Contract liabilities are recognised as revenue when the company satis/uniFB01es its performance obligation under the contract.\n\n## (p) Dividend and Interest Income\n\n- \u00b7 Dividend income is accounted for when the right to receive the income is established.\n- \u00b7 Interest income is recognised using the E/ffective Interest Method.\n\n## Lease :\n\nThe Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/uniFB01ed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/uniFB01ed asset, the Company assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/uniFB01ed asset;\n- (ii) the Company has substantially all of the economic bene/uniFB01ts from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nassets (excluding net interest), is re/uniFB02ected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement, is recognized immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss when the plan amendment or when a curtailment or settlement occurs.\n\nThe retirement bene/uniFB01t obligations recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the de\u00fbned bene/uniFB01t obligations reduced by the fair value of scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the scheme. The Company provides bene/uniFB01ts such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plan, payable to the employees is the based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Company and is in accordance with the Rules of the Company for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss. De/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t costs are categorised as follows: service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements); net interest expense or income; and re-measurement.\n\nThe present value of the de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds. The de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual de/uniFB01cit or surplus in the Company's de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/uniFB01ts available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## As a lessee\n\nThe Company recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received.\n\nCertain lease arrangements include the option to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. The right-of-use assets and lease liabilities include these options when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\n\nThe ROU is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the ROU asset or the end of the lease term, but if ownership of the leased asset transfers to the Company at the end of the lease term or the cost re/uniFB02ects the exercise of a purchase option, depreciation is calculated using the estimated useful life of the asset. In addition, the ROU asset is periodically reduced by impairment losses, if any, and adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability.\n\n| Asset Class       | Term (in years)   |\n|-------------------|-------------------|\n| Land              | 2-50              |\n| Building          | 3-11              |\n| Plant & Machinery | 2-14              |\n| Ships             | 8-17              |\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid   at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the company's incremental borrowing rate. Generally, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate.\n\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprises /uniFB01xed payments, including in-substance /uniFB01xed payments, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and the exercise price under a purchase option that the Company is reasonably certain to exercise, lease payments in an optional\n\nrenewal period if the Company is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option.\n\nThe lease liability is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the e/ffective interest method, except those which are payable other than functional currency which is measured at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the company's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if company changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU, or is recorded in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss if the carrying amount of the ROU has been reduced to zero.\n\nLease Liabilities have been presented as separate line and the 'ROU' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/uniFB01ed as /uniFB01nancing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Company has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /uniFB02ows are classi/uniFB01ed as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Company is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/uniFB01ed as a /uniFB01nance or operating lease by reference to the right-ofuse asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (r) Employee bene/uniFB01ts:\n\n## De/uniFB01ned Bene/uniFB01t Plans:\n\nFor de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans, the cost of providing bene/uniFB01ts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/uniFB01ed independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period.

The contributions as speci/uniFB01ed under the law are made to the approved provident fund which is set up by the Company. The Company is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/uniFB01ed minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## De/uniFB01ned contribution plans:\n\nContributions to de/uniFB01ned contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such bene/uniFB01ts. The Company provides bene/uniFB01ts such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Company managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de/uniFB01ned contribution plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Company are eligible for participation in de/uniFB01ned contribution plans such superannuation and national pension fund.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the taxable temporary di/fferences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ffset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are o/ffset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/uniFB01ts will be available against which the temporary di/fference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary di/fference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, a/ffects neither the accounting pro/uniFB01t nor taxable pro/uniFB01t or loss; and\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nshares held by the Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (u) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange di/fferences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange di/fferences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n- \u00b7 exchange di/fferences relating to qualifying e/ffective cash /uniFB02ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (v) Investment in Subsidiaries, Associates and Joint Ventures:\n\nThe Company's investment in its subsidiaries, associates and Joint Ventures are carried at cost net of accumulated impairment loss, if any.\n\nOn disposal of the Investment, the di/fference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (w)  Financial Instruments:\n\nA /uniFB01nancial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a /uniFB01nancial asset of one entity and a /uniFB01nancial liability or equity instrument of another entity.

In the current /uniFB01nancial year ended March 31, 2024 the Company has opted for the New tax regime and accordingly the provision of tax and deferred tax liabilities has been recognized as per New Tax Regime.\n\nIn the previous /uniFB01nancial year ended March 31, 2023 the Company continued with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and di/fferent exemptions and deduction enjoyed by the Company.

The di/fference between the carrying amount of the /uniFB01nancial liability de-recognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Financial Guarantee Contract Liabilities\n\nFinancial Guarantee Contract Liabilities are disclosed in /uniFB01nancial statements in accordance with Ind AS 109, Financial Instruments.\n\n## O/ffsetting of Financial Instruments\n\nFinancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities are o/ffset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the Company currently has a legally enforceable right to set o/ff the amounts and it intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (x) Cash and cash equivalents:\n\nCash and cash equivalents comprise of cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with banks that are readily convertible into cash which are subject to insigni/uniFB01cant risk of changes in value and are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (y) Financial liabilities and equity instruments:\n\n## \u00b7 Classi/uniFB01cation as debt or equity\n\nDebt and equity instruments issued by the Company are classi/uniFB01ed as either /uniFB01nancial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangements and the de/uniFB01nitions of a /uniFB01nancial liability and an equity instrument.\n\n## \u00b7 Equity instruments\n\nAn equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\nThe e/ffective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments (including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the e/ffective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the /uniFB01nancial liability, or (where appropriate) a shorter period, to the amortised cost on initial recognition.\n\nInterest expense (based on the e/ffective interest method), foreign exchange gains and losses, and any gain or loss on derecognition is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Impairment of /uniFB01nancial assets:\n\nExpected credit losses are recognized for all /uniFB01nancial assets subsequent to initial recognition other than /uniFB01nancials assets in FVTPL category. For /uniFB01nancial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Company recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired /uniFB01nancial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the /uniFB01nancial asset has not increased signi/uniFB01cantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on /uniFB01nancial asset increases signi/uniFB01cantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Company's trade receivables do not contain signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component and as per simpli/uniFB01ed approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities:\n\nThe Company derecognises a /uniFB01nancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash /uniFB02ows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the /uniFB01nancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Company recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /uniFB01nancial asset, the Company continues to recognise the /uniFB01nancial asset and also recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.",

        "page_content": "## (z) Derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments:\n\nThe Company enters into derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Company does not hold derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash/uniFB02ow hedge.\n\n## (aa) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash /uniFB02ow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair values or cash /uniFB02ows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe e/ffective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash /uniFB02ow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to e/ffective portion as described above are reclassi/uniFB01ed to Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ffects the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non/uniFB01nancial asset or a non-/uniFB01nancial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non/uniFB01nancial asset or non-/uniFB01nancial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated,\n\nor exercised, or when it no longer quali/uniFB01es for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## (bb) Segment Reporting - Identi/uniFB01cation of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete /uniFB01nancial information is available. Based on the management approach as de/uniFB01ned in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (cc)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash /uniFB02ows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net pro/uniFB01t before tax is adjusted for the e/ffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or /uniFB01nancing cash /uniFB02ows. The cash /uniFB02ows from operating, investing and /uniFB01nancing activities of the Company are segregated.\n\n## (dd) Business Combination and Goodwill:\n\nThe Company applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Company to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Company as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nA business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties\n\n<!-- image -->\n\non the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Company determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Company reassesses whether it has correctly identi/uniFB01ed all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/uniFB01ed, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Company recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/uniFB01ed either as equity or /uniFB01nancial liability. Amount classi/uniFB01ed as /uniFB01nancial liability are subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## (ee)  Material accounting policy information:\n\nThe Company adopted Disclosure of accounting policies (Amendments to Ind AS 1) from 1 April 2023. Although the amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nThe amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'signi/uniFB01cant' accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-speci/uniFB01c accounting policy information that users need to understand other information in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Note 1(C) Use of Estimates and Judgements:\n\nThe  preparation  of  the  Company's  /uniFB01nancial  statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes\n\nboth before and after the business combination and the control is not transitory. The transactions between entities under common control are speci/uniFB01cally covered by Ind AS 103. Such transactions are accounted for using the pooling-of-interest method. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised at their carrying amounts of the Company's /uniFB01nancial statements. The components of equity of the acquired companies are added to the same components within the Company's equity. The /uniFB01nancial statements in respect of prior periods have been restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nIdenti/uniFB01able assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, intangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assets that are acquired separately.\n\nGoodwill is measured as the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identi/uniFB01able assets acquired and liabilities assumed. A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated /uniFB01rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based",

        "page_content": "that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities a/ffected in future periods.\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a signi/uniFB01cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /uniFB01nancial year, are described below. The Company based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /uniFB01nancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are re/uniFB02ected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## Estimates:\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Company uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/ component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/uniFB01t. The Company uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/uniFB01ts and business developments.\n\n## (iii)  Fair value measurement of /uniFB01nancial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using\n\nvaluation techniques including the Discounted Cash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (iv)  De/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t gratuity plan, and other post-employment medical bene/uniFB01ts and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may di/ffer from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (v) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (vi)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Company measures the cost of equity-settled transactions and cash settled transactions with employees using either Black-Scholes model or binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 43.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe cost approach includes calculation of replacement cost using price trends applied to historical cost and capitalisation of all the indirect cost, these trends are on the basis of price indices obtained from recognized sources such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)/ O/ffice of Economic Adviser (OEA) or market intelligence. In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## Judgement:\n\n## Classi/uniFB01cation of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the noncancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Company makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Company considers factors such as any signi/uniFB01cant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Company's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/uniFB02ects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate speci/uniFB01c to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.\n\n## (vii)  Litigation and contingencies:\n\nThe Company has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities. Where an out/uniFB02ow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of speci/uniFB01c circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## (viii) Business  Combination:\n\n## (a) Fair Valuation of Intangibles:\n\n## Mining Reserve:\n\nThe Company has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Company, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /uniFB02ows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## (b) Fair Valuation of Tangibles: Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of similar plots of land, circle rates provided by department of revenue and general market intelligence based on the size of land parcel.\n\n## Leasehold land:\n\nLeasehold land was valued basis the leasehold interest for the remaining duration of the lease.\n\n## Other Assets:\n\nThe cost approach has been adopted for fair valuing all the assets except vehicles which have been measured at the old book values less depreciation.",

The Company had recognised a goodwill of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Note 2: Property, Plant and Equipment, Capital Work-in-Progress, Goodwill, Other Intangible Assets and Intangible Assets under development: (Contd.)\n\n' 2,208.82 Crores based on the di/fference between the fair value of consideration transferred and fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill as at March 31, 2024 with respect to Century Business is ' 2,208.82 Crores (March 31, 2023 (Restated) : ' 2,208.82 Crores).\n\n## (b) Binani Cement Limited (BCL):\n\nThe company had acquired Binani Cement Limited at an enterprise value of ' 7,899.75 Crores and accounted as per Ind AS 103 - Business Combinations with e/ffect from November 20, 2018 as per order dated November 14, 2018 by National Company Law Tribunal. The company had recognised a goodwill of ' 2,925.12 Crores based on the di/fference between the fair value of consideration transferred and fair value of net assets acquired. The carrying amount of goodwill as at March 31, 2024 with respect to BCL is ' 2,925.12 Crores (March 31, 2023 (Restated) : ' 2,925.12 Crores).\n\n- (ii) Goodwill arising out of business combinations has been allocated to the acquired businesses as Cash Generating Unit (CGU). Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. Potential impairment is identi/uniFB01ed by comparing the recoverable value of a CGU to its carrying value.\n\nThe recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future cash /uniFB02ows, after considering current economic conditions, industry trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and anticipated future economic conditions. As at March 31, 2024, the estimated cash /uniFB02ows for a period of 5 years were developed using internal forecasts, and a weighted average cost of capital of ~12% (March 31, 2023: ~ 12%). The cash /uniFB02ows beyond 5 years have been extrapolated assuming nil long-term growth rates.

There have been no changes from the previous periods in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses.\n\n- @ The plan does not invest directly in any property occupied by the Company nor in any /uniFB01nancial securities issued by the Company.\n\n## (xii)  Discount Rate:\n\nThe discount rate is based on the prevailing market rates of Indian government securities for the estimated term of obligations.\n\n## (xiii)  Salary Escalation Rate:\n\nThe estimates of future salary increases are considered taking into account in/uniFB02ation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors.\n\n## (xiv)  Asset Liability matching strategy:\n\nThe money contributed by the Company to the Gratuity fund to /uniFB01nance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested.\n\nThe trustees of the plan have outsourced the investment management of the fund to an insurance Company. The insurance Company in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Company to fully prefund the liability of the Plan. The Company's philosophy is to fund these bene/uniFB01ts based on its own liquidity and the level of underfunding of the plan.\n\n- (xv) The Company's expected contribution during next year is ' 1.94 Crores (March 31, 2023 (Restated): ' 1.85 Crores).\n\n## (d) Provident Fund:\n\nThe Company is liable for any shortfall in the fund assets based on the Government speci/uniFB01ed rate of return. Such shortfall, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as an expense in the year of incurring the same.\n\nAmount recognized as an expense under the head 'Contribution to Provident and other Funds' of Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss ' 107.37 Crores (March 31, 2023 (Restated): ' 98.36 Crores).",

The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of /uniFB01nancial instruments are:\n\nLevel 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n\nLevel 2: The fair value of /uniFB01nancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/uniFB01c estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all signi/uniFB01cant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the signi/uniFB01cant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level\n\n|                                                             | '  in Crores           | '  in Crores                       |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Particulars                                                 | As at   March 31, 2024 | As at   March 31, 2023  (Restated) |\n| Financial Assets at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss |                        |                                    |\n| Investments - Level 2                                       | 6,665.90               | 6,226.42                           |\n| Investments - Level 3                                       | 262.30                 | 1,291.82                           |\n| Fair Value Hedging Instruments                              |                        |                                    |\n| Derivative assets - Level 2                                 | 482.18                 | 473.71                             |\n| Total                                                       | 7,410.38               | 7,991.95                           |\n| Derivative Liabilities - Level 2                            | -                      | 103.76                             |",

The main purpose of these /uniFB01nancial liabilities is to /uniFB01nance the Company's operations. The Company's principal /uniFB01nancial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Company's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Company's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /uniFB01nancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse e/ffects on the /uniFB01nancial performance of the Company. The Company uses derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /uniFB01xed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The sources of risks that the Company is exposed to and their management is given below:\n\n| Risk                      | Exposure Arising From                                                                               |                                                                                                            | Measurement Management                                             |\n|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                           |                                                                                                     |                                                                                                            | Market Risk                                                        |\n| A)  Foreign Currency Risk | Committed commercial  transaction Financial asset and Liabilities not  denominated in INR           | (a)  Forward foreign exchange  contracts (b)  Foreign currency options (c)  Principal only/Currency  swaps | Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis                         |\n| B)  Interest Rate Risk    | Long Term Borrowings at variable  rates Investments in Debt Schemes of  Mutual Funds and Other Debt | (a)  Interest Rate swaps,  Coupon only swaps (b)  Portfolio Diversi/uniFB01cation                          | Sensitivity Analysis, Interest  rate movements                     |\n| C)  Commodity Price Risk  | Movement in prices of  commodities mainly Imported  Thermal Coal and Pet Coke                       | (a)  Commodity Fixed Prices                                                                                | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price tracking (b)  Swaps/Options |\n| Credit Risk               | Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative Financial instruments,  Loans and Bank balances         | (a)  Diversi/uniFB01cation of mutual  fund investments, (b)  Credit limit & credit                         | II)  Ageing analysis, Credit Rating                                |\n| Liquidity Risks           | Borrowings and Other Liabilities  and Liquid Investments                                            | (a)  Adequate unused credit  lines and borrowing  facilities (b)  Portfolio Diversi/uniFB01cation          | III) Rolling cash /uniFB02ow forecasts  Broker Quotes              |\n\nThe Company has standard operating procedures and investment policy for deployment of surplus liquidity, which allows investment in debt securities, /uniFB01xed deposits and mutual fund schemes of debt categories only and restricts the exposure in equity markets.\n\nCompliances of these policies and principles are reviewed by the internal auditors/internal risk management committee on periodical basis.\n\nThe Corporate Treasury team updates the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis about the implementation of the above policies.

The value of a /uniFB01nancial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that a/ffect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /uniFB01nancial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## (A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash /uniFB02ows of an exposure in foreign currency, which /uniFB02uctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials and spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps, options and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2024   | '  in Crores March 31, 2023  (Restated)   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Trade Receivables                                     |                  |                                           |\n| USD                                                   | 0.45             | 0.41                                      |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                                           |\n| USD                                                   | 40.34            | 37.91                                     |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.15             | 0.40                                      |\n| Others                                                | -                | 0.15                                      |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                                           |\n| USD                                                   | 45.00            | 40.00                                     |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                                           |\n| USD                                                   | 20.92            | 34.92                                     |\n| LKR                                                   | 0.65             | 0.65                                      |\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on pro/uniFB01t before tax and equity.\n\n'\n\nin Crores\n\n| Particulars   | As at   March 31, 2024   |   As at   March 31, 2023  (Restated) |\n|---------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| USD           | -                        |                                 0    |\n| LKR           | 0.02                     |                                 0.03 |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps pro/uniFB01t will decrease by an equal amount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (B) Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash /uniFB02ows of a /uniFB01nancial instrument will /uniFB02uctuate because of changes in market interest rates.

Since the Energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any adverse /uniFB02uctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company enters into /uniFB01xed price swaps/other derivatives for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of supply etc. While /uniFB01xed price swaps/other derivatives are available in the markets for coal but in case of pet coke no such derivative is available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirement are monitored by the central procurement team.\n\n## (II) Credit Risk Management:\n\nCredit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a /uniFB01nancial instrument or customer contract, leading to a /uniFB01nancial loss. The Company is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its /uniFB01nancing / investing activities, including deposits with banks//uniFB01nancial institutions, mutual fund investments, and investments in debt securities, foreign exchange transactions and /uniFB01nancial guarantees. The Company has no signi/uniFB01cant concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.\n\n## Trade receivables\n\nTrade receivables are consisting of a large number of customers. The Company has credit evaluation policy for each customer and based on the evaluation credit limit of each customer is de/uniFB01ned. Wherever the Company assesses the credit risk as high the exposure is backed by either bank guarantee / letter of credit or security deposits.\n\nTotal Trade receivable as on March 31, 2024 is ' 3,496.54 Crores (March 31, 2023 (Restated) ' 3,242.17 Crores). The Company does not have higher concentration of credit risks to a single customer. A single largest customer has total exposure in sales 2.56% (March 31, 2023 (Restated): 2.93%) and in receivables 5.73% (March 31, 2023 (Restated): 11.11%)\n\nAs per simpli/uniFB01ed approach, the Company makes provision of expected credit losses on trade receivables using a provision matrix to mitigate the risk of default payments and makes appropriate provision at each reporting date wherever outstanding is for longer period and involves higher risk.",

Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining su/fficient cash and marketable securities and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of credit facilities to meet obligations when due. The Company's treasury team is responsible for liquidity, funding as well as settlement management. In addition, processes and policies related to such risks are overseen by senior management. Management monitors the Company's liquidity position through rolling forecasts on the basis of expected cash /uniFB02ows.\n\nThe table below provides details regarding the remaining contractual maturities of /uniFB01nancial liabilities and investments held for managing the risk at the reporting date based on contractual undiscounted payments.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| As at March 31, 2024                                                                         | Less than   1 Year   | 1 to 5 Years   | More than   5 Years   | Total    | '  in Crores Carrying Value   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|----------------|-----------------------|----------|-------------------------------|\n| Borrowings (including current maturities of long- term debts) and Interest on Borrowings     | 3,321.84             | 1,919.60       | 4,241.89              | 9,483.33 | 8,087.33                      |\n| Trade Payables                                                                               | 8,115.97             | -

Our responsibilities under those SAs are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group, its associates and joint venture in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements in terms of the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the relevant provisions of the Act, and we have ful/uniFB01lled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us along with the consideration of reports of the one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors referred to in paragraph (a) and (b) of the 'Other Matters' section below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Emphasis of Matter\n\nWe draw attention to Note 37(b) of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements which refers to orders dated 31 August 2016 (Penalty of Rs.1,616.83 crores) and 19 January 2017 (Penalty of Rs. 68.30 crores) of the Competition Commission of India ('CCI') against which the Company (including erstwhile UltraTech Nathdwara Cement Limited) had /uniFB01led appeals. Upon the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal ('NCLAT') disallowing its appeals against the CCI order dated 31 August 2016, the Company has /uniFB01led appeals before the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, which has by its order dated 5 October 2018, granted a stay against the NCLAT order. Consequently, the Company has deposited an amount of Rs. 161.68 crores equivalent to 10% of the penalty of Rs. 1,616.83 crores recorded as asset. The Company, backed by legal opinions, believes that it has a good case in both the matters basis which no provision has been recognised in the books of account. Our opinion is not modi/uniFB01ed in respect of these matters.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment and based on the consideration of reports of the one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors on separate/consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements of components audited by them, were of most signi/uniFB01cance in our audit of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint venture are responsible for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of each company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; the selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls, that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the  consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements by the Management and Board of Directors of the Holding Company, as aforesaid.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements, the respective Management and Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint venture are responsible for assessing the ability of each company to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and of its associates and joint venture are responsible for overseeing the /uniFB01nancial reporting process of each company.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to in/uniFB02uence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \u00b7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the company has adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements in place and the operating e/ffectiveness of such controls.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Management and Board of Directors.\n- \u00b7 Conclude on the appropriateness of the Management and Board of Directors use of the going concern basis of accounting in preparation of consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signi/uniFB01cant doubt on the appropriateness of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nthis assumption. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its associates and joint venture to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- \u00b7 Obtain su/fficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the /uniFB01nancial statements//uniFB01nancial information of such entities or business activities within the Group and its associates and joint venture to express an opinion on the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the /uniFB01nancial statements//uniFB01nancial information of such entities included in the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements of which we are the independent auditors. For the other entities included in the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements, which have been audited by one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors, such one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors remain responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audits carried out by them.

These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls that were operating e/ffectively for ensuring the orderly and e/fficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable /uniFB01nancial information, as required under the Act.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibility\n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note and the Standards on Auditing, prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Act, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements were established and maintained and if such controls operated e/ffectively in all material respects.\n\nOur audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements and their operating e/ffectiveness. Our audit of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements included obtaining an understanding of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating e/ffectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by one of the joint auditors of the Parent and other auditors of the relevant subsidiaries and associates in terms of their reports referred to in the Other Matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nparagraph below, is su/fficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Meaning of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nA company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of /uniFB01nancial reporting and the preparation of /uniFB01nancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements include those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly re/uniFB02ect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of /uniFB01nancial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material e/ffect on the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls with Reference to Financial Statements\n\nBecause of the inherent limitations of internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Other Matters\n\nOur aforesaid report under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act on the adequacy and operating e/ffectiveness of the internal /uniFB01nancial controls with reference to /uniFB01nancial statements//uniFB01nancial information insofar as it relates to three subsidiaries and six associates, which are companies incorporated in India, is based on the corresponding reports of the auditors of such companies incorporated in India.\n\nOur opinion is not modi/uniFB01ed in respect of above matters.\n\n## For B S R & Co.

Advances given towards acquisition or construction of PPE outstanding at each reporting date are disclosed as Capital Advances under 'Other non-current Assets'.\n\n## (c) Depreciation:\n\nDepreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of PPE over its useful life and is provided on a straight-line basis over the useful lives as prescribed in Schedule II to the Act or as per technical assessment. Freehold Land with inde/uniFB01nite life is not depreciated.\n\nDepreciable amount for PPE is the cost of PPE less its estimated residual value. The useful life of PPE is the period over which PPE is expected to be available for use by the Group, or the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by the Group.\n\nIn case of certain classes of PPE, the Group uses di/fferent useful lives than those prescribed in Schedule II to the Act. The useful lives have been assessed based on technical advice, taking into account the nature of the PPE and the estimated usage of the asset on the basis of management's best estimation of obtaining economic bene/uniFB01ts from those classes of assets. The estimated useful lives, residual values and the depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the e/ffect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\na liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nAll other assets are classi/uniFB01ed as non-current.\n\nSimilarly, a liability is classi/uniFB01ed as current if:\n\n- (i) It is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle; or\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- It is held primarily for the purpose of trading; or\n- (iii) It is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or\n- (iv) The Group does not have an unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments at the option of the counterparty does not a/ffect this classi/uniFB01cation.\n\nAll other liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as non-current.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as noncurrent only.\n\n## (b)  Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE):\n\nThe cost of an item of PPE is recognised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\nThe initial cost of PPE comprises its purchase price, net of any trade discounts and rebates, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use, including relevant borrowing costs and any expected costs of decommissioning.\n\nSubsequent costs incurred are included in the asset's carrying amount or recognized as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All other repairs and maintenance cost are charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss during the period in which they were incurred.\n\nIf signi/uniFB01cant parts of an item of PPE have di/fferent useful lives, then they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of PPE.\n\nMaterial items such as spare parts, stand-by equipment and service equipment are classi/uniFB01ed as PPE when they",

Expenditure incurred on development is capitalised as an asset if it is probable that future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the company and cost can be measured reliably, otherwise such expenditure is charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nSubsequent costs incurred are capitalized, only when it increase the future economic bene/uniFB01ts associated with the item will /uniFB02ow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.\n\n## \u00b7 Intangible Assets acquired separately:\n\nIntangible assets with /uniFB01nite useful lives that are acquired separately are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment loss, if any. Cost comprises the purchase price (net of tax / duty credits availed wherever applicable) and any directly attributable cost of bringing the assets to its working condition for its intended use. The Group determines the amortisation period as the period over which the future economic bene/uniFB01ts will /uniFB02ow to the Group after taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances.

Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an item of intangible asset are measured as the di/fference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of such item of intangible asset and are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss when the asset is derecognised.\n\n## (e) Assets/ Disposal Group classi/uniFB01ed as held for sale:\n\nThe Group classi/uniFB01es assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWhen an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (g)  Inventories:\n\nInventories are valued as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 Raw materials, fuel, stores & spares and packing materials:\n\nValued at lower of cost and net realisable value (NRV). However, these items are considered to be realisable at cost, if the /uniFB01nished products, in which they will be used, are expected to be sold at or above cost. Cost is determined on weighted average basis which includes expenditure incurred for acquiring inventories like purchase price, import duties, taxes (net of tax credit) and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.\n\n## \u00b7 Work-in- progress (WIP), /uniFB01nished goods, stock-in-trade and trial run inventories:\n\nValued at lower of cost and NRV. Cost of Finished goods and WIP includes cost of raw materials, cost of conversion and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost of stock-in-trade includes cost of purchase and other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to the present location and condition. Cost of inventories is computed on weighted average basis.\n\n## \u00b7 Waste / Scrap:\n\nWaste / Scrap inventory is valued at NRV.\n\nNet realisable value for inventories is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (h) Employee Share based payments:\n\nEquity-settled share-based payments to employees are measured at the fair value of the employee stock options at the grant date using an appropriate valuation model.\n\na sale transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such asset and its sale is highly probable. Such assets or group of assets / liabilities are presented separately in the Balance Sheet, in the line 'Assets/ Disposal Group held for sale' and 'Liabilities/ Disposal Group held for sale' respectively. Once classi/uniFB01ed as held for sale, intangible assets and PPE are no longer amortised or depreciated.\n\nSuch assets or disposal groups held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.\n\n## (f) Impairment of Non-Financial Assets\n\nAt the end of each reporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of non-/uniFB01nancial assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have su/ffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. When a reasonable and consistent basis of allocation can be identi/uniFB01ed, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group of cash-generating units for which a reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identi/uniFB01ed.\n\nIntangible assets with inde/uniFB01nite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.\n\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash /uniFB02ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re/uniFB02ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speci/uniFB01c to the asset for which the estimates of future cash /uniFB02ows have not been adjusted.\n\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashgenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.",

The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss such that the cumulative expense re/uniFB02ects the revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to the equity-settled employee bene/uniFB01ts reserve.\n\nFor Stock Appreciation Rights ('SARs') which are cashsettled share-based payments, the fair value of liability is recognised for the services acquired over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the payment. At the end of each reporting period until the liability is settled, and at the date of settlement, the liability is re-measured based on fair value of the SAR's and any changes in fair value of the liability are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## (i) Treasury Shares:\n\nThe Holding Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing its shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employee Stock Options Scheme, 2018. The Holding Company has considered the said Employee Welfare Trust as its extension and shares held by the Trust is treated as Treasury Shares. As per Ind AS 32, the consideration paid for treasury shares including any directly attributable incremental cost is presented as a deduction from total equity, until they are cancelled, sold or reissued.\n\n## (j) Borrowing Costs:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGeneral and speci/uniFB01c borrowing costs that are attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are capitalised as part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use and borrowing costs are being incurred. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use. All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.\n\nBorrowing cost includes interest expense, amortization of discounts, hedge related cost incurred in connection with foreign currency borrowings, ancillary costs\n\nincurred in connection with borrowing of funds and exchange di/fference arising from foreign currency borrowings to the extent they are regarded as an adjustment to the Interest cost.\n\n## (k) Government Grants:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGovernment grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Company will comply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.\n\nGovernment grants related to expenses, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss on a systematic basis over the periods in which the Company recognises the related costs for which the grants are intended to compensate.\n\nGovernment grants related to income under State Investment Promotion Scheme linked with Value Added Tax (VAT) / Goods & Services Tax (GST) payment, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss on the event they become receivable.\n\nWhere the grant relates to an asset, it is recognised as income in equal amounts over the expected useful life of the related asset.\n\nThe bene/uniFB01t of a government loan at a below-market rate of interest is treated as a government grant, measured as the di/fference between proceeds received and the fair value of the loan based on prevailing market interest rates. and is being recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## (l) Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets:\n\nProvisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event and it is probable that an out/uniFB02ow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.\n\nIf the e/ffect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash /uniFB02ows to net present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate that re/uniFB02ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks speci/uniFB01c to the liability. Unwinding of the discount is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as a /uniFB01nance cost. Provisions are reviewed at each reporting date and are adjusted to re/uniFB02ect the current best estimate.\n\nA present obligation that arises from past events where it is either not probable that an out/uniFB02ow of resources will be required to settle or a reliable estimate of the amount cannot be made, is disclosed as a contingent liability. Contingent liabilities are also disclosed when there is a possible obligation arising from past events, the existence of which will be con/uniFB01rmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.\n\nClaims against the Group where the possibility of any out/uniFB02ow of resources in settlement is remote, are not disclosed as contingent liabilities.\n\nContingent assets are not recognised in /uniFB01nancial statements since this may result in the recognition of income that may never be realised. However, when the realisation of income is virtually certain, then the related asset is not a contingent asset and is recognised. A contingent asset is disclosed, in /uniFB01nancial statements, where an in/uniFB02ow of economic bene/uniFB01ts is probable.\n\n## (m)  Mines Restoration Provision:\n\nAn obligation for restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing extraction from mines. Costs arising from restoration at closure of the mines and other site preparation work are provided for based on their discounted net present value, with a corresponding amount being capitalised at the start of each project. The amount provided for is recognised, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision. The cost is reviewed periodically and are adjusted to re/uniFB02ect known developments which may have an impact on the cost or life of operations. The cost of the related asset is adjusted for changes in the provision due to factors such as updated cost estimates, new disturbance, and revisions to discount rates. The adjusted cost of the asset is depreciated prospectively over the lives of the assets to which they relate. The unwinding of the discount is shown as a /uniFB01nance cost in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (n) Revenue Recognition from Contracts with Customers:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (i) Sale of Goods\n\n- \u00b7 Revenue is recognized on the basis of approved contracts regarding the transfer of goods or services to a customer for an amount that re/uniFB02ects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Revenue from sale of goods is recognised at the point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which is generally on dispatch/ delivery of the goods.\n- \u00b7 Revenue towards satisfaction of a performance obligation is measured at the amount of transaction price (net of variable consideration) allocated to that performance obligation. The transaction price of goods sold and services rendered is net of variable consideration and outgoing taxes on sale.\n- \u00b7 Variable consideration - This includes incentives, volume rebates, discounts etc. It is estimated at contract inception considering the terms of various schemes with customers and constrained until it is highly probable that a signi/uniFB01cant revenue reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the associated uncertainty with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. It is reassessed at end of each reporting period.\n- \u00b7 Signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component - Generally, the Company receives short-term advances from its customers. Using the practical expedient in Ind AS 115, the Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the e/ffects of a signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component if it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of the promised good or service to the customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\n\n## (ii) Rendering of Services\n\nRevenue from services rendered are recognized over the time as the services are performed based on agreements/arrangements with the customers.",

The Group provides bene/uniFB01ts such as gratuity, pension and provident fund to its employees which are treated as de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans.\n\n## Gratuity\n\nThe gratuity, a de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plan, payable to the employees is based on the Employees' service and last drawn salary at the time of the leaving of the services of the Group and is in accordance with the Rules of the Group for payment of Gratuity. Past service cost is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the period of a plan amendment. Interest is calculated by applying the discount rate at the beginning of the period to the net de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t liability or asset and is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss. De/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t costs are categorised as follows:\n\n- \u00b7 service cost (including current service cost, past service cost, as well as gains and losses on curtailments and settlements);\n- \u00b7 net interest expense or income; and\n- \u00b7 re-measurement\n\nThe present value of the de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plan liability is calculated using a discount rate which is determined by reference to market yields at the end of the reporting period on government bonds.\n\nThe de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t obligation recognised in the Balance Sheet represents the actual de/uniFB01cit or surplus in the Group's de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans. Any surplus resulting from this calculation is limited to the present value of any economic bene/uniFB01ts available in the form of refunds from the plans or reductions in future contributions to the plans.\n\n## Provident Fund\n\nThe eligible employees of the Group are entitled to receive bene/uniFB01ts in respect of provident fund, which is a de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plan, for which both the employees and the Group make monthly contributions at a speci/uniFB01ed percentage of the covered employees' salary.\n\n(p)\n\n## Lease:\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at the inception of the contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/uniFB01ed asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identi/uniFB01ed asset, the Group assesses whether\n\n- (i) the contract involves the use of identi/uniFB01ed asset;\n- (ii) the Group has substantially all of the economic bene/uniFB01ts from the use of the asset through the period of lease and;\n- (iii) the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset.\n\n## As a lessee:\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use asset ('ROU') and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The ROU is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncurrency which is measured at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group's estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option.\n\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the ROU or is recorded in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero.\n\n'Lease Liabilities' and 'Right of Use Assets' have been presented separately in the Balance Sheet. Lease payments have been classi/uniFB01ed as /uniFB01nancing activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## Short-term leases and leases of low-value assets\n\nThe Group has elected not to recognise ROU and lease liabilities for short term leases that have a lease term of 12 months or lower and leases of low value assets. The Company recognises the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense over the lease term. The related cash /uniFB02ows are classi/uniFB01ed as Operating activities in the Statement of Cash Flows.\n\n## As a lessor\n\nWhen the Group is an intermediate lessor, it accounts for its interests in the head lease and the sublease separately. The sublease is classi/uniFB01ed as a /uniFB01nance or operating lease by reference to the right of use asset arising from the head lease.\n\n## (q) Employee bene/uniFB01ts:\n\n## De/uniFB01ned Bene/uniFB01t Plans:\n\nFor de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans, the cost of providing bene/uniFB01ts is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out by a quali/uniFB01ed independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period. Re-measurement, comprising actuarial gains and losses, the e/ffect of the changes to the asset ceiling (if applicable) and the return on plan assets (excluding net interest), is re/uniFB02ected immediately in the Balance Sheet with a charge or credit recognised in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) in the period in which they occur. Past service cost, both vested and unvested, is recognised as an expense on the plan amendment or when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement,",

The Group is liable for annual contributions and any shortfall in the fund assets based on the government speci/uniFB01ed minimum rates of return and recognises such contributions and shortfall, if any, as an expense in the year incurred.\n\n## De/uniFB01ned contribution plans:\n\nContributions to de/uniFB01ned contribution plans are recognised as expense when employees have rendered services entitling them to such bene/uniFB01ts. The Group provides bene/uniFB01ts such as superannuation, provident fund (other than Group managed fund) to its employees which are treated as de/uniFB01ned contribution plans.\n\n## Superannuation\n\nCertain employees of the Group are eligible for participation in de/uniFB01ned contribution plans such as superannuation and national pension fund. Contributions towards these funds are recognized as an expense periodically based on the contribution by the Group, since the Group has no further obligation beyond its periodic contribution.\n\n## Other employee bene/uniFB01ts:\n\nA liability is recognised for bene/uniFB01ts accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annual leave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of short-term employee bene/uniFB01ts are measured at the undiscounted amount of the bene/uniFB01ts expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.\n\nLiabilities recognised in respect of other long-term employee bene/uniFB01ts are measured using the Projected Unit Credit method by a quali/uniFB01ed independent actuary at the end of each annual reporting period, at the present value of the estimated future cash out/uniFB02ows expected to be made by the Group in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. With reference to some employees, liability of other /uniFB01xed long-term employee bene/uniFB01ts is recognised at the present value of the future cash out/uniFB02ows expected to be made by the Group.\n\nRemeasurement gains / losses are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the period in which they arise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (r) Income Taxes:\n\nIncome Tax expenses comprise current tax and deferred tax charge or credit.\n\nCurrent Tax is measured on the basis of estimated taxable income for the current accounting period in accordance with the applicable tax rates and the provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 and other applicable tax laws.\n\nDeferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary di/fferences and deferred tax asset are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences, carry forward of unused tax losses, carry forward of unused tax credits at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary di/fferences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Tax relating to items recognised directly in equity or OCI is recognised in equity or OCI and not in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss\n\nCurrent tax assets and current tax liabilities are o/ffset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle the asset and the liability on a net basis. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are o/ffset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o/ff current tax assets against current tax liabilities; and the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.\n\nA deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro/uniFB01ts will be available against which the temporary di/fference can be utilized except:\n\n- a) When the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary di/fference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, a/ffects neither the accounting pro/uniFB01t nor taxable pro/uniFB01t or loss; and\n- b) In respect of deductible temporary di/fferences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary di/fferences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable pro/uniFB01t will be available against which the\n\ntemporary di/fferences can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are recognised / reduced to the extent that it is probable / no longer probable respectively that the related tax bene/uniFB01t will be realised.\n\nThe Government of India, on September 20, 2019, vide the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2019, inserted a new Section 115BAA in the Income Tax Act, 1961, which provides an option to the Holding Company for paying Income Tax at reduced rates as per the provisions/conditions de/uniFB01ned in the said section ('New Tax Regime'). In the current /uniFB01nancial year ended March 31, 2024 the Company has opted for the New tax regime and accordingly the provision of tax and deferred tax liabilities has been recognized as per New Tax Regime.\n\nIn the previous /uniFB01nancial year ended March 31, 2023 the Holding Company continued with higher income tax rate option, based on the available outstanding MAT credit entitlement and di/fferent exemptions & deduction enjoyed by the Holding Company. However, the Holding Company had estimated and applied the lower income tax rate on the deferred tax assets / liabilities to the extent these are expected to be realized or settled in the future period when the Holding Company may be subjected to lower tax rate.\n\n## (s) Earnings Per Share:\n\nBasic Earnings Per Share ('EPS') is computed by dividing the net pro/uniFB01t / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders by the weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year. The weighted average number of equity shares outstanding during the year is adjusted for treasury shares.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, net pro/uniFB01t / (loss) after tax for the year attributable to the equity shareholders is divided by the weighted average number of equity shares which could have been issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential equity shares and is adjusted for the treasury shares held by the Holding Company to satisfy the exercise of the share options by the employees.\n\n## (t) Foreign Currency transactions:\n\nTransactions in currencies other than the Holding Company's functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nat the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transactions.\n\nExchange di/fferences on monetary items are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss in the period in which they arise except for:\n\n- \u00b7 exchange di/fferences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for future productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;\n- exchange di/fferences relating to qualifying e/ffective cash /uniFB02ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges in foreign operations which are recognised in OCI.\n\n## (u) Foreign operations:\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into INR, the functional currency of the Holding Company, at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into INR at the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions or an average rate if the average rate approximates the actual rate at the date of the transaction. Exchange di/fferences are recognized in OCI and accumulated in equity (as exchange di/fferences on translating the /uniFB01nancial statements of a foreign operation), except to the extent that the exchange di/fferences are allocated to NCI.\n\nWhen a foreign operation is disposed of in its entirety or partially such that control, signi/uniFB01cant in/uniFB02uence or joint control is lost, the cumulative amount of exchange di/fferences related to that foreign operation recognized in OCI is reclassi/uniFB01ed to Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.

Financial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities are recognised when a Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instruments.\n\n## Initial Recognition:\n\nFinancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities (other than /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss and ancillary costs related to borrowings) are added to or deducted from the fair value of the /uniFB01nancial assets or /uniFB01nancial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of /uniFB01nancial assets or /uniFB01nancial liabilities at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss are charged to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss over the tenure of the /uniFB01nancial assets or /uniFB01nancial liabilities.  However, trade receivables that do not contain a signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component are measured at transaction price (net of variable consideration).\n\n## Classi/uniFB01cation and Subsequent Measurement: Financial Assets\n\nThe Group classi/uniFB01es /uniFB01nancial assets as subsequently measured at amortised cost, Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income ('FVOCI') or Fair Value through Pro/uniFB01t or Loss ('FVTPL') on the basis of following:\n\n- \u00b7 the entity's business model for managing the /uniFB01nancial assets and\n- \u00b7 the contractual cash /uniFB02ow characteristics of the /uniFB01nancial asset.\n\n## Amortised Cost:\n\nA /uniFB01nancial asset shall be classi/uniFB01ed and measured at amortised cost if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the /uniFB01nancial asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold /uniFB01nancial assets in order to collect contractual cash /uniFB02ows and\n\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the /uniFB01nancial asset give rise on speci/uniFB01ed dates to cash /uniFB02ows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nIn case of /uniFB01nancial assets classi/uniFB01ed and measured at amortised cost, any interest income, foreign exchange gains or losses and impairment are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Fair Value through OCI (FVTOCI):\n\nA /uniFB01nancial asset shall be classi/uniFB01ed and measured at fair value through OCI if both of the following conditions are met:\n\n- \u00b7 the /uniFB01nancial asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash /uniFB02ows and selling /uniFB01nancial assets and\n- \u00b7 the contractual terms of the /uniFB01nancial asset give rise on speci/uniFB01ed dates to cash /uniFB02ows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\n## Fair Value through Pro/uniFB01t or Loss (FVTPL):\n\nA /uniFB01nancial asset shall be classi/uniFB01ed and measured at fair value through pro/uniFB01t or loss unless it is measured at amortised cost or at fair value through OCI.\n\nFor /uniFB01nancial assets at FVTPL, net gains or losses, interest or dividend income, are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nAll recognised /uniFB01nancial assets are subsequently measured in their entirety either at amortised cost or fair value, depending on the classi/uniFB01cation of the /uniFB01nancial assets. Financial assets are not reclassi/uniFB01ed subsequent to their initial recognition unless the Group changes its business model for managing /uniFB01nancial assets, in which case all a/ffected /uniFB01nancial assets are reclassi/uniFB01ed on the /uniFB01rst day of the /uniFB01rst reporting period following the change in the business model.\n\n## Classi/uniFB01cation and Subsequent Measurement: Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as either Financial Liabilities at FVTPL or Other Financial Liabilities.\n\n## Financial Liabilities at FVTPL:\n\nFinancial liabilities are classi/uniFB01ed as at FVTPL when the /uniFB01nancial liability is held for trading or is a derivative\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nexpire, or when it transfers the /uniFB01nancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another party. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred /uniFB01nancial asset, the Group continues to recognise the /uniFB01nancial asset and recognises an associated liability for amounts it has to pay.\n\nOn derecognition of a /uniFB01nancial asset, the di/fference between the asset's carrying amount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nThe Group de-recognises /uniFB01nancial liabilities when and only when, the Group's obligations are discharged, cancelled or have expired.

For /uniFB01nancial assets other than trade receivables, as per Ind AS 109, the Group recognises 12 month expected credit losses for all originated or acquired /uniFB01nancial assets if at the reporting date the credit risk of the /uniFB01nancial asset has not increased signi/uniFB01cantly since its initial recognition. The expected credit losses are measured as lifetime expected credit losses if the credit risk on /uniFB01nancial asset increases signi/uniFB01cantly since its initial recognition.\n\nThe Group's trade receivables do not contain signi/uniFB01cant /uniFB01nancing component and as per simpli/uniFB01ed approach, loss allowances on trade receivables are measured using provision matrix at an amount equal to life time expected losses i.e. expected cash shortfall.\n\nThe impairment losses and reversals are recognised in Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\n## Derecognition of /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities:\n\nThe Group derecognises a /uniFB01nancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash /uniFB02ows from the asset",

A cash generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when, there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the CGU is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated /uniFB01rst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognised in pro/uniFB01t or loss. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.\n\nWhere goodwill has been allocated to a CGU and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative values of the disposed operation and the portion of the CGU retained. If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration transferred, the excess is termed as bargain purchase.\n\nIn case of a bargain purchase, before recognizing a gain in respect thereof, the Group determines whether there exists clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase thereafter, the Group reassesses whether it has correctly identi/uniFB01ed all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recognises any additional assets or liabilities that are so identi/uniFB01ed, any gain thereafter is recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity as Capital Reserve. If there does not exist clear evidence of the underlying reasons for classifying the Business combination as a bargain purchase, the Group recognises the gain, after reassessing and reviewing, directly in equity as Capital Reserve.\n\nContingent consideration is classi/uniFB01ed either as equity or /uniFB01nancial liability.

Equity instruments issued by a Company are recognised at the proceeds received.\n\n## (y) Derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments:\n\nThe Group enters into derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign exchange rate risks and commodity prices. The Group does not hold derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments for speculative purposes.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss immediately excluding derivatives designated as cash/uniFB02ow hedge or used in a net investment hedge.\n\n## (z) Hedge accounting:\n\nThe Group designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and commodity price risk as cash /uniFB02ow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly e/ffective in o/ffsetting changes in fair values or cash /uniFB02ows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nThe e/ffective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash /uniFB02ow hedges is recognised in OCI and accumulated under equity. The gain or loss relating to the ine/ffective portion is recognised immediately in pro/uniFB01t or loss.\n\nAmounts previously recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity relating to e/ffective portion as described above are reclassi/uniFB01ed to Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss in the periods when the hedged item a/ffects\n\nthe Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non/uniFB01nancial asset or a non-/uniFB01nancial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non/uniFB01nancial asset or non-/uniFB01nancial liability.\n\nHedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer quali/uniFB01es for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in OCI and accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.\n\nThe Group also hedges its risk of change in foreign exchange rates associated with net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries with a di/fferent functional currency than the Group's functional currency. Net investment hedges are accounted for similar to cash /uniFB02ow hedges and accordingly, any foreign exchange di/fferences on the hedging instrument relating to the e/ffective portion of the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation reserve ('FCTR') so as to o/ffset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. The ine/ffective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is immediately recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss. The amounts accumulated in equity are included in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss when the foreign operation is disposed or partially disposed.\n\n## (aa) Segment Reporting: Identi/uniFB01cation of Segments:\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Company that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ('CODM') to make decisions for which discrete /uniFB01nancial information is available. Based on the management approach as de/uniFB01ned in Ind AS 108, the CODM evaluates the Company's performance and allocates resources based on an analysis of various performance indicators by business segments and geographic segments.\n\n## (bb) Goodwill:\n\nGoodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.\n\n## (cc)  Cash Flow Statement:\n\nCash /uniFB02ows are reported using the indirect method, whereby the net pro/uniFB01t before tax is adjusted for the e/ffects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and item of income or expenses associated with investing or /uniFB01nancing cash /uniFB02ows. The cash /uniFB02ows from operating, investing and /uniFB01nancing activities of the Group are segregated.\n\n## (dd) Business Combination and Goodwill:\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method in accounting for business combinations. The consideration transferred by the Group to obtain control of a business is calculated as the sum of the fair values of assets transferred, liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group as at the acquisition date i.e. date on which it obtains control of the acquiree which includes the fair value of any asset or liability arising from a contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss as incurred, except to the extent related to the issue of debt or equity securities.\n\nA business combination involving entities or businesses under common control is a business combination in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and the control is not transitory. The transactions between entities under common control are speci/uniFB01cally covered by Ind AS 103. Such transactions are accounted for using the pooling-of-interest method. The assets and liabilities of the acquired entity are recognised at their carrying amounts of the Company's /uniFB01nancial statements. The components of equity of the acquired companies are added to the same components within the Company's equity. The /uniFB01nancial statements in respect of prior periods have been restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nIdenti/uniFB01able assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values on acquisition-date.\n\nIntangible Assets acquired in a Business Combination and recognised separately from Goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).",

Although the amendments did not result in any changes in the accounting policies themselves, they impacted the accounting policy information disclosed in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\nThe amendments require the disclosure of 'material' rather than 'signi/uniFB01cant' accounting policies. The amendments also provide guidance on the application of materiality to disclosure of accounting policies, assisting entities to provide useful, entity-speci/uniFB01c accounting policy information that users need to understand other information in the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## 1(C)  Use of Estimates and Judgements:\n\nThe preparation of the Groups /uniFB01nancial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the accompanying disclosures, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about\n\nthese assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets or liabilities a/ffected in future periods.\n\nThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the reporting date, that have a signi/uniFB01cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next /uniFB01nancial year, are described below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the /uniFB01nancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are re/uniFB02ected in the assumptions when they occur.\n\n## Estimates:\n\n## (i) Useful Lives of Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets:\n\nThe Group uses its technical expertise along with historical and industry trends for determining the economic life of an asset/component of an asset. The useful lives are reviewed by management periodically and revised, if appropriate. In case of a revision, the unamortised depreciable amount is charged over the remaining useful life of the assets. In case of certain mining rights the amortisation is based on the extracted quantity to the total mineral reserve.\n\n## (ii) Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities:\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for deductible temporary di/fferences and unused tax losses for which there is probability of utilisation against the future taxable pro/uniFB01t. The Group uses judgement to determine the amount of deferred tax liability / asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and the level of future taxable pro/uniFB01ts and business developments.\n\n## (iii)  Fair value measurement of /uniFB01nancial instruments:\n\nWhen the fair values of /uniFB01nancial assets and /uniFB01nancial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using valuation techniques including the Discounted\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## (vii)  Litigation and contingencies:\n\nThe Group has ongoing litigations with various regulatory authorities. Where an out/uniFB02ow of funds is believed to be probable and a reliable estimate of the outcome of the dispute can be made based on management's assessment of speci/uniFB01c circumstances of each dispute and relevant external advice, management provides for its best estimate of the liability. Such accruals are by nature complex and can take number of years to resolve and can involve estimation uncertainty. Information about such litigations is provided in notes to the /uniFB01nancial statements.\n\n## (viii) Business Combination:\n\n## (a)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Fair Valuation of Intangibles: Mining Rights:\n\nThe Group has used royalty saved method for value analysis of limestone mining rights. The method estimates the value of future savings in royalty payments over the life of the mine accruing to the Group, by virtue of the transaction instead of obtaining the mining rights via the Government e-auction process.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /uniFB02ows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk of achieving the mine's projected savings.\n\n## Brand:\n\nThe Group has used relief from royalty method for value analysis of Brand. The method estimates the value as the present value of the after-tax projected revenues cash /uniFB02ows attributable to the Brand value.\n\nThe resulting post-tax cash /uniFB02ows for each of the years are recognised at their present value using a Weighted Average Cost of Capital ('WACC') relating to the risk associated with the Brand Name, which is higher than the overall business.\n\n## Fair Valuation of Tangibles:\n\n## Freehold land:\n\nFreehold land was valued using the sales comparison method using prevailing rates of\n\nCash Flow model. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgement is required in establishing fair values. Judgements include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility.\n\n## (iv)  De/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t plans:\n\nThe cost of the de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t gratuity plan, provident fund and other post-employment medical bene/uniFB01ts and the present value of the gratuity and provident fund obligation are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may di/ffer from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, a de/uniFB01ned bene/uniFB01t obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.\n\n## (v) Mines Restoration Obligation:\n\nIn determining the fair value of the Mines Restoration Obligation, assumptions and estimates are made in relation to discount rates, the expected cost of mines restoration and the expected timing of those costs.\n\n## (vi)  Share-based payments:\n\nThe Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions and cash settled transactions with employees using either Black-Scholes model or binomial tree model to determine the fair value of the liability incurred on the grant date. Estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions requires determination of the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms and conditions of the grant.\n\nThis estimate also requires determination of the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.\n\nThe assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in Note 50.",

In the case of buildings in cement plants, appropriate weightages have been applied to cement, iron & steel and labour indices to arrive at the escalation factor and depreciating the same for past usage based on estimated total and remaining useful life of the asset.\n\n## (ix)  Disposal Groups:\n\nThe Group has used comparable market multiple approach to assess the fair value of the disposal group.\n\nUnder the market multiple approach, enterprise value of a company is determined by using multiples derived from valuations of comparable companies, as manifested through stock market valuations of listed companies considering Enterprise Value/ Revenue and Enterprise value/ EBITDA multiples based on their market price and latest published /uniFB01nancial information.\n\nAppropriate adjustments are made (e.g. for debt and surplus assets) to arrive at the equity value of the disposal group.\n\n## Judgement:\n\n## Classi/uniFB01cation of Lease Ind AS 116:\n\nInd AS 116 Leases requires a lessee to determine the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease adjusted with any option to extend or terminate the lease, if the use of such option is reasonably certain. The Group makes an assessment on the expected lease term on lease by lease basis and thereby assesses whether it is reasonably certain that any options to extend or terminate the contract will be exercised. In evaluating the lease term, the Group considers factors such as any signi/uniFB01cant leasehold improvements undertaken over the lease term, costs relating to the termination of lease and the importance of the underlying lease to the Group's operations taking into account the location of the underlying asset and the availability of the suitable alternatives. The lease term in future periods is reassessed to ensure that the lease term re/uniFB02ects the current economic circumstances. The discount rate is generally based on the incremental borrowing rate speci/uniFB01c to the lease being evaluated or for a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics.",

CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually.\n\nPotential impairment is identi/uniFB01ed by comparing the recoverable value of a CGU to its carrying value. The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use. Value in use has been determined based on future cash /uniFB02ows, after considering current economic conditions, industry trends, estimated future operating results, growth rates and anticipated future economic conditions. As at March 31, 2024, the estimated cash /uniFB02ows for a period of 5 years were developed using internal forecasts, and a weighted average cost of capital of ~12% (March 31, 2023: ~ 12%). The cash /uniFB02ows beyond 5 years have been extrapolated assuming nil long-term growth rates.

It is utilised in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to issue bonus shares, to provide for premium on redemption of shares or debentures, equity related expenses like underwriting costs, etc.\n- c) Debenture Redemption Reserve (DRR): The Company has issued redeemable non-convertible debentures. Accordingly, the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 (as amended), requires the company to create DRR out of pro/uniFB01ts of the company available for payment of dividend. DRR is required to be created for an amount which is equal to 25% of the value of debentures issued. However, this requirement is no more applicable w.e.f. April 1, 2018 as per the amendment in the Companies (Share capital and Debentures) Rules, 2014 vide dated August 16, 2019; accordingly the Company has not made any new addition in the said reserve and accounted the reversal of outstanding reserve linked to payment of speci/uniFB01c non-convertible debentures.\n- d) General reserve: The Company has transferred a portion of the net pro/uniFB01t of the Company before declaring dividend to general reserve pursuant to the earlier provision of Companies Act, 1956. Mandatory transfer to general reserve is not required under the Act.\n- e) Shares Options Outstanding Reserve: The Company has three share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Company's shares have been granted to certain executives and senior employees. The share-based payment reserve is used to recognise the value of equity-settled share-based payments provided to employees, including key management personnel, as part of their remuneration.\n- f) Treasury Shares : The Company has formed an Employee Welfare Trust for purchasing Company's shares to be allotted to eligible employees under Employees Stock Options Scheme, 2018 (ESOS 2018). As per Ind AS 32 - Financial Instruments: Presentation, Reacquired equity shares of the Company are called Treasury Shares and deducted from equity.\n- g) Cash/uniFB02ow Hedge Reserve: The Company has designated its hedging instruments as cash /uniFB02ow hedges and any e/ffective portion of cash/uniFB02ow hedge is maintained in the said reserve. In case the hedging becomes ine/ffective, the amount is recognised to the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t and Loss.",

The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the entity. The /uniFB01nancial statements of subsidiaries are included in these consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements from the date on which controls commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\n## (ii) Non-controlling interest (NCI)\n\nNCI are measured at their proportionate share of the acquiree's net fair value of identi/uniFB01able assets at the date of acquisition. Changes in the Group's equity interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.\n\n## (iii) Loss of control\n\nWhen the Company loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognizes the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, and any related NCI and other components of equity. Any interest retained in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value at the date the control is lost. Any resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss.\n\n## (iv) Equity accounted investees\n\nThe Group's interests in equity accounted investees comprise interest in associates and joint venture.\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has signi/uniFB01cant in/uniFB02uence, but not control or joint control, over the /uniFB01nancial and operating policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control and has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities.\n\nInterests in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using equity method. They are initially recognized at cost which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements include the Group's share of pro/uniFB01t or loss and OCI of equity accounted investees until the date on which signi/uniFB01cant in/uniFB02uence or joint control ceases.\n\n## (v) Transactions eliminated on consolidation\n\nThe /uniFB01nancial statements of the Company, its Subsidiaries, Joint Venture and Associates used in the consolidation procedure are drawn upto the same reporting date i.e. March 31, 2024.\n\nThe consolidated /uniFB01nancial statements of the Group and its subsidiary companies are combined on a line-by-line basis by adding together the book values of like items of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealized income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated. Unrealized losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

There have been no changes from the previous periods in the methods and assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analyses.\n- @ The plan does not invest directly in any property occupied by the Group nor in any /uniFB01nancial securities issued by the Group.\n\n## (xii)  Discount Rate:\n\nThe discount rate is based on the prevailing market rates of Indian government securities for the estimated term of obligations.\n\n## (xiii) Salary Escalation Rate:\n\nThe estimates of future salary increases are considered taking into account in/uniFB02ation, seniority, promotion and other relevant factors.\n\n## (xiv)  Asset Liability matching strategy:\n\nThe money contributed by the Group to the Gratuity fund to /uniFB01nance the liabilities of the plan has to be invested.\n\nThe trustees of the plan have outsourced the investment management of the fund to an insurance Company. The insurance Company in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to them by the trustees and the asset allocation which is within the permissible limits prescribed in the insurance regulations. Due to the restrictions in the type of investments that can be held by the fund, it is not possible to explicitly follow an asset liability matching strategy.\n\nThere is no compulsion on the part of the Group to fully prefund the liability of the Plan. The Group's philosophy is to fund these bene/uniFB01ts based on its own liquidity and the level of underfunding of the plan.\n\n- (xv) The Group's expected contribution during next year is ' 1.94 Crores.

Fair Value Measurements (Ind AS 113):\n\nThe fair values of the /uniFB01nancial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at measurement date under the current market condition regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using other valuation techniques.\n\nThe Group has established the following fair value hierarchy that categorizes the values into 3 levels. The inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value of /uniFB01nancial instruments are:\n\nLevel 1: This hierarchy uses quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The fair value of all bonds which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price or dealer quotations as at the reporting date.\n\nLevel 2:\n\nThe fair value of /uniFB01nancial instruments that are not traded in an active market (For example traded bonds, over the counter derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques which maximize the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on company speci/uniFB01c estimates. The mutual fund units are valued using the closing Net Asset Value. If all signi/uniFB01cant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.\n\nLevel 3: If one or more of the signi/uniFB01cant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.",

The main purpose of these /uniFB01nancial liabilities is to /uniFB01nance the Group's operations. The Group's principal /uniFB01nancial assets, other than derivatives include trade and other receivables, investments and cash and cash equivalents that derive directly from its operations.\n\nThe Group's activities expose it to market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk. The Group's overall risk management focuses on the unpredictability of /uniFB01nancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse e/ffects on the /uniFB01nancial performance of the group. The group uses derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign currency option contracts, principal only swaps, cross currency swaps that are entered to hedge foreign currency risk exposure, interest rate swaps, coupon only swaps to hedge variable interest rate exposure and commodity /uniFB01xed price swaps to hedge commodity price risks. Derivatives are used exclusively for hedging purposes and not as trading or speculative instruments.\n\n## The several sources of risks which the Group is exposed to and their management are given below:\n\n| Risk            | Risk                         | Exposure Arising From                                                                             | Management                                                                                               | Measurement                                                                                                                                                                        |\n|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| I)  Market Risk | I)  Market Risk              | I)  Market Risk                                                                                   | I)  Market Risk                                                                                          | I)  Market Risk                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|                 | A)   Foreign  Currency  Risk | Committed commercial  transaction Financial asset and Liabilities not                             | (a)  Forward foreign exchange contracts (b)  Foreign currency options (c)  Principal only/Currency swaps | Cash Flow Forecasting Sensitivity Analysis                                                                                                                                         |\n|                 | B)   Interest Rate  Risk     | Long Term Borrowings at variable  rates                                                           | (a)  Interest Rate swaps, Coupon Only swaps                                                              | Sensitivity Analysis,  Interest rate movements (b)  Portfolio Diversi/uniFB01cation                                                                                                |\n|                 | C)   Commodity  Risk         | Movement in prices of  commodities mainly Imported  Thermal Coal and Pet Coke                     | (a)  Commodity Fixed Prices                                                                              | Sensitivity Analysis,  Commodity price  tracking (b)  Swaps/Options                                                                                                                |\n| II)             | Credit Risk                  | Trade receivables, Investments,  Derivative /uniFB01nancial instruments,  Loans and Bank balances |                                                                                                          | Ageing analysis, Credit  Rating (a)  Diversi/uniFB01cation of mutual fund investments,  (b)  Credit limit & credit worthiness   monitoring,  (c)  Criteria based approval  process |\n| III)            | Liquidity Risks              | Borrowings and Other Liabilities  and Liquid Investments                                          |                                                                                                          | Rolling cash /uniFB02ow  forecasts Broker Quotes (a)  Adequate unused credit lines and  borrowing facilities (b)  Portfolio Diversi/uniFB01cation                                  |",

It also updates the Risk Management Committee of the Group on periodical basis about the various risks to the business and status of various activities planned to mitigate the risks.\n\n## (I) Market Risk:\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss of future earnings, fair values or future cash /uniFB02ows that may result from a change in the price of a /uniFB01nancial instrument. The value of a /uniFB01nancial instrument may change as a result of changes in the interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices and other market changes that a/ffect market risk sensitive instruments. Market risk is attributable to all market risk sensitive /uniFB01nancial instruments including investments and deposits, foreign currency receivables, payables and borrowings.\n\n## A) Foreign Currency Risk:\n\nForeign currency risk is the risk of impact related to fair value or future cash /uniFB02ows of an exposure in foreign currency, which /uniFB02uctuate due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to the foreign currency borrowings, import of fuels, raw materials & spare parts, capital expenditure, exports of cement and the Company's net investments in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWhen a derivative is entered into for the purpose of being a hedge, the Company negotiates the terms of those derivatives to match the terms of the hedged exposure.\n\nThe Company evaluates exchange rate exposure arising from foreign currency transactions. The Company follows established risk management policies and standard operating procedures. It uses derivative instruments like foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk.\n\n| Outstanding foreign currency exposure (Gross) as at   | March 31, 2024   | March 31, 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|\n| Trade Receivables                                     |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 0.45             | 0.41             |\n| Trade Payables                                        |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 40.61            | 37.91            |\n| Euro                                                  | 0.15             | 0.40             |\n| Others                                                | -                | 0.15             |\n| Borrowings                                            |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 69.00            | 50.00            |\n| Investments                                           |                  |                  |\n| USD                                                   | 20.92            | 34.92            |\n| LKR                                                   | 0.65             | 0.65             |\n\n## Foreign currency sensitivity on unhedged exposure:\n\n100 bps increase in foreign exchange rates will have the following impact on pro/uniFB01t before tax.\n\n| Particulars   |   As at   March 31, 2024 | '  in Crores As at   March 31, 2023   |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| USD           |                     0.23 | (4.17)                                |\n| LKR           |                     0.02 | 0.03                                  |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps pro/uniFB01t will decrease by an equal amount.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## B) Interest rate risk:\n\nInterest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash /uniFB02ows of a /uniFB01nancial instrument will /uniFB02uctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group's exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group's short term borrowing (excluding commercial paper) with /uniFB02oating interest rates. For all long-term borrowings with /uniFB02oating rates, the risk of variation in the interest rates is mitigated through interest rate swaps. The Group constantly monitors the credit markets and rebalances its /uniFB01nancing strategies to achieve an optimal maturity pro/uniFB01le and /uniFB01nancing cost.\n\n## Interest rate exposure\n\n| Particulars                | Total borrowings   | Floating rate  borrowings   | Fixed rate  borrowings   | '  in Crores Non-Interest  bearing  borrowings   |\n|----------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| INR - Borrowings           | 4,334.10           | 240.00                      | 3,824.38                 | 269.72                                           |\n| USD - Borrowings           | 5,964.29           | 2,211.06                    | 3,753.23                 | -                                                |\n| Total as at March 31, 2024 | 10,298.39          | 2,451.06                    | 7,577.61                 | 269.72                                           |\n| INR - Borrowings           | 5,463.54           | 240.00                      | 4,908.55                 | 314.99                                           |\n| USD - Borrowings           | 4,437.24           | 1,150.44                    | 3,286.80                 | -                                                |\n| Total as at March 31, 2023 | 9,900.78           | 1,390.44                    | 8,195.35                 | 314.99                                           |\n\nNote: Interest rate risk hedged for foreign currency borrowings has been shown under Fixed Rate borrowings.\n\n## Interest rate sensitivities for unhedged exposure (impact on pro/uniFB01t before tax and equity due to increase in 100 bps):\n\n| Particulars   | As at   March 31, 2024   | '  in Crores As at   March 31, 2023   |\n|---------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| INR           | (2.40)                   | (2.40)                                |\n| USD           | (22.11)                  | (11.50)                               |\n\nNote: If the rate is decreased by 100 bps pro/uniFB01t will increase by an equal amount.\n\nInterest rate sensitivity has been calculated assuming the borrowings outstanding at reporting date have been outstanding for the entire reporting period.\n\n## Foreign Currency and Interest Rate Risk Management:\n\n## Forward Exchange and Interest Rates Swaps Contracts:\n\n## (a) Derivatives for hedging currency and interest rates, outstanding are as under:\n\n| Particulars   | Particulars                                 | Hedged item   | Currency   | As at   March 31, 2024   | As at   March 31, 2023   | '  in Crores Cross  Currency   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|\n| a.            | Forward Contracts                           | Imports       | USD        | 53.85                    | 37.73                    | INR                            |\n|               |                                             | Imports       | CNH        | 4.46                     | -                        | USD                            |\n|               |                                             | Imports       | Euro       | 3.13                     | 4.35                     | USD                            |\n|               |                                             | Imports       | JPY        | 5.04                     | 5.63                     | USD                            |\n|               |                                             | Investment    | USD        | 30.50                    | 28.80                    | INR                            |\n|               |                                             | Investment    | AED        | 111.96                   | 105.61                   | USD                            |\n| b.            | Options                                     | Imports       | USD        | 1.41                     | 16.50                    | INR                            |\n| c.            | Other Derivatives:                          |               |            |                          |                          |                                |\n|               | i.

This derivative is being used to hedge the Group's exposure to AED foreign exchange risk on these investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to OCI to o/ffset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the subsidiaries. There is no ine/ffectiveness during the year ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThere is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the net investment creates a translation risk that will match the foreign exchange risk on the forward contracts.\n\n| Particulars                                                        | March 31, 2024            | March 31, 2023            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|\n| Currency exchange risk hedged                                      | AED to INR                | AED to INR                |\n| Nominal amount of hedging instruments                              | AED 1,120.31 Mn           | AED 1,056.09 Mn           |\n| Maturity date                                                      | March 2025 to  March 2033 | March 2024 to  March 2033 |\n| Carrying value of hedging instruments (Derivative Assets)          | ' 27.51 Cr                | ' 2.21 Cr                 |\n| Change in the fair value of the hedging instrument during the year | ' 27.51 Cr                | ' 2.21 Cr                 |\n| Fair value gain on e/ffective hedge                                | ' 27.51 Cr                | ' 2.21 Cr                 |\n\nThe hedging gain recognised in OCI before tax is equal to the change in fair value used for measuring e/ffectiveness. There is no ine/ffectiveness recognised in the Statement of Pro/uniFB01t or Loss.\n\n## (D)  Commodity price risk management:\n\nCommodity price risk for the Company is mainly related to /uniFB02uctuations in coal and pet coke prices linked to various external factors, which can a/ffect the production cost of the Company. Since the Energy costs is one of the primary costs drivers, any /uniFB02uctuation in fuel prices can lead to drop in operating margin. To manage this risk, the Company enters into forward covers for imported coal, enter into long-term supply agreement for pet coke, identifying new sources of supply etc. While forward covers are prevailing in the markets for coal but in case of pet coke no such derivative is available; it has to be procured at spot prices. Additionally, processes and policies related to such risks are reviewed and controlled by senior management and fuel requirement are monitored by the central procurement team.\n\n## (II) Credit Risk Management:\n\nCredit risk arises when a customer or counterparty does not meet its obligations under a /uniFB01nancial instrument or customer contract, leading to a /uniFB01nancial loss. The Group is exposed to credit risk from its operating activities (primarily trade receivables) and from its /uniFB01nancing / investing activities, including deposits with banks//uniFB01nancial institutions, mutual fund investments, and investments in debt securities, foreign exchange transactions and /uniFB01nancial guarantees. The Group has no signi/uniFB01cant concentration of credit risk with any counterparty.",
