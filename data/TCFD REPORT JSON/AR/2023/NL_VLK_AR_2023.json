We report on our financial performance, our activities during the year to support our purpose and strategy, and our risk management and governance.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis document is only a website version and is not the official annual report, including the audited financial statements thereto pursuant to article 361 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. The official annual report, including the audited financial statements and the auditor's opinion thereof, are included in the single report package which can be found via https:// www.vanlanschotkempen.com/annual-report-2023-xbrl.\n\nIn case of any discrepancies between the website version and the annual report package, the annual report package will prevail.\n\nNote that the auditor's opinion included in the website version does not relate to the website version but only to the official annual report. No rights can be derived from using the website version, including the unofficial copy of the auditor's opinion. Our auditors did not determine (nor do they need to) that the website version is identical to the official version.\n\n## Changes to our reporting segments\n\nStarting in 2024, we will manage our business and report on our results according to four client segments. We therefore made some organisational changes during the second half of 2023. In this annual report, when discussing figures or developments in 2023, we use the previous client segments: Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Investment Banking Clients. When discussing our strategies and targets going forward, we use the new client segments: Private Clients Netherlands, Private Clients Belgium, Investment Management Clients and Investment Banking Clients.\n\n## Acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform\n\nAt the beginning of July 2023, the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform was completed. We applied the acquisition method as prescribed by IFRS 3 Business Combinations, under which the client relationships, brand name and application software were recognised and measured as identifiable assets acquired. The difference between the paid consideration and the identifiable assets was recognised as goodwill. We have included the July-December 2023 figures for this activity in Van Lanschot Kempen's 2023 figures.\n\n## Disclosure of Non-Financial Information Act\n\nThe EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (NFRD) and the Dutch Disclosure of Non-Financial Information Act made reporting on a number of non-financial themes compulsory for companies that qualify as large public-interest entities ( grote organisaties van openbaar belang ) with more than 500 employees. These themes comprise environmental, social and governance issues, as well as anti-corruption, bribery, human and labour rights. For each of these themes, companies are obliged to report on the relevant policies, results, risks (including the management of these risks) and non-financial key\n\nperformance indicators. In addition, the regulation requires companies to describe their business models and to disclose information on their EU taxonomy alignment and eligibility in their annual reports. For more information, see \"Our EU taxonomy alignment and eligibility\" on page 81. Our sustainability supplement includes a reference table to help the reader find the disclosures prescribed by the NFRD and the Dutch Disclosure of Non-Financial Information Act.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative\n\nOur annual report has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards. For further details, see the GRI content index on our website:\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/sustainability/ reporting-and-regulation.\n\nFor more information about how we report on tax in accordance with GRI 207: Tax, see our 2023 tax transparency report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.\n\n## International Integrated Reporting Framework\n\nIn addition to the GRI Standards, we aim to apply the fundamental concepts and guiding principles of the International Integrated Reporting Framework. This annual report employs various elements of the framework, such as our value creation model and materiality matrix, and is partly structured around the types of capital identified by the framework (financial, manufactured, human, natural and social capital). For more information, see: integratedreporting.org/ resource/international-ir-framework.\n\n## External assessment\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's sustainability performance is assessed by a variety of external organisations. For more information, see our rankings and ratings on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/sustainability/ rankings-and-ratings.\n\n## Unrounded figures\n\nAmounts in the annual report may not add up due to being rounded up or down. The total amounts may therefore deviate from the sum of the parts. Percentage changes are based on the unrounded figures.\n\n## Changes to comparative figures\n\nSome amounts may differ from previously published reports; in these cases, explanations are given in the footnotes.",

And we track our progress on our strategy according to a number of key performance indicators (KPIs).\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Our purpose\n\nOur purpose is to preserve and create wealth for our clients and for society in a sustainable way. We build close relationships with our clients so that we can guide them in their financial decisions. Only by putting ourselves in their shoes can we use our collective expertise to present them with fitting solutions and products in support of their longterm goals.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands, with a heritage dating back almost 300 years. We couple long-standing relationships with a talent for staying one step ahead. That's what makes Van Lanschot Kempen unique: across generations, we've acted decisively and proactively to help our clients move onwards - with a personal and entrepreneurial approach, grounded in clear investment principles. We manage, invest and advise on behalf of the individuals, families and organisations we serve. This is what we aim to capture in our core promise - Onwards together ( Kom verder ) - which applies both to our clients and to each other.\n\nWe are an independent, well-capitalised wealth manager with a banking licence. We have a strong specialist position in our chosen markets, combining private banking, investment management and investment banking. We believe our knowledge, experience and personal approach, coupled with our unique combination of activities, are what set us apart.\n\n## Our values\n\nOur values act as a compass that guides us to make choices in our actions: in how we work together, implement our strategy and foster a diverse and inclusive working environment. These values emerged from interviews with employees across the different client segments as well as business and support teams. They were validated by clients and we discussed them - and the behaviour underlying them - with colleagues throughout the company.\n\nWe subscribe to four shared values:\n\n- -Personal : We invest in building long-term relationships. We're driven by our clients' interests. We're proactive on their behalf. And our personal approach to the way we work with our clients also extends to the way we work with each other.\n- -Specialised : We love our craft. We work together with in-depth knowledge of specific sectors and disciplines. We're resourceful. We set the bar for quality high. And we aim to continuously learn and improve.\n- -Entrepreneurial : We're ambitious and results-focused. We anticipate and see opportunities - always aligned with the interests and goals of our clients. We believe in sustainable solutions. And we actively look for investments and initiatives that contribute to these.\n- -Decisive : We serve our clients, colleagues and stakeholders best by taking decisive action, tackling tough situations head-on. We take a solutions-oriented approach. We're clear in our advice and our service offering. And we do what we say we're going to do.\n\n## Our code of conduct\n\nIn 2023, we updated our code of conduct. It sets out what we consider the essence of ethical behaviour and what we hold ourselves accountable for, both individually and collectively. During the process, we consulted with clients, employees, shareholders and the Works Council in order to take their input into account.\n\nOur code of conduct is not an exhaustive list of rules, but rather a set of commitments underpinned by three ethical principles:\n\n- -We are respectful towards others\n- -We act with discretion\n- -We think across generations\n\nOur ethical principles give direction to our behaviour and align with our values. Read our full code of conduct on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/ who-we-are/compliance.\n\n## Our investment principles\n\nAs a wealth manager, investing is at the core of what we do. A long-term approach such as ours requires both vision and discipline. Which is why our investment engine is active and engaged, investing time in truly understanding what we own. We follow a set of three investment principles in everything we do. Be it picking individual securities, investment managers or investment building blocks:\n\n- -Strong unique selling point (USP)\n- -Clear focus\n- -Alignment of interests\n\nWe invest in companies and strategies that have a strong and unique competitive position in their markets. We back leaders with a clear vision that they implement in a focused way. And we look for leadership teams that have skin in the game via share ownership and appropriate incentivisation. We start from our clients' wishes, and act upon these based on our investment principles.\n\n## Our client groups and activities\n\nWe combine our private banking activities with in-house investment management products and solutions, and investment banking expertise. We work together across the different segments of our business in order to provide more relevant solutions to clients and to find synergies.\n\nWe have a clear focus on our client groups - and those we wish to attract. These include private clients, such as wealthy and mass-affluent individuals, entrepreneurs, business professionals, executives, foundations and associations; wholesale and institutional clients, such as pension funds, insurance companies and other (retail) banks; and investment banking clients in our focus sectors (European real estate, life sciences & healthcare, tech & fintech and infrastructure & renewables).\n\nWe are active in several geographies: private banking in the Netherlands, Belgium and Switzerland; investment management in the Netherlands, the UK and western Europe; and investment banking in western Europe and the US.",

        "page_content": "## Our strategy\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent, wellcapitalised wealth manager that delivers consistent growth, with a strong specialist position in the market and a long heritage. We believe that our knowledge and experience, our personal, client-focused approach and our unique combination of activities set us apart from our competitors in our selected market segments, while offering growth opportunities.\n\n## Our strategic ambition\n\nWe aim to be the best wealth manager in western Europe, with leading positions in the Netherlands and Belgium. We plan to achieve this by growing our business in a scalable way, by offering distinctive solutions to our clients and by being the best in our chosen niches.\n\nOur ambition is to grow our assets under management (AuM) by around 10% a year on average - reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We want our organisation to be large enough to handle technology and regulations efficiently, while small enough to be nimble and remain close to clients.\n\nTo offer distinctive solutions to our clients, we focus on combining the strengths of our activities: private banking, investment management and investment banking. We pursue a solutions-led approach, building on client needs and market developments. Synergies are achieved through offering the full range of services and products from our specialists across our different activities. We aim to be the best in our chosen niches, which requires us to make clear choices in terms of what we do and don't offer.\n\n## Our strategic pillars\n\nIn delivering on our ambitions, we focus on five strategic pillars:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Accelerate growth organically and inorganically\n\nWe continue to deliver on our wealth management strategy, by focusing on scalable growth while maintaining a capitallight balance sheet. To remain relevant for our clients and accelerate our organic AuM growth, we focus on growing the company from within, in a sustainable way. We leverage our existing relationships, skills and knowledge to anticipate our clients' needs with solutions that stand out in the market.\n\nInorganic AuM growth is also part of our strategy: we focus on potential bolt-on acquisitions in the Dutch and Belgian private banking space, and in investment management in the Netherlands.\n\n## Advance through digitalisation and advanced analytics\n\nChanges in clients' needs and economic developments require us to respond quickly. Technology and digitalisation allow us to improve our productivity and service by speeding up processes, reducing operational errors and improving the availability, quality and interpretation of data. We continue to invest in technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), to increase efficiency and develop innovative solutions.\n\nTechnology is an integral part of how we provide service to our clients, while continuing to maintain a personal touch. For example, we use technology to ensure that our communications are as individually tailored as possible - by providing our bankers with access to clear dashboards, enabling them to monitor their clients' portfolios, so that they can contact clients at the right time with the right information.\n\n## Achieve our sustainability ambitions\n\nThe world around us is changing - demanding fundamental transitions in how we consume energy and food. We're focused on helping our clients navigate these transitions, with an active, engaged approach based on our investment principles. While both transitions are equally important, our primary focus right now is the energy transition and the vital shift towards a low-carbon economy, while our secondary focus is the food transition and promoting biodiversity.\n\nBeing a wealth manager with a long-term focus means that we proactively strive to prevent negative consequences for stakeholders, while aiming to create positive long-term financial and non-financial value. We can achieve the most significant social and environmental impact via our client investments, but we also aim to lead by example by reducing our own carbon footprint.\n\n## Act as one to leverage our full potential\n\nIn order to unlock the full potential of our organisation for our clients, we must be able to offer solutions that build on the knowledge and expertise of the entire group as well as our open architecture platform. We collaborate across our various client segments in order to offer unique, relevant solutions and promote cross-referrals. For example, private clients can benefit from our debt advisory services while entrepreneurs selling their businesses can be referred to our bankers for wealth management services.",

Talent retention within our company is becoming more and more important. We focus on keeping our employees engaged, ensuring flexible and inclusive working conditions, offering professional development and throughflow opportunities, and promoting inclusion and diversity.\n\n## Steering and monitoring our business in 2023\n\nIn order to monitor whether we're making progress on delivering on our ambitions and creating long-term value, we define financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs) and targets. These are based on industry trends and developments, stakeholder expectations, client needs and strategic relevance. The material topics that were used as inputs for these KPIs can be found in our sustainability supplement.\n\nOur KPIs are focused on value creation themes, both financial and non-financial.

        "page_content": "## The world around us in 2023\n\nThe reporting year 2023 continued to be tumultuous, with several dynamics - political, humanitarian, economic, environmental and technological - affecting individuals, society and financial markets. The latter offered anything but a quiet ride, but the year ended strongly, with US and European stock markets close to all-time highs. While there were many developments in 2023, the topics below were top of mind for many of our clients.\n\n## Geopolitics: global uncertainty\n\nWhen Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, it came as a shock to many. By 2023, it had become apparent that the conflict between Russia and Ukraine was not going to end quickly. Meanwhile, war broke out between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, resulting in severe human suffering.\n\nWhile all of this has had disastrous consequences for those directly involved, the impacts have been felt globally as geopolitical uncertainty continued - affecting the international economy as well as investment options for clients. At the same time, global powers such as the US and China have continued to exert a degree of protectionism.\n\n## National politics: policy changes\n\nThe outcome of the general election that took place in the Netherlands in November 2023 may lead to shifts in fiscal, climate and other policies that impact family businesses in particular. According to a 2023 survey by Nyenrode Business University, RSM and Van Lanschot Kempen, top of mind for family businesses are proposed alterations to the business succession scheme ( bedrijfsopvolgingsregeling ) in terms of gift and inheritance taxes, as well as a general need for stability.\n\n## Technology: rise of artificial intelligence\n\nThe reporting year saw remarkable growth in naturallanguage processing and machine learning, exemplified by generative artificial intelligence (AI) models. Their widespread adoption by both companies and individuals underscored the increasing integration of AI into everyday life.\n\nFor society as a whole as well as for the financial sector, this brings both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, AI can support work processes and provide new insights. But at the same time, it poses threats relating to data security, confirmation bias and identity theft.\n\n## Sustainability: long-term transitions\n\nIn general over the last few years, we've seen awareness around climate change increasing. Many of our stakeholders - whether private or institutional clients, employees, shareholders, regulators or business partners - are preparing for (and struggling with) this issue. More and more companies have started to address this, by preparing for the major transitions to come - in energy and food in particular.\n\nThe need for this was again brought into focus in 2023, as the northern hemisphere experienced the hottest summer on record. Globally, there have been unprecedented levels of flooding, wildfires and other extreme climate change-related disasters.\n\nBoth private and institutional clients are increasingly looking for climate-resilient investment opportunities. The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) requires financial institutions to ask clients about their sustainability preferences and take them into account. This exercise is giving financial institutions - including Van Lanschot Kempen - insights into client wishes. The outcomes show that different clients are approaching this at a different pace.\n\n## Operating environment\n\n## High inflation, rising interest rates\n\nIn 2023, the inflation spike that was experienced the previous year translated into the rest of the economy. Food inflation has been particularly steep and is taking longer to dissipate than expected.\n\nIn the labour market, salaries have increased as well although not fully in line with inflation. So far, the labour market seems resilient, with no significant increase in unemployment rates. Equally, we've not seen a wave of corporate defaults among entrepreneurs. It remains to be seen whether this will change in 2024.\n\nAt the same time, key interest rates increased at an unprecedented pace across Europe over the course of the reporting year, which impacted our client groups in many different ways. Savings rates went up, with many private clients seeing an opportunity to benefit more by switching their asset allocations from savings to term deposits. Meanwhile, higher interest rates led to higher lending costs for home owners, while lending costs for entrepreneurs looking for financing also increased. And banks saw an increase in their interest income. In the investment banking market, we've seen fewer transactions globally; businesses still need to adjust to higher interest rates.\n\n## Test of the financial system\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, volatility in financial markets rose sharply, sparked by specific problems at several US and European banks, and accelerated by social media and mobile banking. In the end, the issue was confined to a few players after governments and central banks reacted swiftly to contain it. These events underlined the importance of sound risk management and solid liquidity buffers, while clients are looking for financial institutions with strong balance sheets.\n\n## Finalisation of pension reforms\n\nIn the Netherlands, the reporting year saw pension reforms move from the planning phase to the definitive phase. In July 2023, the new pension law ( Wet toekomst pensioenen ) came into effect, and must be implemented by 2028. The Netherlands now faces the challenge of a massive transition to its pension system, which will require individuals to assume more responsibilities.",

        "page_content": "There will be both more options for self-employed people to save for their pensions, and more flexibility for employed people to set aside money on top of the pension offered by their employer. The pension funds themselves clearly have a big task ahead of them: navigating this transition will mean changes to their pension schemes.\n\nIn Belgium, the federal government also reached an agreement on a new package of measures to improve the financial sustainability of the country's pension system.\n\nIn the UK, asset management has been consolidating for a number of years now. The drivers behind this are the derisking and simplification of investment strategies. However, the anticipated consolidation of the pensions sector was slower than expected in 2023. In its Autumn Statement, the British government announced a package of measures aimed at reforming the pensions market to unlock investment into high-growth sectors and generate increased returns for savers.\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nIn addition to the trends and developments that impact our operating environment, as a wealth manager we face specific risks associated with our sector. In 2023, we identified the following key risk themes:\n\n- -Interest rate risk: changing client behaviour in response to rising interest rates\n- -Operational risk: organisational complexity and change management\n- -Compliance risk: organisational culture and ethical behaviour\n- -Sustainability risk: climate change and regulation\n\nSee 'Risk and capital management' (page 65) for more details.",

        "page_content": "## Van Lanschot Kempen in 2023\n\nAmid fast-changing economic and geopolitical circumstances and climate events, our focus was first and foremost on being a steward for our clients. We put our combined expertise and network to work for them, with entrepreneurship and a long-term perspective. We invested in enhancing our solutions with personal and relevant services that are digitally convenient. At the same time, we strengthened our position as a specialist wealth manager.\n\n## Delivering on our strategic ambition\n\n## Our performance\n\nIn 2023, we continued to deliver on our wealth management strategy, by focusing on sustainable and profitable growth while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. We added 18% to our assets under management (AuM) in 2023, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance.\n\nNet inflow of \u20ac5.3 billion in AuM demonstrates the trust that existing and new private and institutional clients place in Van Lanschot Kempen. Our Private Clients segment recorded very strong net inflows of \u20ac2.3 billion. The Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment showed a total net inflow of \u20ac3.1 billion in 2023.\n\nOver recent years, we've successfully expanded our activities with several bolt-on acquisitions and partnerships. In the first half of 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen completed its accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. The company's integration with Van Lanschot Belgium was successfully completed by the end of 2023. And we were still able to grow, with net AuM inflows of \u20ac0.8 billion and total AuM working out at \u20ac11.3 billion.\n\nIn July 2023, we completed the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform, which merged with Evi van Lanschot to create a leading online investment platform in the Netherlands. The integration programme is expected to take around two years to complete.\n\nIn December 2023, we announced the intended acquisition of Belgian investment adviser Accuro: a further step in our growth strategy in Belgium as our second home market.\n\nIn terms of financial targets, our cost/income ratio stood at 71.6% at year-end 2023, against a target of 70%. Our capital position continued to be strong in 2023, while return on CET 1 amounted to 14.2%.\n\n## Combining the strength of our activities\n\nWe work together across different segments of our business to provide more relevant solutions to clients and to find further synergies. Acting as one allows us to benefit from our combined capabilities and strengthens our position as an independent, specialist wealth manager in western Europe.\n\nSupported by a new organisational structure, we've made responsibilities clearer so that we're better able to deliver value for our clients (see \"Our organisational structure\" on page 10). We have also increased our focus on targeted investment management products and strategies for the benefit of private clients, additional deal flows between private banking and investment banking, and throughflow of talent.\n\n## Achieving our sustainability ambitions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAt Van Lanschot Kempen, we see sustainability not only as an urgent need, but also as an unprecedented opportunity to create value over the long term. Because preserving and creating wealth for generations to come is only possible when we make sure that growth is both profitable and sustainable.\n\nWe're focused on helping our clients navigate the energy and food transitions, with an active, engaged approach based on our investment principles. Sustainability is therefore embedded throughout our solutions (see page 47). We have set clear targets and regularly report on our progress against them.\n\nWe can make the biggest impact via the wealth invested by our clients. At year-end 2023, the percentage of AuM in sustainable and impact investment solutions totalled 23.1%, compared with 20.6% at year-end 2022. We've made good strides within our own operations since 2019, having cut our own carbon emissions by 42% per FTE. In 2023, we set more ambitious targets to decrease our own carbon footprint and to reduce carbon emissions via our discretionary AuM, effective from 2024 onwards. For more information, see \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" on page 45.\n\nIn 2023, we also implemented the EU's sustainability regulations, such as the EU taxonomy, the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) and the amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II). Part of the implementation of these regulations involved developing a platform to make external sustainability data available for reporting purposes. In the future, we will use this data to provide our clients with more insights.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 for our clients\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Private Clients\n\nIn our Private Clients segment, our focus was on delivering an excellent client experience in both our discretionary management and advisory propositions. We're investing in generative artificial intelligence (AI) to increase efficiency, reduce costs and improve client service channels. By automating manual data processing, improving client communication and identifying more investment opportunities, we aim to streamline operations and provide personalised insights to clients.\n\n## Private Clients in the Netherlands\n\nIn the first half of 2023, we launched a new wealth management proposition that enables private banking clients in the Netherlands to tailor their discretionary management portfolios. Through this, we offer access to our institutional expertise and both in-house and third-party solutions. For instance, we enable clients to invest in our Global Impact Pool, Private Markets Fund, Non-Directional Partnership and Megatrends Fund. For more information, see our feature on page 91.\n\nClients expressed their continued interest in new alternative products within private markets. Having listened to their wishes, we launched our North American Private Equity Fund in October, focusing on small and medium-sized privately owned companies in North America.\n\nOur private clients continue to be satisfied with us, in terms of both the personal contact they receive and our digital and investment services. This is evidenced by a relationship Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 34 (2022: 36), exceeding our target of 20.\n\n## Private Clients in Belgium\n\nIn Belgium, we focused on integrating Mercier Vanderlinden with Van Lanschot Belgium. As of 1 January 2024, we continued as Mercier Van Lanschot: a new brand with a strong heritage, shared values and a distinctive offering for clients in our second home market. In the past year, we've strengthened our expertise and range of solutions, including by launching a fixed income fund offered to Belgian private investors. Clients also appreciate improved digital tools, including our new investment app, which optimises the user experience.\n\n## Evi van Lanschot\n\nIn the reporting year, we focused on the growth of Evi van Lanschot's online investment service, meeting the increasing demand for investment products that reflect the ongoing individualisation of the Dutch pensions market. We entered the intermediary market for pension investments by offering Evi van Lanschot's pension solutions to clients of independent financial advisers.\n\nIn July, following our acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform, Evi van Lanschot welcomed Robeco Retail's clients and employees, working together towards further growth of the online investment service. In December, Evi van Lanschot improved its savings proposition by offering an attractive savings rate and enabling former Robeco Retail clients to save money in their investment accounts once again.\n\nEvi van Lanschot's clients rated us with an NPS of 0 (2022: -1). In general, clients appreciate the investment app as well as our communications and service, but see room for improvement in their investment returns.\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nIn our fiduciary management business, we're well placed to act as a sparring partner in the overhaul of the Dutch pension system, based on our many years of experience in designing tailored investment portfolios for large groups of different ages. We understand the unique needs of large group schemes and have created investment mixes to meet those needs. In doing so, we help around 2.3 million pension scheme members in the Netherlands and the UK.\n\nIn 2023, we improved our proposition in illiquid investments. This was achieved primarily by strengthening our advisory services, especially for institutional clients. Within these alternative investment solutions, advising clients on the full range of illiquid investments is key. Our guidance extends beyond merely selecting the appropriate asset class. It also encompasses setting objectives, identifying relevant themes such as health and climate, defining KPIs and implementing strategies through various means - be it a mandate, a customised fund or a multi-client fund.\n\nSatisfaction levels among our wholesale and institutional clients are high. Our NPS decreased from 38 in 2021 to 30 in 2023, but exceeded our target of 20. Clients appreciate our dedicated and approachable team, along with our highquality service.\n\n## Improvement programme\n\nIn 2023, we launched a range of initiatives focused on profitable growth in our Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, with an enhanced strategy. Our focus is on efficiently setting up the organisation and systems, while we are investing in our commercial strength - for instance, through extensive sales training courses. At the same time, we enhanced our digital service for clients by providing even better content on sustainable investing and private markets, expanding our client portal, and offering direct access to internal research. Moreover, we aim to achieve further business efficiency improvements by leveraging data-driven decision-making and generative AI solutions in areas where large information sets need to be interpreted.",

        "page_content": "## Investment Banking Clients\n\nWithin investment banking, we and our clients experienced a difficult year, shaped by the challenging market conditions affecting corporate finance and capital markets transactions. Global transaction volumes were significantly lower in 2023, especially for our real estate clients, as these clients needed to regain their footing and adjust to higher interest rates. In response, we adapted the organisation to market circumstances, focusing on costs, appropriate staff levels and training, in anticipation of growth in 2024. Amid subdued activity, our team remained in close contact with our clients, ready to offer advice. Other parts of the business, such as life sciences & healthcare, infrastructure & renewables and debt advisory, have grown year-on-year.\n\nWe also further strengthened the collaboration between our Private Clients segment and Investment Banking Clients segment - for example, by providing corporate finance and strategic advice to entrepreneurs and family offices. In 2023, we launched a Sustainable Opportunities team, offering comprehensive investment research on companies and industries driving the transition to a sustainable future.\n\n## 2023 for our employees\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFollowing a significant recruitment drive over recent years to strengthen our digital, compliance and commercial teams in particular, in 2023 our focus shifted to retention. We aim to provide relevant development opportunities as well as attractive career tracks, and to ensure flexible and inclusive working conditions. To foster connection with the company, we offer employee share plans; we're proud that more than 70% of our employees are shareholders in Van Lanschot Kempen. Through our partnership programme, senior leaders have 0.8% ownership of our company. For more information, see \"Employee participation plans\" on page 88.\n\nIn addition to our regular trainee programmes, in 2023 we launched our Young Private Banking Programme: training our private bankers of the future. Ten highly motivated colleagues started the programme with the goal of growing into fully fledged private bankers or investment advisers in the next two years. They'll do this by learning on the job, with coaching on professional and personal development. For more information, read our feature on page 43.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we also engaged in dialogue around various aspects of our identity and culture, including our values, code of conduct and collaboration. We also talked about diversity, equity and inclusion, broadening our focus to include areas such as ethnicity in addition to gender. We will continue this dialogue in 2024.\n\nIn 2023, our Employer Net Promoter Score (eNPS) was 22, which well exceeds our target and improved on the 2022 score of 18. This is a strong outcome and shows that employees would recommend Van Lanschot Kempen as a good place to work.\n\n## 2023 for our shareholders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's growth and sustainability profile were highlighted by its inclusion in both the AMX Index and the AEX ESG Index. Our capital position remained strong in 2023, with a CET 1 ratio of 19.6% - well above our target of 15% plus an add-on of 2.5% for acquisitions. In June 2023, we paid out our 2022 dividend of \u20ac1.75 per share (totalling \u20ac74 million). In December 2023, we returned excess capital to shareholders of \u20ac2.00 per share (totalling \u20ac85 million).\n\n## Research on historical links to slavery\n\nThe history of Van Lanschot Kempen dates back to 1737: the Van Lanschot firm was founded in the city of 's Hertogenbosch as a trading house dealing mainly in colonial goods. In order to understand our past, in 2022 we commissioned an investigation into the possible involvement of our legal predecessors in slavery.\n\nIndependent research by the University of Leiden has shown that part of those colonial goods were produced using slave labour. The trading company purchased these goods at auctions and through business partners in the provinces of Holland and Zeeland, and subsequently sold them in 's Hertogenbosch and surrounding areas. According to the research, the legal predecessors of Van Lanschot Kempen were thus indirectly involved in slavery.\n\nIn 2023, we discussed the outcome of the research with several stakeholders and colleagues in particular, including the steps that we want to take subsequently. The participants in this dialogue indicated clearly that they wish to convert our awareness of our past into concrete and meaningful steps in the present and future, aimed at promoting inclusiveness, diversity and equal opportunities. In doing so, we focus on our own organisation, the companies we invest in and the society of which we are part.",

        "page_content": "## Our stakeholders\n\nOur purpose is to preserve and create wealth for our clients and for society in a sustainable way. We therefore take a long-term view. An essential part of this approach is an active, continuous dialogue with our stakeholders.\n\n## Our stakeholder groups\n\nOur various stakeholder groups have different expectations of Van Lanschot Kempen. The overview below 1 outlines our assessment of these expectations.\n\n## Clients\n\nExcellent client experience, strong personal relationships, holistic advice, tailored and relevant solutions, risk-rewarding returns, and safe and easy means of contact\n\n## Employees\n\nPersonal autonomy, inspiring leadership, personal and professional development, competitive salary and benefits, a professional and healthy (hybrid) working environment, an inclusive culture and a diverse workforce\n\n## Shareholders/bondholders\n\nSustainable and profitable growth, attractive returns and dividends, a solid business model, and management of the business in a sustainable way\n\n## Governments/regulators\n\nCompliance with laws and regulations (practices within the letter and spirit of the law), responsible payment of taxes, positive contribution to society and the environment, and contribution to financial stability\n\n## Business partners\n\nTimely payment and Van Lanschot Kempen's financial stability, clear and transparent communication, proactive collaboration and long-term partnerships\n\nWe value our relationships with all our stakeholders. We seek input and inspiration from various groups, including an advisory board. We aim to maintain an open dialogue, through stakeholder events and conversations on specific topics and themes such as culture and behaviour, diversity and inclusion, client-centricity, sustainability, technology and investment. The outcomes of these help shape our views and provide input for our strategic cycle.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nIn 2023, we launched our stakeholder engagement policy in line with the new Corporate Governance Code. The policy is available on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/ about-us/sustainability/governance-and-stakeholders.\n\n## Stakeholder dialogue\n\nDuring our annual stakeholder events, our management asks for input on specific strategic issues that we face as an organisation. The theme of our 2023 dialogue was biodiversity and the food transition.\n\nRead more about the 2023 event in our sustainability supplement and on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/ en-nl/about-us/sustainability/governance-andstakeholders/stakeholder-events.\n\nWe also engage with our stakeholders in other ways. For example, our client-facing teams nurture relationships with their clients; the Works Council represents employees; we maintain relationships with shareholders and analysts; we frequently engage with regulators; and we sustain relationships with banking supervisors.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has also participated in work streams and analyses prepared by financial sector associations such as the Dutch Fund and Asset Management Association (DUFAS), the Association of Securities-Issuing Companies (VEUO) and the Dutch Association of Tax Advisers (NOB). These activities help us assess the potential impact of new legislative packages on our business.\n\n## Materiality assessment\n\nWe conduct a materiality assessment every other year to identify our most significant impacts. The outcomes of the materiality assessment conducted in 2021 are outlined in our sustainability supplement. This 2021 materiality matrix formed the basis for our 2023 annual report.\n\nIn 2023, we conducted our most recent materiality assessment. This provided input when setting our key performance indicators (KPIs) for the 2024-25 period and will form the basis for non-financial reporting in our 2024 annual report. The new materiality matrix and overview of material topics can be found on the following two pages.\n\nCompared with our previous materiality matrix (which can be found in our sustainability supplement), the key difference is the introduction of double materiality, which recognises the interdependence between financial materiality and impact materiality. Double materiality considers both the financial impacts of environmental and social factors on a company, as well as the impacts of the company's activities on the environment and society. Another difference is the more granular breakdown of the natural and social impact of our solutions into topics such as \"alignment of business model and strategy with Paris Agreement\" and \"impact on workers in value chain via our assets under management (AuM)\".\n\n## The process to conduct our materiality assessment\n\n- -We started with a longlist of topics derived from our assessment in 2021 and other standards and publications.\n- -From this, we created a shortlist based on assessment of the impact we can make and financial materiality, conducted by in-house experts who also sought to specify where the actual or potential impact takes place. For each topic, we determined whether we (potentially) impact stakeholders through our own operations, our balance sheet and/or our AuM.\n- -Stakeholders were requested to assess the severity and likelihood of impacts our organisation could make on the shortlisted topics.",

In 2024, we plan to continue to grow in our private banking and investment management activities, while keeping a keen eye on costs and limiting new hires. In practice, this means:\n\n- -Private Clients Netherlands and Belgium: growing organically by offering the best service to our clients through personalised solutions, while gaining market share and looking out for potential bolt-on acquisitions;\n- -Investment Management Clients: meeting pension clients' needs in the pensions transition, leveraging our strengths by offering investment management products to our private clients, and maximising the effectiveness of our value chains in order to respond more quickly to client wishes;\n- -Investment Banking Clients: continuing to deliver value to our clients in our selected sectors within corporate finance, equity capital markets and debt advisory, while generating additional deal flows between Private Clients and Investment Banking Clients;\n- -Sustainability ambitions: continuing to focus on the energy transition (including reducing the carbon footprint of our own organisation), while generating better insights into how investee companies contribute to the food transition;\n- -Our people: expanding our inclusion and diversity focus to encompass more than gender, continuing to work on reducing the gender pay gap, supporting the flow of talent across the organisation, and ensuring attractive professional development opportunities and employment conditions.",

That's why, at Van Lanschot Kempen, value creation means generating sustainable, longterm returns and maintaining long-standing relationships with our clients.\n\n## How we create value\n\nWe create value in several ways - primarily via our clients' investments.\n\nFor our clients, we create value in the form of investment returns, by preserving and creating wealth. We also invest and help our clients to invest - in three types of solutions:\n\n- -Responsible : the client actively invests with a focus on avoiding harm.\n- -Sustainable : the client seeks sustainable investments with high standards for exclusion, active ownership and stakeholder benefits.\n- -Impact : the client aims to address global sustainability challenges by investing in companies that contribute to positive real-world outcomes.\n\nWe seek to act as a steward by helping our clients allocate their capital to organisations that are part of, or are well prepared for, the energy and/or food transitions.\n\nBy providing mortgages, we create value for clients by enabling home ownership. We also support them in making their homes more energy-efficient through our mortgage proposition.\n\nAs an employer, we create value for our employees through remuneration, the social value of having work and professional development opportunities.\n\nLast but not least, we aim to be a good corporate citizen by reducing the negative impact of our own organisation and aiming to make a positive impact on society.\n\n## Our value creation model\n\nOur value creation model on the following page provides a summary of our inputs, outputs and impact via five types of capital. The value creation tables and explanations in the five chapters that follow go into more detail about the data provided in the model.\n\n## Inputs and outputs\n\nAs a wealth manager, Van Lanschot Kempen attracts various types of capital as inputs. We aim to deploy these types of capital in combination for overall value creation - meaning that we strive to add value via our business model, thereby increasing the total capital. Outputs can be both positive and negative. Note that input via one form of capital may be transformed into output via another form of capital. For example, financial capital inputs may lead to investment returns or home ownership (manufactured capital).\n\n| Type of capital   | Inputs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Outputs                                                                                     |\n|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Financial         | The pool of funds  available to our  organisation with which  to run our operations stakeholders                                                                                                                                                    | The pool of funds that  we are able to  redistribute to our                                 |\n|                   | The money entrusted to  us by our various client  groups The accumulated  wealth of our clients  that has been invested  via our various products                                                                                                   | Manufactured                                                                                |\n|                   | our clients Our employees and  external parties, who  bring their knowledge  The hiring, training and  development of our  employees, as well as  the impact on our staff  in terms of well-being                                                   | Human  and expertise                                                                        |\n|                   | and engagement All natural resources  that we directly or  indirectly use via our  operations, such as  energy and water The investment of our  client assets in  sustainable and impact  funds that contribute to  natural or  environmental goals | Natural                                                                                     |\n|                   | The investment of our  client assets in  sustainable and impact  funds that contribute to  social goals, such as                                                                                                                                    | Social The network we have as  an organisation and the  trust that our clients  place in us |\n\nhealth and the food\n\n## Impact on stakeholders\n\nWhen we put these various types of capital to work, this has an impact on our clients, employees, shareholders, bondholders and society.

Funds can be obtained through financing, such as debt, equity or grants, or generated through operations or investments.\n\n## Our approach\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent, specialist wealth manager with a capital-light balance sheet. Our profitability, growth and cost effectiveness are important to our stakeholders. We are aware that we have both direct and indirect impacts on the economy, environment and communities via our business: investing our clients' assets, the investments on our balance sheet and managing our loan portfolio. We include more detail on these impacts and how we manage them under \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" and \"Building personal relationships\" on pages 45-52.\n\n## Financial targets\n\nIn 2022, we set medium-term targets that remained unchanged in the reporting year:\n\n- -A Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio of 15% plus an add-on of 2.5% for acquisitions, the latter offering enough scope for bolt-on acquisitions appropriate to our wealth management strategy;\n- -A cost/income ratio of 70%, reflecting our ambition to grow our revenues coupled with controlled cost growth;\n- -A 12% return on CET 1 through the cycle;\n- -A dividend policy of 50-70% of underlying net profit attributable to shareholders.\n\n| KPIs                        | Targets                  | Performance in  2023   | Performance in  2022   |\n|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 1. CET 1 ratio              | 15% + M&A add-on of 2.5% | 19.6%                  | 20.6%                  |\n| 2. Return on equity (CET 1) | 12% through the cycle    | 14.2%                  | 12.3%                  |\n| 3. Cost/income ratio        | 70%                      | 71.6%                  | 73.1%                  |\n\n## Financial performance and risk management\n\nFinancial performance and risk management are key to our organisation, as all direct stakeholders benefit from a solid capital position and sustainable performance.\n\nIn 2023, our CET 1 ratio was 19.6%, down from 20.6% in 2022. This decrease reflects the capital return to shareholders in December 2023, offset by the issuance of new shares as part of the accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nOur return on CET 1 stood at 14.2%, meeting our throughthe-cycle target. Our cost/income ratio amounted to 71.6%, above our medium-term target. For more details on our financial results, including the developments underlying this ratio, see 'Financial performance' on page 54.\n\nSupported by our strong client relationships, we aim to generate sustainable and profitable growth, while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. Our ambition is to grow our assets under management (AuM) by around 10% a year on average, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance.\n\n## Investing for further growth versus maintaining our cost/ income ratio\n\nIn order to achieve profitable growth, our approach must also take into account scalability and cost management. Our corporate and support departments, such as IT, finance and risk, need to be as scalable as possible in order to manage costs. At the same time, our wealth management proposition distinguishes itself on the personal attention we pay to our clients, which naturally limits scalability to some extent. During the reporting year, we needed to make choices about how to accelerate our investment in future growth while improving our cost/income ratio.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of financial capital through a number of key performance indicators (KPIs):",

On the left-hand side, the capital deployed by Van Lanschot Kempen in our business model is listed, divided into separate categories. On the right-hand side, the capital generated is listed, also divided into categories. The items listed in the tables are intended as examples, and should not be used to calculate our overall value creation. We have not included totals in these tables because inputs and outputs of one type of capital can also be deployed and transformed into another type of capital.\n\n## How we create value\n\nAs this table shows, our financial capital inputs consist mainly of our operating income and the capital received from shareholders and bondholders. Our financial capital outputs can, for the most part, be considered as redistribution of our revenues. We create value for shareholders and bondholders through dividend and coupon payments and capital returns; for our employees through the salaries and variable remuneration we pay; and for society at large through the taxes we pay.\n\nFor more information on the development of commission income, interest income and costs, see \"Financial performance\" on page 54.\n\n## Tax transparency\n\nIn 2022, Dutch employers' federation VNO-NCW introduced the Tax Governance Code, which aims to provide more insight into the tax strategy of large international companies and what they pay in the countries in which they operate. Van Lanschot Kempen has subscribed to the Tax Governance Code. For more information about how we report on tax, see our 2023 tax transparency report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.",

It also includes the impact that we make via home ownership and mortgages.\n\n## Our approach\n\nPreserving and creating wealth, by putting the money entrusted to us by our clients to work, is our licence to operate. We aim to put our clients front and centre when finding solutions for them, and the organisational changes that we made in the reporting year will allow us to become more nimble and respond more quickly to changing client needs.\n\n## Wealth generation for our clients\n\nOur clients trust us to manage their wealth effectively and to make a positive contribution via our investment solutions. They expect risk-rewarding returns that enable the preservation and growth of their financial assets, in a sustainable way. Our wealth management solutions and investment strategies should also perform well compared with their benchmarks.\n\nOur portfolio managers have the freedom to create and manage a strategy that is in line with their clients' interests as well as our own values and investment beliefs. We have set up professional investment processes that focus on longterm value creation for our investment strategies and the portfolios of our private and institutional clients. Each team plays a pivotal role in the investment process, governance (including clear responsibilities) and optimum use of systems and tools, in order to achieve the most positive outcomes.\n\nIn addition to comparing the relative financial returns of our managed propositions against that of their respective benchmarks, we assess the quality and relevance of our solutions via external assessments (for example, Morningstar medallist ratings and sustainability globes). We consider the sustainability performance of our products to be directly linked to long-term value creation, and an integral element of the quality and relevance of our solutions. We include more detail on the impact of our assets under management (AuM) and how we manage it under \"Reducing our carbon footprint\" and \"Building personal relationships\" on pages 45-52.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of manufactured capital through the key performance indicator (KPI) shown below:\n\n| KPIs                                                           | Targets     | Performance in  2023   | Performance in  2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| 4.

The three-year average performance is calculated by comparing the year-end absolute performance of our three largest discretionary solutions over the last three years with their respective benchmarks.\n\nIn 2023, the three-year average performance of our managed propositions relative to their benchmarks stood at -0.2%, not meeting our target to outperform the benchmark. This was partly due to our cautious positioning in equities, and partly due to our investments in sustainability themes (such as clean energy) within the equity portfolio, which lagged behind the benchmark in terms of returns.",

Our manufactured capital outputs consist mainly of investment returns for our clients, and the financing we arrange for them.\n\n## Wealth management proposition\n\nIn the first half of 2023, we launched a new wealth management proposition, enabling private banking clients in the Netherlands to tailor their investment portfolios. Through this, we offer access to our institutional expertise and both in-house and third-party solutions - enabling clients to invest in our Global Impact Fund, Private Markets Fund and Non-Directional Partnership, for instance. For more information, read our feature on page 91.\n\nWe've also seen significant inflow in our advisory proposition, which we continuously improve. Many clients put excess savings, built up over recent years, into advisory (rather than discretionary) products in 2023. They wanted to increase their holdings in fixed income investments, after years of underinvestment due to low yields - something they were able to impact directly in the advisory proposition. However, in the last two months of the year, some clients switched back to savings rather than reinvesting the funds from maturing bonds.\n\nThe reporting year also saw somewhat of a transition in the types of assets clients hold with us. As a result of changes in the financial markets, fixed income became an investable asset class once again, and clients have made use of this opportunity. As a consequence, we've seen more short-term investments in fixed income and money market funds.\n\n## Pension schemes\n\nIn our fiduciary management business, we serve pension fund clients - advising them on the unique needs of large group schemes and creating investment mixes to meet those needs. In doing so, we create value for around 2.3 million pension scheme members in the Netherlands and the UK.\n\n## AuM and investment returns\n\nIn 2023, we saw very strong total net AuM inflows of \u20ac5.3 billion, with contributions from all client segments. After a challenging 2022, markets rebounded in 2023 and most asset classes generated positive returns, with US and European stock markets ending the year close to all-time highs. The three-year average investment return amounted to -\u20ac0.9 billion overall, with 2021 and 2023 adding positive returns for our clients.\n\n## Residential mortgages\n\nBy providing mortgages, we help our clients purchase homes and guide them during the entire duration of the mortgage. In November 2023, we introduced our new mortgage proposition: a single, complete, sustainable mortgage solution for our clients. We incentivise the purchase of a more sustainable home or efforts to make the home more sustainable. The mortgage interest rate is linked to the home's registered energy label: the higher the energy efficiency, the lower the interest rate for the client.\n\nWe estimate the increased personal wealth of our Dutch clients due to home ownership (compared with renting a property) at \u20ac163 million in 2023. Within this estimate, we take into account the interest costs, tax benefits linked to mortgage interest deduction, real-estate taxes for home owners and increases in housing prices - compared with a reference scenario in which our mortgage clients would rent a property. We attribute the increased personal wealth due to home ownership to the \"clients\" stakeholder group.",

This represents a boost to the building and construction sector, which we estimate to be worth \u20ac4 million in 2023. We attribute this value to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the tax benefits extended to home owners via the mortgage interest deduction scheme reduce tax income for the Dutch government, in comparison with the reference scenario in which our clients would rent a property. We estimate this loss in tax income at \u20ac46 million in 2023, and attribute this to the \"society\" stakeholder group.\n\n## Other loans\n\nThe other loans portfolio comprises loans to high net-worth individuals as well as commercial loans that fit into our private clients relationship model, such as loans to healthcare clients, family businesses and business professionals. Through these business loans, we facilitate economic activities that in turn boost other economic activities via the so-called multiplier effect. Using inputoutput modelling, we estimate the total economic impact of these loans to be approximately \u20ac1,808 million.",

Their professionalism, expertise, skills and behaviour determine the quality of our service and client experience. We believe that engaged, knowledgeable, accountable people provide better service to our clients and are more engaged.\n\nOver the last few years, we've made considerable efforts to optimise our HR processes and practices. In 2023, we focused on the employee journey, from inflow to the \"working at\" phase to outflow. We've also been improving our use of data, so that we can move from analysing past trends to anticipating future trends.\n\n## Attracting, retaining and developing talent\n\nOur strategy is to be an attractive and inclusive employer for the talent available in the labour market - continuously striving to recruit a diverse range of talented professionals.\n\nIn addition to a significant recruitment drive, our focus in 2023 was on retention. For this, throughflow is becoming more and more important: providing training and education, ensuring flexible and inclusive working conditions, and offering career development opportunities. Our challenge going forward is to make sure we're offering attractive employment conditions for every generation, each of which has different requirements and expectations.\n\n## Organisational restructuring versus employee engagement\n\nThe reporting year was a challenging one for our Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Investment Banking Clients segments. This required some careful organisational restructuring in order to grow the business while controlling costs. In the teams responsible for investment solutions, this meant letting go of some of our talented professionals, which naturally had an impact on their colleagues as well. At the same time, we invested in our commercial strength through extensive sales training courses, for instance. Employee engagement in this part of the business remained high at 87%.\n\n## Key performance indicators\n\nWe steer and monitor the value we create in terms of human capital through a number of key performance indicators (KPIs):\n\n| KPIs                                                                                                  | Targets                                                  | Performance in  2023    | Performance in  2022    |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n| 5.

It's based on the percentage of employees who are promoters of the organisation, minus the percentage of employees who are detractors. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6. In 2023, our eNPS was 22, up from the 18 scored in 2022 and higher than the target of 10. This is a strong outcome and shows that employees would recommend Van Lanschot Kempen as a good place to work.\n\nDuring the reporting year, we carried out our annual employee engagement survey and we held one pulse survey. The response rate was 84% for the annual engagement survey and 75% for the pulse survey.\n\nOur engagement score was 90%, up from 88% scored in 2022, and higher than the financial services industry benchmark of 86%. Our score based on questions relating to inclusion and diversity remained unchanged at 88%.\n\nOur 2023 pulse survey focused on the key drivers behind employee loyalty: when we asked people why they choose to stay at Van Lanschot Kempen, they cited the key reasons as development opportunities, working culture and the impact they're able to make.",

        "page_content": "## Inclusion and diversity\n\nOur commitment to inclusion and diversity goes hand in hand with our ambition to positively contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive world. We firmly believe that we need to foster an inclusive workplace where everyone's unique contributions are valued and where we optimise our combined talents. Our willingness to gain new perspectives, value differences and adapt to change is instrumental in making diversity work for us.\n\n## Our inclusion and diversity policy\n\nWe aim for diversity not only in terms of gender, nationality, age, educational background, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, ethnic background, disability or distance to the labour market, but also across personal experiences, characteristics, socio-economic backgrounds and the different skills that people bring. We recognise the value of bringing diverse perspectives to the table, and realise it takes time to learn and adapt in order to get there. In line with this, we are committed to ensuring we take steps to attract, develop and retain a diverse range of talent.\n\nFor more information, read our full inclusion and diversity policy on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/ inclusion-and-diversity.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Gender diversity targets and measures\n\nIn terms of gender diversity, we aim for 50% male and 50% female in our inflow across all levels. To support the business in achieving this balance, we:\n\n- -Offer flexible hours and working conditions;\n- -Embed unbiased interview technique training in our hiring process (to standardise the approach);\n- -Use game-based assessment for junior positions (to reduce the potential for biased decision-making);\n- -Have partnerships with agencies and networks focusing on female talent.\n\nWe also aim for a minimum of 30% women and 30% men in the three levels immediately below the Management Board (senior staff) - see KPI 8. To achieve this target, we have drafted concrete action plans in collaboration with employees and our Management Board. For instance, when it comes to recruiting for senior staff positions, our intention is to have a final recruitment shortlist that is well balanced from a gender perspective. In 2024, we will pay extra attention to building an external network of potential female candidates for future positions at mid to senior levels. For inflow at entry level, we will continue with our targeted campus recruitment and young talent attraction approach.\n\nWe believe that throughflow, supported by good succession planning, is important for keeping home-grown talent within our organisation. We apply the principle that the internal pipeline should be activated through talent reviews, succession planning and workforce planning. We aim for proportional promotions while also taking into account the composition of our workforce. For instance, we have a number of support functions where there is limited scope for promotion - roles that are often held by women.\n\nAt year-end 2023, the inflow of female employees year-onyear was 41%, the same as in 2022. In contrast, the gender balance among senior staff was 19.0% female, which represents a slight improvement of 1.1% percentage points\n\ncompared with year-end 2022 at 17.9%, though still well below our target of 30%. This demonstrates that, while inflow of female talent is progressing at entry level, it is advancing more slowly at senior leadership level. We acknowledge that achieving our targets will take persistent effort over a longer period of time.\n\nTo maintain continuous awareness of our target for senior staff, and to foster commitment to achieving our shared action plan, the topic of gender diversity is regularly discussed by our management teams.\n\n## Reducing the gender pay gap\n\nIn the methodology used to assess the gender pay gap, a correction is made for differences in pay due to age, job level and tenure, for example, as opposed to differences that cannot be explained. In 2022, our unexplained corrected gender pay gap was 2.7%. To our concern, in 2023 the gender pay gap rose slightly to 3%, which remains above our KPI target of less than 2%. As the reporting year was the third in a row that we measured the gender pay gap in this way, we now have a deeper understanding of the key drivers. To better understand and subsequently mitigate the increase, we performed a number of additional analyses, which concluded that the gap was not driven by new hires or merit increases, but by promotional increases and variable remuneration.\n\nWe are continuing to take steps towards meeting our target. For example, we implemented extra checks on the 2023 end-of-year proposed salary increases and allocations of variable remuneration. This is in line with our view that the appropriate checks and balances need to be embedded in the remuneration and rewards process. Flagging potential issues is now part of the day-to-day work of our HR teams. Another example relates to the hiring process, during which we take steps to reduce the potential for bias, by setting salary bands for roles and by training our recruitment team not to ask for previous salary information.",

        "page_content": "## Diversity in ethnicity\n\nIn 2023, we also took steps to broaden the ethnic diversity of our workforce. We began a collaboration with Roots Inspire: a leadership development platform that helps organisations build an internal pipeline of ethnically diverse leaders under the guidance of inspiring role models. The programme works from all angles: offering development for existing colleagues, mentoring external talent that we would like to attract to our organisation, and working with current leaders in our organisation to learn about the perceived career blockers. Our intention is to attract candidates who can bring their unique perspectives to the table.\n\n## Employee resource groups\n\nIn 2023, we added the Van Lanschot Kempen International Network to our employee resource groups, alongside our Women's Network, Young Network and Pride Network. Expanding the remit of these networks beyond events that bring our colleagues together, our Pride Network took a leading role in supporting our organisation in becoming more gender inclusive in 2023. We published guidance on gender inclusivity and added gender transition leave to our employee conditions (as well as leave for parents whose child is transitioning). We also rewrote our internal documentation - such as our contracts, employee conditions and internal letters - to make it more personal and gender neutral. This is another important step towards our goal for all colleagues to feel comfortable being themselves at Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of human capital: inputs and outputs\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)         | From   | Amount  2023   | Amount  2022 Output (\u20ac million)   | For   |   Amount  2023 |   Amount  2022 |\n|---------------------------|--------|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| Opportunity costs of work | E      | n/a            | n/a Social value of having work   | E     |           24.1 |           20.9 |\n| Opportunity costs of work | E      | n/a            | Work-related illness              | E     |           -2   |           -1.7 |\n| Opportunity costs of work | E      | n/a            | Gender pay gap                    | E     |           -2   |           -1.8 |\n\n## How we create value\n\nAs this table shows, our human capital inputs consist of the opportunity costs of work by our employees, meaning the value of the hours our employees spend working for Van Lanschot Kempen. We aim to add value to these human capital inputs through our business model - for example, by creating attractive jobs that result in additional social value for our employees. However, such outputs can also be negative - as in the case of work-related illnesses.\n\n## Opportunity costs of work\n\nEconomists have developed various methods to assign a monetary value to the time employees spend working. These methods all have pros and cons. A downside to many methodologies is that they are not based on a reference scenario in which employees conduct other paid work.\n\nSince employees generally require an income to maintain their livelihoods, this would be more valid than comparing the average monetary value an employee assigns to one working hour with one leisure hour.\n\n## Social value of having work\n\nNumerous studies show that people with a job are more satisfied with their lives than people without one. Several of these studies also focus specifically on quantifying this social value, usually by means of a \"well-being valuation\". Through this econometric method, developed to measure the value of so-called non-market goods, we can determine the monetary value of increased life satisfaction as a result of having a job.\n\n## Absenteeism, health and well-being\n\nEmployees' health and well-being is a top priority for Van Lanschot Kempen. Supported by our health and wellbeing programme, illness due to absence dropped in the reporting year to 2.6% (from 2.8% in 2022). Feedback from employees shows that they value benefits such as flexible working, and that many people have participated in wellness activities such as sleep seminars and mindfulness workshops.\n\n| Key staff data                                                                   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Employees (FTEs at year-end)                                                     | 1,904   | 1,780   |\n| Investment in training (\u20ac million)                                               | 4.5     | 4.7     |\n| Training hours (estimated total number  of hours, individually and collectively) | 102,100 | 103,600 |\n| Female/male ratio (%)                                                            | 36/64   | 33/67   |\n\n| Staff at year-end (FTEs)           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Private Clients                    | 657    | 585    |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients  | 43     | 44     |\n| Investment Banking Clients         | 102    | 115    |\n| Investment Strategies & Solutions  | 157    | 169    |\n| Digital, Advanced Analytics &      | 332    | 305    |\n| Client Administration & Monitoring | 123    | 98     |\n| Corporate and support departments  | 489    | 464    |\n| Total                              | 1,904  | 1,780  |",

        "page_content": "Based on estimates of the value that employees attach to their work beyond their remuneration, the social value of all jobs at Van Lanschot Kempen in 2023 amounted to \u20ac24.1 million - attributed to employees - compared with \u20ac20.9 million in 2022. For our calculations, we use a generic estimate from a study by Fujiwara 1 and apply different valuations for employees aged up to 30, between 30 and 50, and over 50.\n\n## Work-related illness\n\nIn contrast to the social value of having work, the negative impact of work-related illness on employees' quality of life is also reflected in our contribution to human capital and social value. To calculate this, we use the disability-adjusted life year (DALY) method developed by the World Health Organization. A DALY is an international measure of missed happiness in life due to illness. In short, every healthy year of life counts for 1 DALY, and the DALY is lowered for each year in which an employee is ill by using a weighting factor.\n\nWe combine this data with illness-related absentee data for the average Dutch employee (from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment - RIVM) and the value of one year of life (from CE Delft, an independent research organisation) to calculate the total impact. Based on this calculation, the total negative impact from arm, neck and shoulder complaints, back pain and burnout in 2023 amounted to \u20ac2.0 million, compared with \u20ac1.7 million in 2022.\n\n## Other achievements and developments\n\n## Employee development\n\nCareer development is an ongoing priority, as we have seen that it's one of the key drivers for employee retention. At the same time, the quality of our workforce has a direct impact on the experience of the clients we serve. In 2023, we continued our programmes to develop our leaders at strategic and operational levels and to support managers in successfully managing their teams.\n\nWe have set up a Van Lanschot Kempen Academy for all overarching learning solutions; underneath that umbrella, we have set up specialist academies. In 2023, we made significant progress on deploying our learning platform for relevant educational opportunities, and on improving our mandatory training programmes, such as our code of conduct training. In 2024, we will further develop all academies through content curation and development. This will contribute to our growth and development ambitions in the future.\n\n## Artificial intelligence\n\nAt Van Lanschot Kempen, we are actively investigating the potential for artificial intelligence (AI). In 2023, our focus was on experimenting and raising awareness of the possibilities. In 2024, we will focus on preparing the workforce for this shift in approach by training our people on how to use AI most effectively.\n\n## Throughflow\n\nWe have set a target that 30% of vacancies (excluding entry level positions) should be filled by internal candidates. To support this, we focus on awareness and inspiration by sharing success stories and organising events to highlight internal opportunities. In 2023, 30% of vacancies were filled by internal candidates, up from 19% in 2022.\n\n## Participation plans\n\nIn 2023, we further optimised our employee participation plan, known as the Matching Share Plan, which offers an attractive investment opportunity in Van Lanschot Kempen, as well as the chance to share in the company's success.\n\nThe reporting year was also the second for the Van Lanschot Kempen Partnership: a long-term participation plan for key senior employees. Its purpose is to anchor leadership more broadly in the organisation, further promote ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, and create more long-term alignment with our shareholders and clients. For more information about both of these participation plans, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 88.",

Natural capital includes air, water, land, minerals, forests, biodiversity and ecosystem health.\n\n## Our approach\n\nAs a wealth manager with a long-term focus, we aim to help our clients to navigate the key transitions of this decade: in energy and food.\n\n## Limiting climate change by supporting the energy transition\n\nWe intend to support the energy transition in several ways: by advising clients to direct their investments towards companies that are working on this; by allocating capital to companies that work to reduce their carbon footprint; by enhancing our mortgage solutions to help and encourage clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes; and by switching to a fully electric company car fleet for our own organisation.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2023, we also invested in reforestation projects. As these forests grow, the trees will absorb and store more carbon dioxide. We aim to use only certificates from our own reforestation projects to offset our remaining operational carbon emissions in the near future. In the meantime, we continue to offset the remaining carbon emissions from our own operations through carbon offsets purchased from a service provider.\n\nFor more information on our approach to help limit climate change, see our climate strategy and action plan on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-policiesand-resources.\n\n## Preventing biodiversity loss by supporting the food transition\n\nThe intensification of agriculture in recent decades has played a critical role in increasing biodiversity loss. We aim to limit and reverse biodiversity loss, primarily by advancing the food transition and by focusing on halting deforestation. For instance, we invest in farms that deploy regenerative or nature-inclusive techniques through our SDG Farmland Fund.\n\nIn the reporting year, we also engaged with TotalEnergies on their East African Crude Oil Pipeline Project, which is likely to negatively impact unique and fragile ecosystems in Uganda and Tanzania. In response, the company indicated that it is exploring options to limit this impact and to develop biodiversity offsetting plans. We will continue to follow this project closely.\n\nFor more information on our approach to help limit and reverse biodiversity loss, see our biodiversity policy on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-policiesand-resources.\n\n## Our commitments\n\nWe've made a commitment to help limit climate change to +1.5 o C. For our own operations, we aim to be carbon neutral by 2030; and for our assets under under management (AuM), we aim to be carbon neutral by 2050. To this end, we have stepped up our ambitions starting in 2024:\n\n- -Discretionary (AuM) : We aim to reduce the annual weighted average carbon intensity (WACI) of our discretionary AuM by 7% per year (against a 2019 baseline in the case of most portfolios);\n- -Own organisation : We have increased our target to reduce the annual average carbon intensity per FTE from 7% to 8% per year (against a 2019 baseline).\n\nBy signing the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge, we have committed to assessing our biodiversity impact through our investments and financing activities, and to setting targets to increase positive impacts and reduce significant negative impacts.\n\nRead more about how we fulfil our responsible investment approach in our upcoming stewardship and sustainable investment report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/ en-nl/about-us/sustainability/reporting-and-regulation.",

In 2023, the aggregate carbon footprint of our AuM (Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions) was 4.0 million tonnes CO2e (see table on the following page), with coverage of 53% (KPI 13.c).\n\nThe carbon footprint of our AuM is partially determined by that of our own funds and discretionary management solutions. At year-end 2023, 88% of our funds met our target to reduce carbon intensity by an average of 7% per year (against a 2019 baseline) in accordance with the Paris Agreement-aligned benchmark or EU climate transition benchmark (KPI 13.b.i).\n\nThe carbon footprint of our fiduciary management solutions is largely dependent on the choices or preferences of our clients. At year-end 2023, 72% of our fiduciary management clients had adopted Paris Agreement-aligned benchmarks, compared with 59% in 2022 (KPI 13.b.ii).\n\nThe average Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) data quality score for the carbon footprint of our AuM is roughly 3, on a scale from 1 (highest quality) to 5 (lowest quality). For many investments in corporates, we have access to reported (verified or non-verified)\n\ninformation on their carbon emissions through our data providers. For other asset classes, however, this is less common.\n\nWe engaged with 44 out of the 49 top 50% most carbonintensive companies in the portfolios of our listed funds, and divested from three - falling short of our target (KPI 14.c). Our aim is to encourage these companies to integrate climate risks and opportunities into their long-term business models and to enable them to thrive in the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nThe total indirect emissions per euro of our mortgage portfolio decreased by 6.9% year-on-year, likely due to lower energy consumption because of higher energy prices and warmer weather (in 2022 compared with 2021). Moreover, the average energy-efficiency rating of the collateral for our residential mortgages improved. The carbon footprint as disclosed in this annual report is based on our residential mortgage portfolio at year-end 2023, energy consumption data over 2022, and carbon emission factors for 2021 (as more recent energy consumption data and carbon emission factors are not available at the time of reporting).\n\nTo monitor our progress against our target to reduce indirect emissions via our mortgage portfolio (KPI 13.d), we apply the methodology prescribed by the Dutch chapter of the PCAF, with some specific deviations. Based on the guidelines that we co-drafted with other financial",

In 2023, the average PCAF data quality score was 3.06.\n\n## Own organisation\n\nIn 2023, the carbon footprint of our own operations totalled 2,789 tonnes CO2e, or 1.38 tonnes CO2e per FTE (2022: 2,775 tonnes CO2e, or 1.45 tonnes CO2e per FTE). Our carbon emissions per FTE decreased slightly compared with 2022, meaning we remain on track to reduce the carbon emissions of our own organisation by at least 7% per FTE per year, against a 2019 baseline (KPI 13.a).\n\nFor more information on the environmental impact of our own operations, see our sustainability supplement: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.\n\n## Sustainability of our solutions\n\nIn 2023, 23.1% of our AuM were invested in sustainable and impact investment solutions (based on our own scoring framework). In general, these apply a best-in-class approach to select either more sustainable investments and impact solutions or those that are well-positioned to become leaders in the energy and/or food transitions. Such solutions also need to provide a measurable contribution to resolving sustainability challenges.\n\nWe aim to increase the proportion of AuM invested in sustainable and impact investment solutions by 5 percentage points per year (KPI 14.a). By year-end 2023, we had screened 64% of our AuM (2022: 58%). Of these screened assets, 34% were invested in sustainable investment solutions and 2% in impact investment solutions (2022: 33% and 3% respectively). In 2023, the percentage of internal and external funds/mandates on our approved list that met our basic sustainability criteria was 96% (KPI 14.b).\n\n## Carbon footprint of our assets under management in 2023 1\n\n| Absolute footprint (million tCO2e, Scope  1 and 2 carbon  emissions)   | Absolute footprint (million tCO2e, Scope  3 carbon emissions)   | Relative footprint (tCO2e/\u20ac m invested,  Scope 1, 2, and 3   | Carbon intensity (tCO2e/\u20ac m sales,  Scope 1, 2, and 3   | Coverage Scope 1 and  2 carbon emissions  data (CO2e based on   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                                        |                                                                 | carbon emissions)                                            | carbon emissions)                                       | % AuM)                                                          |\n| 4.0                                                                    | 32.4                                                            | 317                                                          | 856                                                     | 53%                                                             |\n\n## Quantifying our value creation\n\n## Overview of natural capital: inputs and outputs\n\nS: society\n\n| Input (\u20ac million)   | From   | Amount  2023   | Amount  2022 Output (\u20ac million)                             | For   |   Amount  2023 |   Amount  2022 |\n|---------------------|--------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------|----------------|\n| Energy, water, etc. | S      | n/a            | n/a Client investments in sustainable  equity funds (AuM) 2 | S     |            1.8 |           32.6 |\n|                     |        |                | Carbon footprint of our AuM                                 | S     |         -173.4 |         -468.6 |\n|                     |        |                | Carbon footprint of our balance  sheet                      | S     |           -2.9 |          -17.9 |\n|                     |        |                | Carbon footprint of our own  organisation                   | S     |           -0.1 |           -0.5 |\n\n## How we create value\n\nAs this table shows, our impact on natural capital - both positive and negative - is mainly via the products and solutions we provide and our organisational footprint. By comparison, the natural capital inputs that we use - such as energy and water - are limited and are therefore not reported. Van Lanschot Kempen's primary inputs come from financial capital streams, and are transformed into natural capital outputs.\n\n## Client investments in sustainability-labelled equity funds\n\nAs shown in the table above, the natural capital alignment of all our sustainability-labelled equity funds in aggregate (\u20ac769 million) is estimated at \u20ac1.8 million (2022: \u20ac32.6 million). If the \u20ac769 million had been invested in benchmark funds instead, the natural capital alignment would be estimated at -\u20ac86.5 million (2022: -\u20ac67.2 million).",

        "page_content": "Our calculations are based on company sales data per investee, indicating which portion of sales could be linked (positively or negatively) to a set of natural and social themes, provided by a data vendor. Adding up the sales numbers for the natural themes resulted in the total contribution to natural capital. Although we recognise that this aggregation may result in a product or service of an investee being attributed to more than one (natural or social) theme, we do not expect this to materially influence the final outcome of our analysis. The main reason is that our aggregation is conducted both for positive and negative impacts, and consequently smooths out the potential for double-counting.\n\nFor more information on the natural capital alignment of our sustainable investment funds, see our upcoming stewardship and sustainable investment report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/sustainability/ reporting-and-regulation.\n\n## Carbon footprint of our AuM, balance sheet and own organisation\n\nStarting in 2022, we made progress on expressing the impact of the carbon footprint associated with our AuM, balance sheet and own organisation in monetary terms. It's widely acknowledged that our current level of carbon emissions will have a profound impact on society in the longer term, in the form of climate change and all its likely effects. Various institutions have estimated the costs for future generations to address these effects, with the most generally accepted estimate so far being provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Based on this, we estimate the costs of our carbon footprint to society at approximately \u20ac173.4 million (AuM), \u20ac2.9 million (balance sheet) and \u20ac0.1 million (own organisation) in 2023. These impacts are lower than in 2022, as the US EPA downgraded its estimate of the costs of carbon emissions to society.",

        "page_content": "## Building personal relationships\n\n## Social capital\n\nWe define social capital as the relationships within and between groups of stakeholders. In our case, social capital includes our long-standing, personal relationships with clients as well as the social impact we make via our clients' assets.\n\n## Our approach\n\nFor Van Lanschot Kempen, social capital is all about our client relationships. The personal relationships we forge with our clients are key reasons for them to choose our company to manage their wealth. Our success and that of our clients is grounded in our ability to provide easy-to-access, seamless customer journeys via various channels (e.g. app, face-toface, phone) and the right services and solutions at the right time, leading to high levels of client satisfaction.\n\nWe also increase social capital by investing client wealth in sustainable and impact funds that contribute specifically to social goals, such as living better for longer. But as a result of our investment of client assets and our lending activities, in some cases there may be negative impacts in our supply chains - for example, relating to labour rights, human rights or other social issues.\n\n## Building relationships\n\nWe give clients access to our extensive network by bringing different groups together. For example, we organise lunches with entrepreneurs, we invite corporate finance clients and executives to events together, and we work with nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) on our policies. In 2023, we worked with the NGO World Animal Protection on improving our policy on animal welfare. The adjustments made led to the rejection of financing requests in selected sectors that do not meet the established criteria, along with enhanced screening in high-risk sectors concerning animal welfare.\n\n## Human rights\n\nWe are committed to respecting international human rights in every role we play - as described in our human rights and labour rights policy. The policy summarises our commitments to monitor and increase the level of responsible business conduct, and respect and adhere to the human rights of all stakeholders, in terms of the organisations that we invest in, the businesses we finance, our business partners and our own operations.\n\n## Living better for longer\n\nWe aim to make a significant impact on ensuring healthy lives through our various roles - as investor, solutions and service provider, adviser, lender, purchaser and employer. While our human rights and labour rights policy emphasises avoiding harm, our living better for longer policy focuses on seizing opportunities to contribute to progress and development in this field. We prioritise areas where we have the expertise and resources to make meaningful contributions, including healthcare, access to medicine and the provision of healthy and nutritious food.\n\nBoth policies are available on our website:\n\nvanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-policies-andresources.\n\n## Navigating a polarised society\n\nIn recent years, society has become more polarised - with topics such as gender inclusivity, climate, politics and religion pitting groups against one another. There's a call for companies and leaders to be more vocal and to take a stand on these matters. We believe in following a path of dialogue and engagement, including with our investee companies. And we need to find a balance here: deciding when to continue to engage and when to make a statement.\n\n## Ethics and integrity\n\nThe financial sector is built on trust, and a healthy culture and ethical behaviour are needed to sustain this trust with all our stakeholders. We can only fulfil our role if all our stakeholders are able to place their trust in us. That's why we're convinced that strong ethics and integrity must be at the heart of our organisation.\n\nOur code of conduct, which we updated in 2023, is based on three ethical principles that guide employees on how to behave with integrity and balance the interests of all stakeholders:\n\n- -We are respectful towards others\n- -We act with discretion\n- -We think across generations\n\nAll employees are required to sign both our code of conduct and the Banker's Oath. And all our products and services are subject to strict approval and review procedures, including relevant assessments by Compliance. For more information, see the governance section on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/who-we-are/ governance.\n\nThe Banking Code, with which we also comply, sets out principles for sound and controlled business operations, corporate governance, risk management policies, and audit and remuneration policies. As stated in the Banking Code, the Management and Supervisory Boards are responsible for developing and maintaining standards of integrity and ethical behaviour.\n\nThere are various internal mechanisms for employees who are seeking advice, or for reporting concerns about ethical issues, unethical or unlawful behaviour, and organisational integrity - for example, via their managers and the HR and Compliance departments. We have a whistleblower policy and a complaints procedure in place; we have also appointed internal advisers to whom employees can speak confidentially.\n\n## Sponsorships\n\nWe see our sponsorship activities as a form of social capital, as they involve building relationships, networks and goodwill among individuals, organisations and communities.",

To measure their satisfaction and loyalty, we use the NPS, which provides insight into client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6. The NPS that we measure is also known as the Relationship NPS. We measure this four times a year for Private Clients and Evi van Lanschot, and once every two years for Wholesale & Institutional Clients.\n\nIn 2023, our private clients 3 awarded us an NPS of 34, higher than our target of 20 and just below our 2022 score of 36. This can be attributed to our personal approach in talking to our clients and their appreciation of our digital and investment services.\n\nThe NPS for Evi van Lanschot increased to 0 in 2023, lower than our target of 10 (2022: -1). In general, clients appreciate the investment app as well as our communications and service, but see room for improvement in their investment returns.\n\nFor the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, we measure the NPS once every two years, as the relationships with - and solutions provided to - wholesale and institutional clients do not change as quickly as can be the case with private clients. The most recent NPS of 30 awarded by wholesale and institutional clients in 2023 was above our target of 20.\n\nAmong our corporate finance clients, building long-term client relationships is measured via the percentage of successful transactions with repeat clients during a year. A client is defined as a repeat corporate finance client if they have made a successful fee-generating transaction with us in the past five years. The score on this KPI indicates whether existing clients are doing business with us again, as well as our ability to acquire new clients. In 2023, 56% of transactions were with repeat clients, in line with our target range of 50-60%. This indicates client loyalty is high and shows that our clients value the quality of the services we provide.",

In 2023, the number of interactions (indexed against a 2020 baseline) stood at 156 - exceeding our target of 130 - because we focused even more on engaging in valuable dialogues, providing thematic analyses and sharing our investment ideas.\n\nA crucial element in our relationship with clients is the extent to which their expectations are met by the quality and effectiveness of our solutions. The quality of our investment strategies is measured via the average Morningstar rating of these strategies in the institutional share class. At year-end 2023, our strategies were awarded 2 silver, 7 bronze and 8 neutral ratings.\n\n## Active ownership\n\nActive ownership is one of the pillars of our responsible investment approach.

Based on our assessment, our sustainable equity funds in aggregate over 2023 (\u20ac769 million) made a net positive contribution of \u20ac32.9 million to seven social themes. 4 If the \u20ac769 million had been invested in the benchmarks of these sustainable equity funds instead, the social capital alignment would be estimated at \u20ac38.0 million.\n\nFor more information on the social capital alignment of our sustainable investment funds, see our upcoming stewardship and sustainable investment report on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/sustainability/ reporting-and-regulation.\n\nIn addition to engaging with companies on avoiding harm and controversies, we proactively enter company dialogues on doing things better. In 2023, one notable engagement was with global sports brand Nike: we collaborated with other investors in co-signing a letter urging the company to address its outstanding wage payment issues. We also engaged with French construction and infrastructure company Vinci SA: we are striving to align variable remuneration with ambitious occupational health and safety targets.\n\n## Ethical behaviour\n\nOur approach to ethical behaviour is described at the beginning of this section. We monitor whether our employees positively rate our culture regarding ethical behaviour and integrity via employee engagement surveys. Employees are asked to evaluate whether we operate with integrity in both our internal and external dealings, and if they feel they could report dishonest or unethical practices without fear of reprisal. The outcome is benchmarked against other financial services firms (by an external organisation) and was above the industry average at the end of 2023, in line with our target.\n\nIn 2023, two ethical incidents were reported (2022: two incidents), and these have since been handled according to the relevant policies and procedures.",

We propose a dividend of \u20ac2.00 per share for 2023 (2022: \u20ac1.75 per share).\n\nThe increase in net result compared with 2022 is due to multiple items. Securities commissions rose by 11% in 2023 thanks to strong growth in assets under management (AuM), while net interest income increased significantly (by 21%) driven by a higher interest rate environment. In addition, the sale of our participating interest in Movares resulted in increased income from securities and associates. Lastly, 2022 saw higher costs under special items due to the accelerated acquisition of the remaining stake in Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nAt the same time, other commissions income was down by 35%, mainly due to lower commissions in corporate finance and equity capital markets (ECM). Operating expenses rose by 8%, mainly driven by higher personnel costs due to an increase in fixed salary expenses and an increase in full-time equivalents (FTEs), primarily in the first half of the year.\n\nClient assets increased by 17% to \u20ac145.0 billion (2022: \u20ac124.2 billion), driven by net AuM inflows of \u20ac5.3 billion, the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform of \u20ac5.0 billion, and a positive market performance in AuM of \u20ac9.4 billion. Assets under administration grew by \u20ac1.2 billion, while savings and deposits showed a decrease of -\u20ac0.2 billion.",

The underlying result before tax of the Other segment was positive, and includes the book profit on the sale of our participating interest in Movares, offset by group function costs that are not allocated to the client segments.\n\nThe underlying result before tax for 2023 is the gross result adjusted for special items, namely expenses relating to the accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden, a release of provision for revolving consumer credit, restructuring charges relating to organisational changes, the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform and the integration with Mercier Vanderlinden.\n\nUnderlying result before tax by segment (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->",

Management fees increased by 11%, reflecting significant growth in AuM. This was a result of net inflows and a positive market performance in both our Private Clients and Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments, as well as the addition of Robeco's online investment platform from July 2023 onwards. Transaction fees were up by \u20ac4.3 million, driven predominantly by increased activity from our advisory clients. Other commissions decreased, mainly as a result of less corporate finance and ECM activity in our Investment Banking Clients segment.\n\nAnnualised recurring securities commission (run rate) was at a higher level compared with year-end 2022, because of the increase in AuM as well as higher margins at Private Clients. Annualised recurring fees are determined by multiplying the AuM on the reporting date by the management fee per client to determine the expected annualised management fee, assuming the AuM remains unchanged. The expected annual transaction fees relating to these client portfolios are then added to this number.\n\nAnnualised run rate securities commission income (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Interest\n\n| Interest (\u20ac million)                      |   2023 |   2022 |       |   H2 2023 |   H1 2023 |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Clean interest margin                     |  192.6 |  156.4 | 23 %  |      87.6 |     105   |\n| Loan commission                           |    1.9 |    1.7 | 11 %  |       0.9 |       1   |\n| Early redemption fees                     |    3.5 |    5.8 | -39 % |       0.5 |       3   |\n| Miscellaneous interest income and charges |   -1.5 |   -1.2 | -24 % |      -0.4 |      -1.1 |\n| Interest                                  |  196.5 |  162.7 | 21 %  |      88.6 |     107.9 |\n\nThe reporting year saw a further increase in key interest rates in the eurozone - a development that started in the second half of 2022. Our net interest income benefited, with 2023 interest income rising to \u20ac196.5 million, up 21% on the \u20ac162.7 million achieved in 2022. The interest charges related to medium-term notes rose from \u20ac2.8 million in 2022 to \u20ac19.1 million in 2023. Since 1 January 2023, these interest charges have been reclassified from \"Other income\" to \"Clean interest margin\". Comparative figures have not been restated.\n\nIn comparison with year-end 2022, the total interest margin (12-month moving average) improved by 32 basis points to an average of 124 basis points. The clean interest margin increased by 28 basis points compared with its level at the end of 2022, to 122 basis points at the end of 2023. During the reporting year, amounts in current accounts decreased, while term deposits showed strong growth. This development had a dampening impact on the interest margin due to the difference in client rates.\n\nPrivate Clients' 2023 commission income increased to \u20ac306.4 million (2022: \u20ac270.4 million) as a result of higher AuM and fee increases. Private Clients' margin on AuM remained stable at 63 basis points in 2023.\n\nWholesale & Institutional Clients' 2023 commission income increased slightly to \u20ac79.2 million (2022: \u20ac78.4 million). The margin for the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment was 11 basis points in 2023 (2022: 12).\n\nInvestment Banking Clients' 2023 commission income amounted to \u20ac36.5 million, which was significantly lower than in 2022 (\u20ac56.0 million), mainly due to fewer transactions for our real estate clients. The commission income from corporate finance and ECM deals was \u20ac25.7 million (2022: \u20ac44.7 million). The end of the year was marked by some green shoots and we were able to complete several deals for our clients. Other activities within investment banking, such as life sciences & healthcare, infrastructure & renewables and debt advisory, have grown year-on-year.",

        "page_content": "## Savings and deposits\n\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) raised the deposit rate through ten consecutive hikes that began from -0.5% in July 2022, reaching 2% in December 2022, and 4.0% in September 2023. Interest rates on client deposits gradually increased over the course of 2023, but lagged behind the ECB's rate hikes. Given our asset-liability mix and duration position, this led to higher interest income, especially in the first half of the year. In the second half, we further increased the savings rates for clients. We also offer a wealth management arrangement to private clients who invest with us, which enables them to hold savings at a more favourable interest rate.\n\nAverage savings and deposits volumes in 2023 were lower than in 2022. Client savings and deposits, mainly the amounts in current accounts, decreased in the first half of 2023 to \u20ac11.2 billion mainly due to conversion to AuM. However, the second half of the year showed steady volume growth (mainly in term deposits), with a spike in December leading to a year-end position of \u20ac12.6 billion (year-end 2022: \u20ac12.7 billion).\n\n## Loans\n\nOur total loan portfolio declined by \u20ac0.2 billion to \u20ac9.2 billion, partly due to lower mortgages and Lombard loan production as well as lower amounts in current accounts. Early redemption fees decreased further, driven by fewer prepayments as interest rates rose.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\n| Income from securities and associates (\u20ac million)   |   2023 |   2022 |      |   H2 2023 |   H1 2023 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------|-----------|-----------|\n| Dividend                                            |    6   |    4.4 | 38 % |       5.5 |       0.5 |\n| Realised capital gains                              |   23.6 |    7.2 |      |      23.6 |       0   |\n| Valuation gains and losses                          |    8.4 |   -3.7 |      |       3.2 |       5.3 |\n| Income from securities and associates               |   38.1 |    7.8 |      |      32.3 |       5.8 |\n\n| Income from, and book value of, securities and associates  (\u20ac million)   |   Income  2023 |   Income  2022 |   Book value  year-end 2023 |   Book value  year-end 2022 |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Van Lanschot Kempen Participaties (minority interests)                   |           28.4 |           10.1 |                        35   |                        47.8 |\n| Bolster Investment Co\u00f6peratief UA                                        |            3.9 |            6.3 |                        76.3 |                        63.1 |\n| Co-investments in own investment funds                                   |            5.2 |           -8.6 |                        83.8 |                       123.3 |\n| Other equity investments                                                 |            0.6 |            0.1 |                         2.1 |                         2   |\n| Total from securities and associates                                     |           38.1 |            7.8 |                       197.2 |                       236.2 |\n\nIncome from securities and associates relates to investments of our equity investment company, Van Lanschot Kempen Participaties, and our investments in Bolster Investments Co\u00f6peratief UA. We also take positions in our own investment funds - for instance, by providing seed capital or in order to align with our clients' interests.\n\nIn the second half of 2023, we sold our participating interest in Movares, which resulted in a book profit of \u20ac23.1 million. In 2022, a participating interest owned by private equity fund Newion I - in which we invest - was sold, which resulted in a book profit of \u20ac7.1 million.\n\nValuation gains and losses increased by \u20ac12.2 million to \u20ac8.4 million in 2023, reflecting the positive results in our private equity portfolio and higher results in our own investment funds compared with 2022.\n\nThe total result of our own investment funds amounted to \u20ac1.8 million (2022: \u20ac2.9 million), consisting of \u20ac5.2 million in income on our own investment funds driven by market performance, and a -\u20ac3.4 million negative result on hedges. The hedges are reported under Result on financial transactions (below). The book value of our own investment funds fell due to several divestments.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\n| Result on financial transactions (\u20ac million)   |   2023 |   2022 |       |   H2 2023 |   H1 2023 |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Result on securities trading                   |    1.7 |   -0.1 |       |       1.4 |       0.3 |\n| Result on currency trading                     |    7.6 |   11   | -31 % |       3.4 |       4.2 |\n| Result on investment portfolio                 |   -1.6 |   -3.2 | 49 %  |      -0.1 |      -1.5 |\n| Result on hedges                               |   -4.9 |   14.1 |       |      -2   |      -2.9 |\n| Other income                                   |   -1.7 |   -0.4 |       |       0.1 |      -1.8 |\n| Result on financial transactions               |    1   |   21.3 |       |       2.7 |      -1.7 |\n\nThe result on financial transactions decreased by \u20ac20.3 million, mainly driven by a poorer result on hedges. Firstly, the result on hedges includes a -\u20ac3.4 million (2022: \u20ac11.5 million) result on futures that are used to mitigate risk relating to our investments in our own investment funds. Secondly, hedge accounting ineffectiveness amounted to -\u20ac1.8 million (2022: \u20ac9.3 million). Lastly, this was offset by the hedging result applied to our structured products activities, which were -\u20ac0.1 million in 2023 (2022: -\u20ac6.2 million) because the derisking of the structured products portfolio was completed by year-end 2022.\n\nTrading activities in currency and securities are the result of client facilitation only - providing liquidity to clients.\n\nSince 1 January 2023, the interest charges related to medium-term notes of \u20ac19.1 million (2022: \u20ac2.8 million) have been reclassified from \"Other income\" to \"Clean interest margin\". Comparative figures have not been restated.",

In addition, staff costs were up as a result of the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform. The increase in FTEs was limited in the second half of the year, and resulted from converting external hires to internal employees.\n\nStaff costs also included a one-off end-of-year payment to all employees, amounting to \u20ac1.8 million in total.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses increased to \u20ac139.7 million (2022: \u20ac123.5 million), taking into account the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform. In addition, the other administrative expenses that increased compared with 2022 relate to technology/digitalisation, marketing/ communication, accommodation and consultancy.\n\n## Cost/income ratio\n\nThe cost/income ratio - i.e. the ratio of operating expenses (excluding costs incurred for special items) to income from operating activities - amounted to 71.6% (2022: 73.1%).\n\n## Impairments\n\n| Impairments (\u20ac million)          | 2023   |   2022 |       | H2 2023   | H1 2023   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Addition to loan loss provisions | 2.0    |   -7.7 |       | 3.9       | -1.9      |\n| Other impairments                | -      |    1.1 | -100% | -         | -         |\n| Impairments                      | 2.0    |   -6.6 |       | 3.9       | -1.9      |\n\n## Addition to loan loss provisions\n\nIn 2023, the addition to our loan loss provisions amounted to \u20ac2.0 million.\n\nAt year-end 2023, the management overlay amounted to \u20ac3.4 million (year-end 2022: \u20ac5.2 million), based on a calculation through which macroeconomic sensitivities and scenarios were applied at client level. This management overlay aims to reflect real client behaviour and the economic circumstances and uncertainties, which are not (fully) captured by the models. For more information about the management overlay, see Section 3.8.7, 'Management overlay', in the financial statements.\n\nIn 2023, the addition to loan loss provisions relative to average risk-weighted assets resulted in an addition of 5 basis points (2022: release of 19 basis points).\n\n## Other impairments\n\nWe had no other impairments in 2023. In 2022, other impairments amounted to \u20ac1.1 million for one of our office buildings.\n\n## Non-strategic investments\n\nWe currently hold one non-strategic financial investment, Allshare. The operating profit before tax from this nonstrategic investment amounted to \u20ac0.1 million in 2023 (2022: \u20ac0.6 million).\n\n## Special items\n\n| Special items (\u20ac million)                                         | 2023   |   2022 |       | H2 2023   | H1 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Amortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions       | 15.2   |   14.9 | 2%    | 8.1       | 7.1       |\n| Expenses related to accounting treatment of Mercier  Vanderlinden | 1.2    |   29.6 | -96%  | 0.6       | 0.6       |\n| Provision for revolving consumer credit                           | -0.3   |   -2   | 83%   | -0.3      | -         |\n| Restructuring charges                                             | 5.9    |    0.7 |       | 2.8       | 3.1       |\n| Other one-off items                                               | -      |    6.5 | -100% | -         | -         |\n| Special items                                                     | 21.9   |   49.8 | -56 % | 11.1      | 10.8      |\n\nWe recognised several special items in 2023, amounting to \u20ac21.9 million (2022: \u20ac49.8 million).\n\nAmortisation of intangible assets arising from acquisitions decreased in the first half of 2023, as a proportion of these were fully amortised, but increased again in the second half of the year due to the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform.\n\nIn December 2022, we agreed to accelerate the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. This led to an adjustment in the valuation of the contingent liability, resulting in expenses in 2022 in the line item Expenses related to accounting treatment of Mercier Vanderlinden, which would otherwise need to be recognised in future years. The expenses in this line item in 2023 comprised staff costs relating to the liability, amounting to \u20ac1.2 million.",

Assets under administration grew by \u20ac1.2 billion, while savings and deposits showed a decrease of -\u20ac0.2 billion.\n\n## Income tax\n\nIncome tax for 2023 amounted to \u20ac39.0 million (2022: \u20ac34.7 million), which translates to an effective tax rate of 23.8% compared with 29.1% in 2022. Our effective tax rate is lower than the general Dutch tax rate of 25.8%. This is primarily due to the book profit on the sale of our participating interest in Movares being subject to equity exemption rules, and only being offset by several nondeductible expenses.

The acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform contributed to a \u20ac5.0 billion increase in client assets.\n\nAt the end of 2023, discretionary assets under management accounted for 46% of total AuM (2022: 52%), amounting to \u20ac24.3 billion. Non-discretionary assets under management made up 45% of total AuM (2022: 38%), amounting to \u20ac23.7 billion, due to strong inflows in our advisory business and the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform. Total AuM also includes the positions of our private clients invested in our investment strategies (\u20ac4.4 billion).\n\nIn Belgium, we saw continued good net inflows of \u20ac0.8 billion in 2023. The positive market performance boosted the overall AuM to \u20ac11.3 billion (2022: \u20ac9.2 billion). Total client assets amounted to \u20ac12.5 billion (2022: \u20ac10.4 billion).\n\nOur Evi van Lanschot proposition is part of the Private Clients segment. In July 2023, the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform added \u20ac5.0 billion to the AuM of Evi van Lanschot. Total AuM of the combined Evi van Lanschot platform stood at \u20ac6.4 billion at year-end 2023.\n\n## AuM Private Clients (\u20ac billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Wholesale & Institutional Clients\n\nThe Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment's AuM increased by \u20ac7.8 billion to \u20ac75.1 billion at year-end 2023, coming from net inflows of \u20ac3.1 billion and a positive market performance of \u20ac4.7 billion. The net inflow was driven by fiduciary management and alternative investment solutions.\n\nInvestment strategies saw a net outflow of \u20ac0.2 billion, offset by a positive market performance of \u20ac0.8 billion. The net outflow was driven by small caps, and was only partly offset by inflows in credits.\n\nFiduciary management showed a net inflow of \u20ac2.8 billion, from both new fiduciary mandates and inflow from existing clients, as well as a positive market performance of \u20ac4.0 billion. In the UK, AuM increased to \u20ac6.1 billion (2022: \u20ac4.8 billion) thanks to the combination of net inflows of \u20ac1.0 billion and a positive market performance of \u20ac0.3 billion.\n\nIn 2023, asset class solutions was renamed as alternative investment solutions (AIS); with this change, private markets, farmland and private equity shifted from investment strategies to AIS. AIS involves the advice and selection of a wide range of illiquid asset classes for clients.\n\nAIS showed a net inflow of \u20ac0.5 billion, partly offset by a negative market performance of \u20ac0.2 billion. The new inflow mainly came from non-listed real estate, farmland and direct lending. Total AIS AuM amounted to \u20ac3.1 billion at year-end 2023 (year-end 2022: \u20ac2.8 billion).\n\nTotal client assets in the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment stood at \u20ac75.8 billion at year-end 2023.\n\nAuM Wholesale & Institutional Clients (\u20ac billion)\n\n<!-- image -->",

These mortgages are primarily granted to high net-worth individuals. The weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio is 64% (2022: 63%).\n\n## Other loans\n\nOther loans comprise loans to high net-worth individuals as well as commercial loans that fit into our Private Clients relationship model. In 2023, other loans fell to \u20ac2.2 billion (year-end 2022: \u20ac2.4 billion) mainly due to a decrease in current accounts.\n\n## Mortgages distributed by third parties\n\nThe portfolio of mortgages distributed by third parties consists of regular Dutch mortgages. It accounts for 4% of our total loan portfolio, with a volume of \u20ac348 million (2022: \u20ac373 million).\n\n## Other loans covered by residential real estate\n\nIn 2022, we invested in a fund managed by AEGON AM (formerly a.s.r. Vermogensbeheer NV). The investment is a dedicated tranche for Van Lanschot Kempen, which primarily consists of Dutch mortgage receivables with a Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG). The fund's purpose is to enable institutional parties to invest in Dutch mortgages. At year-end 2023, the volume in the fund amounted to \u20ac302 million (2022: \u20ac320 million).\n\n## Impaired loans and provisions\n\nWe take provisions for the impaired loans in our loan book. Impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) totalled \u20ac126 million at yearend 2023, and increased by 19% compared with 2022 (\u20ac106 million) mainly due to one exposure. The total impaired ratio deteriorated from 1.1% to 1.4% at the end of 2023.\n\nThe Stage 3 provisions for these loans amounted to \u20ac28 million, resulting in a coverage ratio of 22% (2022: 25%). The relatively low coverage ratio is explained by the good quality and amount of collateral pledged against the loans.\n\n| Provision as at 31/12/2023 (\u20ac million)          | Loan portfolio   | Impaired loans   | Provision   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2023   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2023   | Impaired  ratio  31/12/2022   | Coverage  ratio  31/12/2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Mortgages                                       | 6,368            | 27               | 2           | 0.4%                          | 8%                            | 0.4%                          | 6%                            |\n| Other loans                                     | 2,182            | 98               | 25          | 4.5%                          | 26%                           | 3.5%                          | 31%                           |\n| Loan portfolio                                  | 8,550            | 125              | 28          | 1.5%                          | 22%                           | 1.2%                          | 25%                           |\n| Mortgages distributed by third parties          | 348              | 1                | -           | 0.2%                          | 0%                            | -%                            | 2%                            |\n| Other loans covered by residential real  estate | 302              | -                | -           | 0.0%                          |                               | 0.0%                          |                               |\n| Total loan portfolio                            | 9,200            | 126              | 28          | 1.4%                          | 22%                           | 1.1%                          | 25%                           |\n| Provision                                       | -38              |                  | -           |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total                                           | 9,161            |                  | 28          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| ECL Stage 1 and 2 (IFRS 9)                      |                  |                  | 10          |                               |                               |                               |                               |\n| Total ECL (IFRS 9)                              |                  |                  | 38          |                               |                               |                               |                               |",

This decline is due to the capital return to shareholders of \u20ac85 million in December 2023, partly offset by issuing 1.7 million new shares as part of the accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden and adding retained profit. Total risk exposure amount (TREA) was up to \u20ac4.4 billion in 2023 (year-end 2022: \u20ac4.3 billion), driven by an increase in operational risk.

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2024, subject to regulatory approval. The intended acquisition is expected to result in a negative 0.4 percentage point impact on our CET 1 ratio.\n\nOn 1 January 2024, the legal merger between Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management and Van Lanschot Kempen (the acquiring entity) became effective. As a result of this merger, Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management ceased to exist as a legal entity. Van Lanschot Belgium's brand name changed to Mercier Van Lanschot on the same date.\n\nOn 22 January 2024, we launched and priced \u20ac100 million of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) notes with a fixed coupon of 8.875%. The notes are listed on Euronext Amsterdam. Settlement of these notes took place on 29 January 2024, and we intend to call our 2019-issued AT1 notes at the first call date of 1 April 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Risk and capital management\n\n## Key risk themes for Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nInterest rate risk: changing client behaviour in response to rising interest rates\n\nOver the course of 2023, the European Central Bank (ECB) further increased its deposit facility rate from 2% to 4%. Longer-term interest rates remained more or less unchanged. The resulting inverted yield curves had a substantial impact on clients' preferences. As clients now have the possibility to receive attractive deposit rates without having to lock up their funds for long maturities, we have seen a large shift from non-maturing deposits (savings and transactional accounts) into short-term deposits, with preferred maturities up to to six months. By December 2023, 25% of our client deposit base was made up of term deposits (compared with only 8% by the end of 2022). At the beginning of the year, we also saw flows from client deposits to fixed income assets under management (AuM), as low-risk fixed income yields exceeded our client deposit rates. In the last two months of the year, some clients switched their AuM back to savings rather than reinvesting the funds from maturing bonds.\n\nOperational risk: organisational complexity and change management Given our increasing AuM, the sophisticated nature of our business and the ongoing innovation of our investment management offering, our organisation can be labelled as complex. We strive to continuously reduce operational risks by simplifying processes, procedures and the organisation in general. Change may be driven by strategic developments, ever-evolving regulatory requirements and/or technological advances. Working on various major change projects simultaneously inherently leads to an increase in operational risks. In order to ensure the complete and timely achievement of project deliverables, managing resources across the project portfolio is important.\n\n## Compliance risk: organisational culture and ethical behaviour\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is exposed to compliance risk resulting from violations of regulatory requirements, industry standards or internal policies and procedures. Compliance goes beyond following rules and regulations: it involves fostering an ethical and responsible organisational culture that protects client-centricity, financial integrity and the interests of various stakeholders. Maintaining compliance standards relies heavily on ethical behaviour; the actions and decisions of everyone within the organisation can have significant consequences.\n\n## Sustainability risk: climate change and regulation\n\nWe are exposed to climate risk via our activities, including both physical and transition risks. Our main focus for on-balance sheet exposure is the residential mortgage portfolio, as this is the most significant position that is prone to climate risks. Given the geographical characteristics of the Netherlands, we are mainly exposed to flooding and drought risk (physical) as well as transition risks impacting the value of the collateral in the future, due to rising energy prices and/or rising renovation costs to meet future legislation. At present, the climate risks are found not to be material to Van Lanschot Kempen. The main risk for our AuM is to the holdings that will suffer as a result of the energy transition. Furthermore, implementing and adapting to sustainability-related regulatory developments remained one of our priorities in 2023, to ensure that we continue to protect our clients and inform them appropriately.\n\n## Risk management\n\n## Risk profile and risk appetite\n\nWe seek to achieve a solid risk profile - expressed in transparent risk levels coupled with a robust liquidity and capital position. The risks we face are outlined in the following sections. More detailed descriptions can be found in the financial statements, where these risks are also quantified in terms of their impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's balance sheet.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe increased client (term) deposit interest rates, to curb the conversion of deposits into fixed income AuM. As part of our regular interest rate risk management, we continuously monitor our exposure and any changes in client behaviour. We aim to recalibrate the models we use for hedging the interest rate risk in client deposits more frequently.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe address organisational complexity by ensuring clear terms of reference for various decision-making bodies. In 2023, we further implemented the so-called \"gating process\". This model had been developed for the execution of projects with an IT component, describing all phases and gates a project passes through. The gating process is now applicable to all material change initiatives. The gates are intended as \"go/no-go\" moments for steering committees and scrum teams.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nOur purpose, values and code of conduct serve as a guiding compass for our behaviour. To ensure our commitment to ethical behaviour, we have taken proactive steps to update our code of conduct. By incorporating ethical principles into our code of conduct and involving stakeholders in the process, we aim to empower our employees to make decisions that align with our organisation's identity and values. The updated version, launched in November 2023, is supported by a communication and implementation plan.\n\n## Mitigating actions\n\nWe made further enhancements to our stress-testing capabilities for both physical and transition risks. For our mortgage portfolio, we quantified the transition risks on the assumption that more stringent requirements on energy labels will be enforced via legislation and/or local regulation in the future. For physical risks, we used drought and property foundation data provided by national authorities and combined these with the collateral locations to derive stressed market values and possible effects on risk-weighted assets/capital. In addition, we expanded our risk analysis to provide insights into the sustainability profile of our liquid funds. In 2023, we also prioritised the timely implementation of sustainability-related regulations by conducting gap analyses, updating policies to incorporate new requirements, providing training, encouraging active discussions and advising on business implementation.\n\nWe evaluate our risk appetite annually, and this is communicated in a risk appetite statement containing both qualitative and quantitative elements. Our risk appetite represents our willingness to accept the risk of particular losses, decreasing buffers and reputational risks, and as such sets our operating boundaries. The statement is prepared by the Group Risk Committee, approved by the Management Board and, lastly, is also subject to the Supervisory Board's approval.",

        "page_content": "In 2023, we upgraded our risk appetite definition and the corresponding principles:\n\n- -As an organisation, we manage risks within our risk appetite. The aim is not to eliminate risks, because taking risks is part of the nature of doing business.\n- -Our risk appetite should be considered in all material decisions taken by the organisation.\n- -We only take risks that we understand and can explain.\n- -The risks we take - directly or indirectly - serve our business model and strategic objectives, and are the result of a careful process to balance risk and reward.\n- -After determining how much risk we can potentially absorb, we determine how much risk we are willing to take. The sum of all risks taken should not exceed our risk appetite.\n- -We actively avoid certain risks, because they pose an existential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen. However, risks in the tail will remain, which we have to accept.\n- -We avoid risks that could lead to legal or regulatory breaches. This includes not getting involved in activities that result in aiding or abetting clients with illegal activities.\n- -When taking risks, we take the requirements and expectations of all stakeholders into account.\n\nTargets and risk limits are more dynamic and are periodically reviewed, at least annually.\n\n## Risk management governance\n\nWe operate our risk management framework in accordance with the three lines of defence model. The management teams at individual departments (the first line) are responsible for managing their specific risks. When serving our clients, they must also assess client- and portfoliorelated risks, ensure they adhere to all Van Lanschot Kempen policies, limits and procedures, and put processes and controls in place to remain in control of their own operations.\n\nThe second line of defence is formed by Financial Risk Management, Non-Financial Risk Management and Compliance. Starting in January 2023, the Group Risk Management function was split into the Financial Risk Management department and the Non-Financial Risk Management department. The second line of defence reports to and advises the Management Board on all riskrelated matters. The second line also issues policies and provides guidelines on risk-taking activities, monitors adherence to these policies and guidelines, and challenges the first line on the management of their risks. Lastly, the second line supports management by facilitating and challenging risk assessments, and by providing relevant advice and assistance on applicable regulatory requirements and the design of controls and mitigating actions.\n\nThe Internal Audit department (the third line of defence) monitors and gives assurance on whether the activities of the first and second lines are effectively mitigating the risks identified.\n\nWe use insurance to cover certain remaining risks. Lastly, Dutch supervisors De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) as well as foreign supervisors (where applicable) check whether Van Lanschot Kempen adheres to laws and regulations and is in control of its own organisation.\n\nIn order to manage our risks, we have risk and compliance policies and frameworks in place as well as a governance structure. The Management Board remains responsible overall, but has delegated the management of specific risks to several committees: the Compliance & Operational Risk Committee, Sustainability Board, Credit Risk Committee, Market Risk Committee and Asset & Liability Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite and risk profile in 2023\n\nA risk dashboard and progress report are discussed by the Group Risk Committee every quarter, as well as by the Supervisory Board's Risk and Compliance Committee. Risktaking is inherent to our business model; low risks are not a means to an end. For a number of reasons, it may be appropriate to accept a higher risk - either temporarily or for a prolonged period. We always consider both gross and net - i.e. after mitigating measures - risk positions, paying extra attention to medium and high net risks.\n\nThe risk appetite and risk profile in 2023 for each individual risk type are shown in this simplified version of the risk dashboard:\n\n| Risk dashboard      | Low   | Limited   | Medium   | High   |\n|---------------------|-------|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Strategic risk      |       | \u00b7         | \u00b7        |        |\n| Operational risk    |       |           | \u00b7\u00b7       |        |\n| Compliance risk     |       | \u00b7         | \u00b7        |        |\n| Sustainability risk |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Credit risk         | \u00b7     | \u00b7         |          |        |\n| Market risk         |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Interest rate risk  |       | \u00b7\u00b7        |          |        |\n| Liquidity risk      | \u00b7\u00b7    |           |          |        |\n\nRisk profile in 2023\n\n- \u00b7 Risk appetite\n\n\u00b7\n\nClients entrust us with their funds on the basis that they have no doubt about the financial and operational stability of the organisation. We can therefore only operate at limited risk levels. However, certain risks are unavoidable and can only be mitigated to a certain extent. Those two risk appetites are classified in the dashboard as medium: strategic risk and operational risk. Strategic risk appetite is medium while competition in private banking, investment management and investment banking is strong. These risks can only be managed by actively optimising our results and through organic and/or inorganic growth. Given our increasing assets under management (AuM), the complex nature of the business and the continuing innovation of our investment management offering, this results in a medium level of operational risk appetite. Of course, we strive to continuously reduce operational risks by improving processes, procedures and the organisation in general.\n\nOur strategic risks can be managed by generating organic and inorganic growth to maintain the necessary scale for the future, and to retain solid performance. As a result of the acquisition and integration of both Mercier Vanderlinden and Robeco's online investment platform, coupled with strong organic growth in AuM and strong financial results, no issues arose in relation to strategic risk - hence a limited score for 2023.\n\nWe experienced some operational incidents (including external fraud attempts) and went through several large change projects in the reporting year. The overall risk profile for operational risk in 2023 is therefore categorised as medium.",

        "page_content": "Compliance risk appetite was limited, while the actual compliance risk profile in 2023 was medium. Timely implementation and embedding of regulatory requirements remains a challenge, given the increasing regulatory demands that impact our various business activities.\n\nOur sustainability risks were limited in 2023. The stress tests we performed did not show significant impact on balance sheet levels and other ratios.\n\nAll financial risk indicators (credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk) also scored well. We continue to operate under a tight limit framework, resulting in a limited appetite for both credit risk and market risk in 2023. A slight addition to loan loss provisions and low impairment ratios reflect our low credit risk in 2023. We observed a limited number of market risk breaches, despite lower thresholds than in 2022.\n\nOur interest rate risk profile (balance sheet composition) did not change significantly, but large interest rate increases and greater volatility called for heightened attention. Liquidity risk in 2023 remained low, due to our strong liquidity buffers. Liquidity buffers did show some decline at the beginning of the year, when our clients moved from lower yielding deposits and saving accounts into (short duration) fixed income instruments. Buffers rose quickly in the second half of 2023, after interest rates on deposits and savings accounts were raised.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is an independent, specialist wealth manager with the ambition to generate sustainable, profitable and scalable growth, while maintaining a capitallight balance sheet. We have a strong balance sheet and a good track record in transformation processes, including the integration of new acquisitions. This contributes to our solid reputation as a leading wealth manager in the Benelux region. To maintain our reputation, it's important to manage strategic risks. Strategic risk is defined as the risk to Van Lanschot Kempen's performance resulting from failure to respond adequately to changes in external factors or from poor strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities, as well as public opinion. Keeping up with technological developments, such as artificial intelligence (AI), is also a key topic on our strategic agenda.\n\nWe manage our strategic risk by diversifying our sources of income through our private banking, investment management and investment banking activities - thereby ensuring that the three activities are complementary and support each other. Moreover, our lending activities focus primarily on residential mortgages and our clients have sufficient buffers, thereby limiting our strategic risks in terms of credit and risks of forced liquidation of AuM. In the current market environment of relatively high interest and inflation rates, we are well prepared for a possible (shallow) recession in 2024. All our client segments performed without major credit losses in 2023. However, if confronted with a deep recession, all three client segments would be impacted. The expected increase in risk costs would be partly offset by net interest income and the recurring fees on AuM, resulting in some impact on our profit & loss (P&L). Even in such tough macroeconomic circumstances, a net positive P&L is expected. To manage our strategic risk in 2024, we must remain focused on our core activities and areas of expertise.\n\nWe use a range of performance indicators - such as growth in AuM, net result, cost/income ratio, Net Promoter Scores and employee engagement scores - together with a qualitative assessment to monitor and control strategic risk. Due to the challenging environment, in both economic and technological terms, our strategic risk appetite remains at a medium level going forward. The technological improvements we have made for our clients and to our internal processes over recent years show that we are continuously aware of, and acting to address, this challenge. Through our acquisitions in recent years, we are actively addressing the risk of consolidation in the sector, and are improving our economies of scale.\n\nLastly but importantly, we must maintain the capacity to meet all the specific regulatory requirements. This is demanding when operating various activities in multiple markets with different regulatory requirements. In the future, scale is of the essence: in general, regulatory costs do not increase in line with volume if work remains within the same kinds of activities.\n\n## Non-financial risks\n\nNon-financial risks comprise operational, compliance and sustainability risks.\n\nWe have defined a non-financial risk appetite. On a quarterly basis, the current non-financial risk exposure related to our non-financial risk appetite is discussed with members of the Management Board and senior management in the Compliance & Operational Risk Committee. In 2023, a new non-financial risk taxonomy was introduced, which will enable us to streamline our internal reporting as of 2024. The revised taxonomy is largely based on the operational risk reference taxonomy published by the Operational Riskdata eXchange Association (ORX) and forms the basis of our 2024 risk appetite framework for non-financial risk.\n\nRisk awareness within the company was raised both via increased capabilities within the first line of defence, and through challenges and advice from the second line of defence. We put increased focus on continuous monitoring of controls as well as on soft (behavioural) controls, while paying attention to effective and efficient action management. Compliance, Non-Financial Risk Management and Internal Audit work together on this.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are (potential) losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. To identify and manage operational and IT risks, we have created a group-wide operational risk management framework. Part of this framework is a set of key controls on the part of our value chains where inherent risks are deemed to be elevated. Controls are regularly tested, allowing us to assess the effectiveness of key controls in our processes and systems. In 2023, we improved our change processes by further implementing a \"gating process\" for material change initiatives. We also implemented a revised incident management procedure to ensure adequate logging and follow-up of various types of incidents. And we further standardised the way the second line of defence monitors key control effectiveness testing.",

        "page_content": "## Information risk\n\nPreventing cybercrime remains one of our key focus areas. Van Lanschot Kempen is aware of the risks concerning information security and cybercrime, and has further invested in technological and process-related measures to mitigate them. We continue to strengthen our security measures to keep pace with increasing cyberthreats and external fraud attempts, such as help desk fraud. We have a dedicated team that monitors security incidents in the organisation, including outside office hours, to ensure we have sufficient coverage to mitigate potential threats. We have teams that simulate cyberattacks and conduct penetration testing for security purposes, including periodic phishing awareness tests. We monitor the risks involved in cybercrime using risk dashboards via defined key performance and risk indicators. The metrics in the dashboard are overseen by the interdepartmental Information Security Board. Major issues related to cybercrime are reported directly to the Management Board.\n\nA key project that began in 2023 involves applying a zerotrust approach, resulting in a more secure environment. Reducing the availability and accessibility of sensitive data reduces the potential impact of cyberattacks, supplementing the measures in place to prevent them. Cybercrime risks such as ransomware have an ongoing focus within the business. Emerging risks in the field of AI continue to develop rapidly, and require us to ensure mitigating measures are in place.\n\nThe Digital Operational Resilience Act 2023 (DORA) brings harmonisation of the rules relating to operational resilience for the financial sector. To ensure we are compliant with the DORA by 1 January 2025, a taskforce involving all three lines of defence has been established to update the IT risk and control framework accordingly.\n\nIn order to maximise operational resilience during and after (potential) disruptions, threats and incidents, we have robust business continuity measures in place. These include a business continuity policy, governance structure with a Business Continuity Committee and Crisis Management and Support teams, as well as working instructions. Moreover, multiple tests are performed during the year to assess whether these measures work in practice. As a result, we were able to run critical systems from our back-up site for a period of more than a week, without any major disruptions.\n\n## Internal fraud\n\nInternal fraud occurs when fraud is committed as an intentional action by one or more employees in which deception or management override of controls is used, with the intent of gaining unlawful advantage for oneself or a personal acquaintance at the expense of others. Employees also include management, temporary workers, contractors, trainees and interns. Internal fraud conflicts with Van Lanschot Kempen's code of conduct, which provides guidelines to help ensure our reputation and integrity.\n\nMaintaining our reputation as a trustworthy financial institution is of great importance to Van Lanschot Kempen. Preventing and mitigating internal fraud risks is therefore a high priority, as these risks can lead to financial impact on our clients and our business. In addition, internal fraud can damage the public's trust in Van Lanschot Kempen's reputation and integrity as a financial institution.\n\nThe guidelines and processes for reporting and handling incidents are set out in our policy for handling integrity incidents.\n\nIncidents such as internal fraud cases are dealt with in accordance with the incident management procedure, which requires a root cause analysis to be conducted, as well as adequate follow-up to prevent reoccurrence. In 2023, no internal fraud, nor any attempt to commit internal fraud, was identified. As a result, no investigation of any person regarding internal fraud needed to be conducted.\n\nAssessing and mitigating internal fraud risk is an integral part of our risk & control framework. Internal fraud risk is assessed through risk control self-assessments on processes and through the Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA). The 2023 SIRA included various scenarios, such as the risk of employees stealing financial assets, physical assets or client data. The risk of employees executing unauthorised payments or credit transactions (as a result of insufficient segregation of duties or collusion) is also part of the risk assessment. The inherent risk of internal fraud in our overall risk assessment was evaluated as high: internal fraud can lead to substantial financial and reputational damage. However, effective control measures are in place to significantly reduce the risk. These control measures include the four eyes principle, access authentications, systemenforced checks on manual payments, and automated segregation of duties for payment systems. Our operating effectiveness is reviewed periodically by the first line of defence, with independent monitoring by the second line. Our Internal Audit department provides independent assurance on the quality of the risk control framework, applying a risk-based audit calendar.\n\nSeveral initiatives are in place to maintain awareness of internal fraud risk. Actions and priorities for continuous staff awareness and improvement are identified in the businessas-usual cycle. Staff training, starting with on-boarding for new employees that covers the code of conduct (including incident management), as well as periodic updates, are part of fraud mitigation measures.\n\nBased on the assessments conducted, the residual risk rating for internal fraud risk is categorised as limited, which is within our risk appetite. For more information about operational risk and internal fraud, see Section 11, 'Operational risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Investment compliance risk\n\nAs Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management manages clients' AuM, the risks resulting from these activities are reported as operational risks, as major errors could lead to potential claims from clients. We apply a uniform risk management approach and procedures across all activities. The risk management framework combines all relevant regulatory requirements for Van Lanschot Kempen. These include specific requirements for Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management: the Investment Firms Regulation (IFR), Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD) and Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS). The risk management framework describes how we identify, measure, manage and monitor all relevant risks to which our AuM are exposed. Quantitative and qualitative risk limits are set where possible on market, counterparty, liquidity and sustainability risks, and are described in the various risk policies.",

        "page_content": "All client portfolios are monitored against regulatory and investment guidelines (e.g. fund prospectuses and investment management agreements) on a daily basis. These guidelines provide restrictions on the main risk categories, i.e. market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and sustainability risk. When the Financial Risk Management department deems necessary, additional restrictions and/or more stringent restrictions are applied. There were no material findings from the investment compliance programme in 2023. Overall, our investment funds remained within the set risk limits throughout the year.\n\nIn addition to the investment compliance programme, Financial Risk Management performs periodic deep dives for portfolios managed by Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management. These consist of an in-depth analysis to assess whether the investment team manages the portfolio in line with the investment strategy, investment philosophy and client expectations. A holistic approach to portfolio risk management is taken, meaning that a broad range of metrics is assessed - including scenario analysis as well as consistency and alignment with sustainability targets, such as those set by the Paris Agreement. Results are discussed with investment teams and reported to the relevant stakeholders.\n\n## Compliance risk\n\nWhen operating in financial markets, it is important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, employees, shareholders and supervisory authorities. We also follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our shared values, code of conduct and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies, procedures and industry standards relevant for our business. Van Lanschot Kempen has established a compliance framework to manage compliance risks appropriately, to ensure business operations adhere to laws, rules and regulations, and to make sure we act in the best interests of our clients. In order to mitigate compliance risks efficiently and in line with (the spirit of) applicable rules and regulations, we focus on the continuous improvement of our policies, systems, processes and training and awareness, increasingly supported by the use of IT tooling and data analytics. The compliance framework applies across the entire organisation, including international locations.\n\n## International alignment\n\nSignificant progress has been made to improve the international alignment of the compliance framework across Van Lanschot Kempen, ensuring effective oversight of subsidiaries and branches. In 2023, we focused on enhancing international team collaboration and embedding the compliance processes. Compliance programmes have been aligned, including international group policies, driving consistency in the way of working. The set-up of the compliance risk & control framework is based on compliance risk assessments (according to the SIRA), executed for all business activities. Compliance risks stemming from business activities at the international locations are monitored and included in group compliance reporting.\n\n## Our code of conduct\n\nCompliance goes beyond following rules and regulations: it involves fostering an ethical and responsible organisational culture that protects client-centricity, financial integrity and the interests of various stakeholders. In 2023, the revision of our code of conduct was a group-wide project that involved\n\nclose collaboration between the Compliance, Human Resource Management and Communication, Brand & Corporate Reputation departments.\n\nOne key aspect was the active involvement of stakeholders: by engaging employees from various levels and departments, as well as clients and other stakeholders, we incorporated diverse perspectives and ensured that the code of conduct reflects our purpose and values. Our code of conduct outlines what we consider the essence of ethical behaviour and guides us to determine the right decisions. It is not an exhaustive list of rules, but commitments based on three ethical principles:\n\n- -We are respectful towards others\n- -We act with discretion\n- -We think across generations\n\nIn addition, our code of conduct is supported by various (compliance) policies and guidelines that provide further details about desired behaviour in daily practice. The revised code of conduct was launched in November 2023, underpinned by a communication and implementation plan, including dialogue sessions and a mandatory e-learning course. These initiatives will be periodically refreshed to continuously support ethical behaviour.\n\n## Financial crime risks\n\nFinancial and economic crime risks relate to money laundering, terrorist financing, sanctions, client tax integrity, and bribery and corruption. We believe that raising awareness and providing training for our staff are important elements in preventing financial and economic crime. We provide anti-financial crime training to employees who have contact with clients or are involved in detecting financial crime. Various additional training initiatives were launched in 2023, including client tax integrity awareness sessions with senior management and members of the Management Board, a sanction risk knowledge session and overall training related to client due diligence (CDD). Anti-bribery and corruption training was launched for client-facing staff to maintain risk awareness.\n\n## Client due diligence\n\nIn 2023, we updated several financial crime policies, such as our CDD policy, sanctions policy and client tax integrity policy, resulting in better integration of processes, while also reflecting the latest guidance from supervisors. To further strengthen the oversight of financial crime risks following the European Banking Authority guidelines, the necessary steps were taken to implement the role of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combatting the Financing of Terrorism Compliance Officer.\n\nWe continued to improve the efficiency of our CDD process by allocating the handling of CDD files belonging to specific investment banking and investment management client groups to a dedicated team. At the same time, we maintain our personal, client-focused approach and support our bankers in their responsibility for clients. This provides a strong basis to secure the necessary knowledge and overall effective handling of CDD files, which contributes to further mitigating financial crime risks. Furthermore, efforts to deploy a more risk-based approach within the CDD process are ongoing, following the \"From recovery to balance\" report by DNB. Applying a more risk-based approach ensures that measures to prevent and combat financial crime are proportionate to the risks identified.",

        "page_content": "## Client protection risks\n\nAs a wealth manager, we commit to safeguarding our clients' interests and providing fair, clear and relevant disclosures and marketing materials that are not misleading. Client protection risks relate to not treating clients fairly, such as providing them with products that do not meet their needs, objectives, (sustainability) preferences or risk appetite.\n\n## Implementing regulatory requirements\n\nIn response to new regulatory requirements, we have put several measures in place to ensure that we continue to safeguard our clients' interests and inform them appropriately about our products and services. Examples include the implementation of regulatory sustainability disclosures and the enhancement of the \"appropriateness test\". Furthermore, marketing of products and services to clients and client groups has been a focal point, especially regarding the integration of sustainability-related regulations, cross-border distribution of funds regulation and the branding project to further reflect the Van Lanschot Kempen brand across the entire organisation.\n\nThe Compliance department played an active role in the timely implementation of sustainability-related regulations. For more information, see \"Regulatory sustainability risk\" in the \"Sustainability risk\" section.\n\n## Mortgages\n\nOur goal is to enable our clients to make conscious decisions regarding their mortgages. In 2023, our policies, procedures and processes around mortgages were updated to reflect the latest AFM guidance. With the completion of the interest-only mortgages project, we have embedded the process of proactively approaching our clients to discuss their future financial situation - including the risks and possible solutions for the redemption of their mortgage into our day-to-day work. This enables clients to take timely measures, if necessary.\n\nFor more information about mortgages and the interest-only mortgages project, see \"Mortgage loans\" in the \"Financial risks\" section.\n\n## Business conduct risks\n\nWe are committed to upholding the integrity of the financial markets. We therefore manage business conduct risks via the compliance programme. Business conduct risks relate to conflicts of interest, market conduct, market abuse and employee integrity topics, such as secondary positions and personal account dealing (PAD). In 2023, several projects were initiated to further improve our existing processes to manage business conduct risks, including the revision of our code of conduct.\n\nWe enhanced the PAD tool for employees in 2023, further automating the requisite pre-clearance of employee orders, as well as the direct processing of restricted trading lists in the investment universe. The enhancements led to greater efficiency and reduction of manual labour in the PAD process.\n\nWe continued to work on the refinement, international alignment and implementation of our policy on the use of business devices, in light of our increasingly digital society. Within investment banking, we have made progress on revamping the processes for cross-border services and activities. We also provided specialist training to relevant staff on market sounding in relation to market conduct and market abuse.\n\n## Personal data integrity risks\n\nPersonal data integrity risks relate to data privacy, data retention and adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We operate a personal data integrity programme to protect the data of clients and employees, to support the organisation in its obligations and to foster awareness, as well as to establish internal policies, advise on data privacy matters and monitor compliance with data privacy laws. \"We act with discretion\" is one of the ethical principles underpinning our code of conduct: our adherence to the GDPR and the general discretion of employees is an ongoing priority and is integral to the service we offer as a wealth manager.\n\nIn the Compliance department, the Data Protection Officer (DPO) holds an independent position within the organisation and reports directly to the Management and Supervisory Boards.\n\nPersonal data integrity and emerging technological trends While our exposure to personal data integrity risks remained largely unchanged, the growing volume of data, the introduction of new technologies, and an increasingly digital way of working could potentially heighten the risk of data breaches. It is imperative for staff to know the do's and don'ts when processing personal data and to recognise potential risks. In 2023, we launched an e-learning programme for all staff about GDPR and data privacy.\n\nPersonal data integrity plays an important role in relation to emerging technological developments. Compliance and the DPO participated in the AI Centre of Excellence and advised on the behavioural and data privacy aspects of the implementation and use of AI within Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nFor more information about compliance risk, see Section 12, 'Compliance risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nWe identify sustainability risk as an additional overarching risk type that could potentially impact our own operations, the valuation of our balance sheet and our AuM activities. The management of sustainability risks is an integral part of our risk management framework and is therefore incorporated in our regular risk management processes. We also see that regulators have an increasing focus on reporting and managing sustainability risks.\n\nWe help our clients navigate sustainability transitions, with a primary focus on the energy transition and the vital shift towards a low-carbon economy, and a secondary focus on the food transition and limiting negative impact on biodiversity. As such, the main sustainability risks that affect our business cover both climate change-related risks - via either physical or transition risks (see table on the following page) - and biodiversity risk. However, our exclusion criteria also cover risks relating to social, labour and governance issues.\n\nThe wealth that we manage for our clients is inevitably exposed to risks associated with climate change and biodiversity to some extent, with the two being strongly interlinked. Our risk management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks, including sustainability risk. In 2023, we further increased our focus on nature-related dependencies, impacts and associated risks. This resulted, for example, in an update to our biodiversity policy.",

Within the internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP) framework that we developed, natural disasters such as flooding are included as a scenario.\n\nOut of our 28 Dutch offices, ten are located well above sea level and are not exposed to river flooding. From both a scenario analysis perspective and considering the risk of local offices flooding, the organisation will be able to function with most employees working from home or from another office location, given the number of office locations and employees not exposed to flood risks. Moreover, from experience over the past few years (since Covid), it is possible for the majority of staff to work from home without major disruption to business operations. Employees have been, and will continue to be, able to carry out their work with the required information and systems in such a scenario. We test this scenario once every three years.\n\nBoth of our data centres in the south of the Netherlands have low exposure to flood risk, located well above sea level in Eindhoven and 's-Hertogenbosch. In 's-Hertogenbosch, we have limited exposure to river flooding (expected once in 1,000 years), while our primary external data centre in Eindhoven has virtually no flood risk. To ensure we are able to operate if a data centre does fail, we perform an annual data centre fallback test, during which we assess whether the business can be operational within an acceptable timeframe in the event of a primary data centre failure. Combined with the ability to operate from home offices, the very low probability of both data centres failing simultaneously, and the low risks of sea and river flooding for all our offices or both our data centres, river and sea floods are considered to be immaterial from a business continuity perspective.\n\nA second external data centre - responsible for the automation, hosting and development platform of our main office applications - is located below sea level. A back-up location for this third-party facility is based in Ireland. In the event of a failure at the primary data centre, we intend to switch to the back-up data centre immediately.\n\nThe other categories of physical climate risks to our own operations are heatwaves, wildfires, storms, hail and hurricanes. The impact of these extreme weather events on our operations has been very limited in the past and is expected to remain limited going forward, especially compared with floods. Both likelihood and impact are therefore considered to be low.\n\n## Risk to our balance sheet\n\nWe calculate and report our balance sheet-related carbon emissions, mainly for mortgage loans, other loans and our investment portfolio. For our Private Clients segment, the most significant lending portfolio is our residential mortgage portfolio.\n\nIn 2023, we further improved our methods to estimate possible financial impact stemming from sustainability risks and to determine materiality. We created additional property-specific models to estimate drought and wildfirerelated climate impacts. A materiality framework was implemented to further increase objectiveness when assessing whether sustainability risks are material for Van Lanschot Kempen. Based on the assessment conducted of our balance sheet items, we conclude that there are no material climate risks to our business at present. There is currently no reason to apply a management overlay for this risk to the IFRS 9 models (Stages 1 and 2) as these risks are not considered to be material. In addition, the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team. If there are significant climate risks relating to our Stage 3 loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined. A management overlay for this risk is therefore not necessary for Stage 3.",

        "page_content": "Furthermore, we encourage our clients to improve the energy efficiency of their homes and other types of property we finance to reduce transition risks. For example, in our new mortgage offering, we offer our clients increasingly lower interest rates if the energy label of their property is C or better. We also provide additional lending room for clients who are looking to make their homes more sustainable and energy-efficient. We believe that, in the future, less energy-efficient homes will go down in value, posing a potential risk for Van Lanschot Kempen and its clients, though at present this is non-material.\n\nOur responsible lending policy takes environmental and social impact into consideration. This policy covers periodic sustainability screening (due diligence), via a risk filter, of all existing and new business loans, and includes factors such as human rights, social and labour issues, environment, anticorruption and bribery. During 2023, the screening did not identify any new material sustainability issues in the portfolio. The number of potentially high-risk borrowers (clients active in sectors associated with a higher risk of human/labour rights violations or environmental pollution) totalled only one at year-end 2023 (the same as in 2022). We continue to engage with the remaining high-risk borrower about specific sustainability risks and how they could be mitigated. For more information on how Van Lanschot Kempen handles responsible lending, see the policy on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/ sustainability-policies-and-resources.\n\nWe assess financial institutions with which Van Lanschot Kempen has a banking relationship on an annual basis. This assessment aims to prevent the risk that client assets are exposed - through interbank loans or investments, for example - to institutions with weak or non-existent sustainability policies. We check whether financial institutions have committed to more than 50% of nine wellknown international sustainability initiatives, at a minimum. If not, we start an engagement process with the institution. Our 44 financial institution counterparts all currently comply with this policy. In 2023, there was no need to engage with any financial institutions in our portfolio on this matter.\n\nTo support our own investment funds, we provide seed capital and manage these funds in our management book. At year-end 2023, we had investments to the tune of \u20ac79.1 million in our funds, with 46.2% invested in Article 8 and 12.4% invested in Article 9 funds respectively, as categorised under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR). An internally developed stress test showed that climate risks in these positions are limited and well within our regular limits.\n\nWe also continued to enhance our dataset and monitor activities relating to the sustainability objectives of our own organisation, balance sheet and AuM, in order to establish a more accurate and dynamic overview of the (potential) impact of our actions on the environment. Lastly, we have been working to further embed and integrate sustainability elements in all our core processes, controls, product development, policies and reporting.\n\n## Regulatory sustainability risk\n\nIn November 2020, the ECB set out its expectations on mitigating climate-related and environmental risks by financial institutions. Van Lanschot Kempen takes an active approach to complying with these expectations and is on track for implementation via our multi-year programme.\n\nIntroduced in 2021, the SFDR aims to provide greater transparency to investors about the sustainability claims and performance of investment products. Investment funds can either promote environmental and/or social characteristics (Article 8 disclosure) or have the objective to invest in sustainable investments (Article 9 disclosure). Funds that do not take sustainability into account are classified as Article 6.\n\nIn 2023, we further enhanced our sustainable investment definition, which allows us to follow a rule-based and datadriven process around determining whether an individual investment can be regarded as sustainable within the meaning of the SFDR. We also prioritised the timely implementation of sustainability-related regulations. We made further progress on updating our documentation and enhancing our data processes as part of the SFDR and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).\n\nThe Sustainability Regulation Change Group played an active role in conducting gap analyses of new sustainability regulations, updating policies to incorporate new requirements, encouraging active discussions and advising on business implementation. In response to new regulatory requirements, we have implemented several initiatives to ensure that we provide our clients with relevant and appropriate information and make the necessary regulatory sustainability disclosures.\n\nTo help clients make investment decisions, we must provide them with relevant and accurate information and consider their sustainability preferences. In 2023, we reached out to most of our clients to ask them about their sustainability preferences. An e-learning course on sustainability preferences and disclosures was introduced for client-facing employees to support these efforts. In addition, we further revised our processes in order to monitor whether clients' portfolios adhere to their preferences and to meet sustainability reporting requirements - in accordance with amendments to MiFID II and the SFDR respectively.\n\nBy the end of the 2023, we had identified and categorised the sustainability preferences of most of our clients into three standard profiles:\n\n- 1. Neutral ( Neutraal );\n- 2. Committed ( Betrokken );\n- 3. Very committed ( Zeer betrokken ).\n\nIn accordance with the SFDR, we offer an increasing minimum share of sustainable investments and use additional/stricter exclusion criteria. In 2023, we also provided virtually all our clients with insights into the sustainability profile of their portfolios, in accordance with the SFDR post-contractual reporting requirements.\n\nWe expect ongoing attention from supervisory authorities on sustainability and impact claims, with stricter guidance on fund names and fund communication. More changes to the SFDR will unfold over the next several years, following the outstanding consultations. We aim to stay on top of the regulatory sustainable finance agenda and use it as a positive driver for our company.",

        "page_content": "## Risks to our assets under management\n\nIn our AuM activities, climate change and nature-related risks are taken into account when investments are made or investment managers are selected.\n\n## Climate\n\nAs part of our responsible and sustainable investing approach, we have a climate change policy that we have improved over the years. In line with the Paris Agreement, we have set targets on reducing the carbon emissions of our investment funds to be met by 2025, 2030 and 2050 enabling us to cope with the transition risks related to climate change. This also enhances resilience to physical climate change risks, as the companies in these investment funds will take climate change into account.\n\nAs physical risks will likely materialise more in certain regions and sectors (with physical assets) than others, we gather physical climate data down to asset level for our real estate portfolios from a specialist climate data provider. We use climate scenarios for most of our managed global and European listed portfolios to assess their climate resilience compared with the benchmark. We also use climate change risk indicators (proxies) from our climate data provider for several internal funds and some large clients. We have integrated climate change mitigation into our current asset allocation scenarios via GDP assumptions (i.e. scenarios ranging from 1.5\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C of global heating). And we have incorporated DNB's climate stress test for the equity market into our risk system.\n\nIn 2023, we further expanded our risk analytics to provide insights into the sustainability profile of our managed listed portfolios. We developed environmental, social and governance (ESG) and carbon emissions monitoring tools, which allow us to challenge portfolio managers on whether their investment decisions are in line with the investment strategy and whether the portfolio is on track to meet the annual targets to reduce carbon emissions. Several ESG ratings are tracked through time on an absolute and relative (to the benchmark) basis. The benchmark-relative scores are assessed for practical and statistical significance. Moreover, we keep track of the upgrades vs downgrades and discuss possible actions regarding investee companies that appear on the watch list.\n\n## Nature\n\nRisks resulting from nature-related dependencies, impact, risks and opportunities are especially relevant to our AuM, and we aim to review these risks when making investment decisions on behalf of our clients.\n\nIn alignment with the Finance for Biodiversity Pledge that we signed in 2023, we have set a target to engage with companies with controversies related to biodiversity, as well as entities for which we consider this topic to be material but not controversial.\n\nDue to the links between climate change and biodiversity, the steps we have taken in addressing climate change risks also have a positive impact on managing nature-related risks. As part of our investment process, we consider biodiversity dependencies, impact, risks and opportunities through four instruments: exclusion, ESG integration, active ownership and impact. Through these four instruments, we aim to cease (via exclusion and active ownership), prevent or mitigate our adverse biodiversity impact (via ESG integration and active ownership) and contribute to positive solutions (via impact).\n\nOne example is our proprietary ESG risk score for our core investment strategies, which includes elements tied specifically to nature-related impacts.\n\nOne of the main challenges is that not all companies disclose sufficient data and information on their sustainability risk exposure. As more information is disclosed by companies, we plan to gain more insight into our exposure to naturerelated dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities to be able to determine our resilience against these. In our engagements, we will focus on a selection of industries that are highly dependent on biodiversity or contribute significantly to biodiversity loss, with a specific emphasis on deforestation. Collaboration with other financial institutions plays a vital role in this. We have formed a partnership with the Partnership for Biodiversity Accounting Financials (PBAF) in which we contribute and exchange knowledge in various working groups.\n\nFor more information on our approach to help limit and reverse biodiversity loss, see our biodiversity policy on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-policiesand-resources.\n\n## Additional information: TCFD and TNFD\n\nIn line with 2022, this section covers how we implemented the recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). In addition, we have expanded it with information about how we address risks of nature-related dependencies in accordance with the recommendations of the Taskforce on Naturerelated Financial Disclosures (TNFD).\n\nTargets, processes and risks can only be efficiently addressed by an effective governance structure. Our Management Board has allocated the responsibility for setting sustainability risk policies, frameworks, appetite, tolerance levels and monitoring to the Sustainability Board (chaired by the Chair of the Management Board). One of the subcommittees of the Sustainability Board is the Sustainability Investment Council, which specifically focuses on the management of sustainability risks for our AuM. The Sustainability Board and Sustainability Investment Council are supported and advised by our Corporate Sustainability team and Sustainable & Impact Investing team respectively. In order to efficiently build capacity in reducing our indirect biodiversity impact and in managing risks of nature-related dependencies, we formed a biodiversity working group with representatives from various investment management activities. For more information on how we organise sustainability, see our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-governance-structure.\n\nWe leverage our experience in managing human rights issues, as severe biodiversity impacts often affect indigenous peoples and other local communities in particular. We have policies in place to monitor compliance with global standards such as the UN Global Compact principles and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We also conduct screenings to assess human rights impact on local communities of investee companies. If credible third-party research indicates links to forced labour, discrimination or illegal activities, we engage with the companies, escalate if necessary and consider adding them to our exclusion list if their response is deemed insufficient. For more information on our human rights and labour rights policy, see: vanlanschotkempen.com/sustainability-policies-and-resources.\n\nThe risk management process as well as the roles and responsibilities around managing sustainability risks are further detailed in our groupwide sustainability risk policy, which focuses mainly on physical and transition risks as a result of climate change.",

        "page_content": "## Financial risks\n\nFinancial risks comprise credit, market, model, interest rate and liquidity risks. These risks are managed by various committees: the Credit Risk Committee (CRC), Market Risk Committee (MRC), Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) and Group Risk Committee (GRC). All these committees approve policies, which outline the main boundaries for the financial risks we accept.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nOur credit risk is considered to be limited. Our loan portfolio amounts to \u20ac9.2 billion and has manageable risks; 69% of the loan portfolio consists of the Private Clients segment's Dutch residential mortgage loans. We aim to keep the size of this portfolio at least constant (or with modest growth) by generating enough new business to offset repayments and prepayments. New mortgages are primarily provided to private clients who also hold AuM with us. Due to rising interest rates, the generation of new loans was significantly lower in 2023 than in the peak years of 2021 and 2022.\n\nCredit quality remained stable in 2023, while loan losses were still very limited. There has been no direct impact on our portfolio from the war in Ukraine, nor from the IsraelHamas war. In order to monitor and measure credit risks for most of our loan portfolios, we use sophisticated risk models: an internal ratings-based (IRB) approach. For regulatory reporting, we use only our residential mortgages IRB model. Our loan portfolio and credit risks are concentrated in the Netherlands (92%); lending in Belgium and Switzerland is limited, and mainly consists of Lombard loans with low risk profiles.\n\nLoan portfolio, excluding provision (100% = \u20ac9.2 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAlthough our exposure to the Dutch housing market is fairly significant, the concentration risk on single line items in the overall loan portfolio is relatively limited. The ten largest loans to individual counterparties, other than financial institutions, totalled \u20ac179 million at year-end 2023, compared with \u20ac227 million at year-end 2022. 1 In 2023, the credit risk limits on the ten largest loans to individual counterparties decreased, as well as the use of credit by these individual counterparties. At year-end 2023, 97.7% of the Dutch loan portfolio consisted of loans of less than \u20ac10 million (year-end 2022: 96.9%).\n\nOur policy is to keep credit risk limits on any single debtor at an acceptable level in order to contain concentration risk and to mitigate its potential impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's results. For more information, see Section 3.5, \"Concentration within the loan portfolio\", in the financial statements.\n\n## Mortgage loans\n\nAt year-end 2023, 69% of our loan portfolio consisted of the Private Clients segment's residential mortgages. Our portfolio differs from that of other Dutch mortgage lenders in that the average loan (approximately \u20ac577,000) is larger. This makes the portfolio a little more sensitive as more expensive properties tend to be more difficult to sell in uncertain circumstances. However, the majority of our exposure is in urban areas - generally a more liquid segment of the housing market. In 2023, house prices in the Netherlands decreased overall, though they picked up slightly towards the end of the year. The portfolio's weighted average loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, based on foreclosure value, increased slightly to 64% at year-end (year-end 2022: 63%). New issuances are, in general, issued for LTVs between 50% and 90%. Our methodology for determining the LTV of residential mortgages is based on the indexed foreclosure value. This methodology is in line with the generally accepted norms for LTV determination.\n\nIn 2020, we started our interest-only mortgages project, the aim of which is to enable clients to make conscious choices about their interest-only mortgages. For example, we actively assist clients with potentially declining incomes (e.g. due to retirement) to limit the risk of not being able to pay off their loans at maturity date. To this end, we provide insights into the status of their mortgage and its future affordability and flexibility. In line with guidelines from the AFM, in 2023 we incorporated this activity in our regular review processes for residential mortgages. In this way, we increase awareness among clients and try to avoid potentially difficult situations. We also updated our credit granting policy to comply with the guidelines laid down by AFM in their sector letter of July 2022. 2\n\n## Energy labels of homes with residential mortgages\n\nAt year-end 2023, 48.5% of homes with mortgages had an A, B or C energy label (year-end 2022: 47.8%). Due to the nature of our client base, a substantial percentage of homes still have D, E, F or G energy labels. If no label is available, an estimate is derived from the year of construction of the property. Over the course of 2023, we were able to improve our data quality and reduce the number of missing energy labels.",

In the same category are commercial activities that fit into our Private Clients' relationship model, such as funding investments for family businesses, business professionals, healthcare professionals and entrepreneurs. These kinds of loans are supplementary to our wealth management strategy and typically involve the client bringing in AuM. Our aim is to keep the size of this portfolio stable.\n\nStarting in 2021, we began reporting our corporate banking loan portfolio in this category as well. The winding down of this portfolio continued in 2023, and it now amounts to \u20ac70 million (2022: \u20ac79 million).\n\n## Other loans: type of loan (100% = \u20ac2.2 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Real estate loans\n\nOur real estate loans, both those provided to private clients and corporate banking's legacy portfolio, amount to \u20ac325 million (2022: \u20ac353 million). 3 These loans are provided primarily on the basis of a total quality assessment of the borrowers. We also take into account the quality and sustainability of the property, and the diversification and stability of the rental flows. The debt service coverage ratio\n\n(DSCR) is calculated so that we can determine the extent to which a client will be able to make interest and principal payments from the rental income generated by their commercial real estate. At year-end 2023, 91% of our real estate loans generated sufficient rental income to cover interest and principal payments - i.e. had a DSCR of over 1 (year-end 2022: 91%). Clients with a DSCR of less than 1 often have other income-generating assets they can use to service their loan obligations. Lastly, the LTV of real estate loans improved over the year as a result of regular redemptions. Over half of the portfolio consists of residential real estate loans; this market is very stable. A quarter of the portfolio consists of real estate loans collateralised by offices; this market is still cooling down and average prices decreased further in 2023. However, the credit quality of our real estate loans portfolio remained stable.\n\n## Other mortgage exposure\n\nWe provide mortgages through a network of intermediaries, branded as Hypotrust and with Quion as our service provider for our white-label mortgages. We have built up a white-label portfolio with good risk characteristics and with very few loan losses. The size of the portfolio amounted to \u20ac348 million by year-end 2023 (year-end 2022: \u20ac373 million) and makes up 4% of the total loan portfolio. This portfolio is no longer open to new borrowers.\n\nWe have invested in a separate account mortgage fund managed by AEGON AM (formerly ASR Vermogensbeheer NV). The purpose of the fund is to make it possible for institutional parties to invest in Dutch mortgages. The investment amounted to \u20ac302 million at year-end 2023 (year-end 2022: \u20ac320 million) and is a dedicated tranche for Van Lanschot Kempen, which consists primarily of Dutch mortgage receivables with a Dutch national mortgage guarantee (NHG). The credit risks are limited due to the NHG. We only run a small amount of credit and operational risk if the NHG claim procedures are not completed correctly by ASR Levensverzekering NV.",

        "page_content": "## Impaired loans\n\nImpaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) are defaulted loans in IFRS 9 credit quality Stage 3. The impact of the war in Ukraine (i.e. considerable impact on energy and commodity prices) on our portfolios was closely monitored throughout the year. At year-end 2023, this impact was once again limited. This is mostly due to the composition of the portfolio, with mainly mortgages and very limited business loan exposure, coupled with most of our private clients having significant financial buffers.\n\nImpaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) totalled \u20ac126 million at yearend 2023, and increased by 19% compared with 2022 (\u20ac106 million). Impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) accounted for 1.4% of the loan portfolio at year-end 2023 (year-end 2022: 1.1%). In 2023, a provision equal to 22% of impaired loans Stage 3 (IFRS 9) was taken (2022: 25%), resulting in specific provisions totalling \u20ac27.7 million.\n\n## Loan loss provisions\n\nIn 2023, we added \u20ac0.8 million in Stage 3 provisions (in 2022, we released \u20ac7.7 million) driven by a few individual client files. At year-end, Stage 3 provisions amounted to \u20ac27.7 million. Over the course of 2023, we saw a decrease in exposures in Stage 1, a slight increase in exposures in Stage 2, and an increase in exposures in Stage 3. At year-end 2023, the management overlay amounted to \u20ac3.4 million (year-end 2022: \u20ac5.2 million), based on a calculation through which macroeconomic sensitivities and scenarios were applied at client level. This management overlay aims to reflect real client behaviour and the economic circumstances and uncertainties, which are not (fully) captured by the models. For more information about loan loss provisions, see Section 3.8.7, \"Management overlay\", in the financial statements.\n\nFor more information about credit risk, see Section 3, 'Credit risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Market risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is exposed to market risk through client-facilitating transactions. Our Treasury department performs equity/interest rate structured products transactions for clients. Our Investment Banking Clients team performs equity transactions for clients and provides market liquidity, which may result in trading positions. Our Treasury department performs transactions in interestrelated and foreign currency products. These activities may also result in trading positions. Temporary positions may arise from our efforts to facilitate our clients' requests. We invest in our own funds in order to align our interests with those of our clients and to support our investment management activities via seed capital in newly launched funds.\n\nFinancial markets in 2023 were challenging and volatile due to higher inflation than was anticipated by policymakers. In response, policy rates were rapidly increased, resulting in higher interest rates. This led to a couple of banks defaulting, volatile equity valuations and lower bond prices. At the same time, the war in Ukraine continued, while the war between Israel and Hamas added to negative sentiment in the financial markets. All three business activities exposed to market risk (structured products, equity brokerage and other treasury positions) showed relatively stable returns, a limited number of limit breaches and low capital usage, all despite volatile markets.\n\nFor further information on market risk, see Section 4, 'Market risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Model risk\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen uses models for a variety of purposes, ranging from quantification of the various risk types to supporting decision-making in the business. The use of models exposes Van Lanschot Kempen to model risk, as models are a simplification of reality and are based on assumptions. Further sources of model risk can be found in model choice appropriateness, model implementation and the use of model outcomes.\n\nTo mitigate model risk, we apply the three lines of defence model. The first line of defence is formed by the model owners, whose primary role is to identify, assess and manage the risks associated with models throughout their lifecycle. The second line of defence is model risk management, carried out by the Model Validation department, which is responsible for performing independent validations and maintaining the model risk management framework (MRMF) and related policies in line with regulatory requirements. The Internal Audit department acts as the third line of defence, providing an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the model risk management process.\n\nA risk-based approach is adopted in line with the MRMF by assigning a tier to each model. The model tier is a reflection of the model risk associated with a model, and is determined on the basis of model complexity and the materiality of potential model errors. Those models containing more model risk will be validated more frequently and in more depth than models containing less model risk.\n\nA complete inventory has been made of all models within Van Lanschot Kempen. Model Validation reports to various committees, including the Group Risk Committee, on the status of model risk and the outcomes from model validations.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nOver the course of 2023, the ECB increased its deposit facility rate further, from 2% to 4%. Longer-term interest rates remained more or less unchanged. The resulting inverted yield curves had a substantial impact on client behaviour. As clients now have the possibility to receive attractive deposit rates without having to lock up their funds for long maturities, we have seen a large shift from nonmaturing deposits (savings and transactional accounts) into term deposit rates, with preferred maturities up to six months. By December 2023, 25% of our client deposit base was made up of term deposits (compared with only 8% by the end of 2022).\n\nOn the loan side, we observed a substantial decline in early redemptions (prepayments) on mortgages, as a result of increased market rates. For the vast majority of our mortgage book, clients' current interest rates are lower than prevailing interest rates for new mortgages. In some cases, effective mortgage rates are even lower than prevailing term deposit rates. This greatly reduces clients' incentive to prepay on their mortgages. We also observed an increase in clients using their right to take their current mortgage interest rates with them when moving house (under certain conditions).",

        "page_content": "The increased client preference for term deposits (on which our margins are generally less favourable than on savings), had an effect on our net interest income. Although net interest income is still a lot higher than it was during the low interest rate era, it appears that net interest income peaked in the first half of 2023.\n\nIn the reporting year, our ALCO maintained a positive interest rate mismatch position. This can be represented by duration of equity, which was kept within a two- to six-year range. Despite ongoing interest rate volatility, we remained well within all interest rate risk limits.\n\nFor more information on interest rate risk, see Section 7, 'Interest rate risk', in the financial statements.\n\n## Liquidity and funding risk\n\nDuring 2023, our client deposit base decreased slightly, from \u20ac12.7 billion in 2022 to \u20ac12.6 billion in 2023. This is mainly due to a substantial conversion of client deposits into fixed income AuM in the first quarter, which in turn could be attributed to returns on low-risk fixed income investments (sovereign bonds) being higher than savings and term deposits offered at the time. In the last two months of the reporting year, some clients also switched their AuM back to savings rather than reinvesting the funds from maturing bonds.\n\nOur December 2023 loan-to-deposit ratio amounted to 72.9% (2022: 73.6%), which reflects the fact that our client deposit base well exceeds our client loan book volume.\n\n## Funding mix (100% = \u20ac16.8 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBecause of this, our reliance on other funding sources is limited, and our liquidity risk profile is mostly driven by the potential occurrence of unanticipated deposit outflows. Although our deposit base has proven to be sticky over time, there is always a risk of unexpected outflows, particularly for balances not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme.\n\nAs our appetite for liquidity risk is low, we aim to hold solid liquidity buffers that would allow us to absorb severe unexpected liquidity stress situations. Outcomes of liquidity stress tests, which cover acute and persistent liquidity stress, are discussed by our ALCO on a monthly basis. Due to our strong liquidity buffer, stress test outcomes and other liquidity indicators such as the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR) remained well above limits throughout the year. At year-end 2023, our liquidity buffer was substantial, as the LCR and NSFR stood at 224.7% and 156.4% respectively (2022: 178.3% and 158.1%).\n\nAlthough our loan-to-deposit ratio is well below 100%, we aim to keep a degree of diversification in our funding mix in terms of funding type and maturity, by supplementing the client deposit base with covered bonds. We substantiated this policy by issuing a \u20ac500 million covered bond in May 2023 to replace a maturing covered bond. This bond was issued under the Soft Bullet Covered Bond programme, which was established in 2022 and had replaced the public Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond programme by the end of 2023. Total outstanding volume under the covered bond programme was \u20ac1.5 billion by December 2023. Moreover, outstanding volume in the retained covered bond programme was \u20ac500 million. In addition, we have around \u20ac466 million in structured debt instruments. We do not have any benchmark-size unsecured debt issuances placed with investors. The redemption profile of our capital markets debt and capital instruments is outlined below.\n\nFunding and capital instruments redemption profile (\u20ac million)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Liquidity and investment portfolio composition\n\nOur liquidity buffer (excluding retained own debt instruments) totalled \u20ac6.3 billion at year-end 2023, compared with \u20ac6.2 billion at year-end 2022. We held \u20ac2.7 billion at the ECB deposit facility, as this still offers a more favourable rate than other low-risk investments such as Dutch or German sovereign bonds.\n\nOur investment portfolio (liquidity buffer minus central bank deposits) is maintained primarily for liquidity purposes, and consists mainly of liquid, low-risk instruments, in line with our investment policy. In 2023, the composition of the portfolio shifted slightly due to market conditions and client behaviour. There are strict limits on instrument types, counterparties, countries, ratings and credit spread risk.\n\nWe hold part of our investment portfolio in a book that is classified at amortised cost (hold to collect). In the unforeseen event that we would have to liquidate this book, the expected impact on P&L would be around negative \u20ac3 million (as at 31 December 2023).\n\nIn addition to day-to-day portfolio management, we periodically review and annually report on our investment portfolio to ensure it meets our ESG criteria. We have not encountered any material sustainability issues in our investment portfolio to date.",

Excess equity capital has been used for acquisitions and distributed to shareholders via equity capital returns. Our Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio target is 15% plus a 2.5% add-on for acquisitions. In December 2023, we returned \u20ac2.00 per share (approx. \u20ac85 million) to shareholders. Our intention to return capital above our target to our shareholders going forward, subject to regulatory approval, remains unchanged.\n\nOur CET 1 target ratio is well above the CET 1 requirement that stems from the supervisory review evaluation process (SREP). The latest SREP, which was concluded in August 2023, and overall capital requirements are outlined in the table below. Required CET 1 capital is 7.35% for Pillar 1 and 2 risks. Relative to the previous SREP, Pillar 2 guidance has increased from 0.24% to 1.06%. This increase relates to DNB's revised approach to account for stress test outcomes. However, the impact of stress scenarios on our solvency has not changed materially.\n\nCombined buffer requirements (countercyclical and capital conservation buffer) currently require 3.5% CET 1 capital. DNB has indicated that the countercyclical buffer will increase from the current 1% to 2% by the end of 2024. Our year-end capital ratios well exceed overall capital requirements (including a 2% countercyclical buffer) and our own targets.\n\n| SREP and overall capital  requirements from August 2023  (%)   |   CET 1 |   Tier 1 |   Total  capital |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|----------|------------------|\n| Pillar 1                                                       |    4.5  |     6    |             8    |\n| Pillar 2                                                       |    2.85 |     3.8  |             5.06 |\n| Total SREP capital requirement                                 |    7.35 |     9.8  |            13.06 |\n| Capital conservation buffer                                    |    2.5  |     2.5  |             2.5  |\n| Countercyclical capital buffer                                 |    1    |     1    |             1    |\n| Pillar 2 guidance                                              |    1.06 |     1.06 |             1.06 |\n| Overall capital requirement                                    |   11.91 |    14.36 |            17.62 |\n| Capital ratios at year-end 2023                                |   19.6  |    21.9  |            25.3  |\n\nSince we are not classified as a \"resolution institution\", our loss absorption requirements (minimum required eligible liabilities - MREL) are equal to prevailing SREP requirements.\n\nAs DNB is concerned about systemic risk in the Dutch housing market, it has implemented a risk weight floor for residential mortgages. This floor applies to mortgages not guaranteed by the NHG that are capitalised based on the IRB approach, and came into effect on 1 January 2022. Due to our solid mortgage portfolio, which results in low IRB risk weights, the impact of this floor is relatively large (-2.6 percentage points CET 1 ratio as at 31 December 2023). DNB's most recent guidance states that the risk weight floor will apply until at least the end of 2024. For 2025, we are awaiting further guidance relating to the application of a risk weight floor for residential mortgages in combination with the Basel IV implementation.\n\nStarting in January 2025, the EU legislation that covers Basel IV is expected to come into force. Basel IV affects three key aspects of measuring capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the revision of the standardised approach, which will increase standardised risk weights for certain loan categories. The second relates to the maximum capital benefit banks can obtain from IRB credit risk models. By imposing an overall risk weight floor equal to 72.5% of risk weights based on the standardised approach, the maximum benefits from using internal credit risk models are effectively limited. The risk weight floor comes into effect on 1 January 2025 at 50%, and will be phased in over a five-year period to 72.5%. The third aspect of Basel IV, which is particularly relevant for us, is a phased-in increase in risk weighting of equity exposures, of which we have a relatively large amount (including investments in Bolster private equity funds and Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management funds). To apply a certain degree of conservatism regarding Basel IV in our capital planning (including equity capital returns), we assume Basel IV will come into effect on a fully loaded basis straight away, starting in January 2025.\n\nThe main non-credit risk-related element of Basel IV is the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book (FRTB), which we implemented from June 2021. Compared with the current Basel III legislation, FRTB is a more risk-sensitive approach. It takes our hedging strategy better into account when calculating the net-market risk position, and we therefore observe a structurally lower capital requirement.",

        "page_content": "## Our EU taxonomy alignment and eligibility\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a wealth manager with a banking licence: we are active both in asset management (via Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management) and in credit. We therefore disclose our EU taxonomy alignment and eligibility in accordance with the requirements for these activities.\n\nSince 1 January 2023, financial institutions have been required to disclose their green asset ratio (GAR) and corresponding EU taxonomy alignment related to limiting and managing the consequences of climate change (climate change mitigation and adaptation). In addition, this is the first year that financial institutions are required to report the EU taxonomy eligibility of assets related to the sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources, the transition to a circular economy, pollution prevention and control, and the protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems.\n\nIn our capacity as an asset manager, 0.8% of our assets under management (AuM) were EU taxonomy-aligned in 2023. In our capacity as a credit institution, our GAR was 10.5% in 2023, while 57.2% of our GAR assets were EU taxonomyeligible.\n\n## Assets under management\n\nOur EU taxonomy-aligned AuM comprise exposures to companies offering solutions to limit and/or address climate change across portfolios. We have not yet set a minimum percentage of EU taxonomy-aligned holdings for any of our own investment funds, discretionary portfolio management solutions, and/or MiFID II sustainability preferences profiles. This is because we still lack full insight into the EU taxonomy alignment of investee companies. We expect that the robustness and accuracy of this data will improve with the increasing uptake of the EU taxonomy by relevant institutions and the improved flow of data through service providers. We therefore expect to be able to set commitments on the minimum share of EU taxonomyaligned holdings for discretionary portfolios in 2024.\n\nAs we also lacked adequate estimates of the EU taxonomy eligibility and/or alignment of investee companies, we have not increased the coverage of our reporting by applying such estimates.\n\nThese limitations in data availability, robustness and accuracy also result in a negative value of investments that fund EU taxonomy-eligible activities but are not EU taxonomy-aligned. In other words, our data provider indicates that some companies have EU taxonomy-aligned activities but not EU taxonomy-eligible activities, which suggests a flaw in this information.\n\nIn accordance with our ambition to help our clients navigate the energy and food transitions, we aim to increase the share of EU taxonomy-aligned AuM over the coming years.\n\n## Balance sheet\n\nOur GAR mainly represents residential mortgages used to finance energy-efficient homes. Over the coming years, we aim to increase this ratio by offering more attractive interest rates to finance homes with a higher energy performance\n\ncertificate (EPC) and provide third-party expert advice to help clients increase the energy efficiency of their homes.\n\nOur EU taxonomy-aligned residential mortgages include loans with collateral objects that we estimate to be within the top 15% of the housing stock in terms of energy efficiency based on the construction year. In accordance with the standards set by the Energy Efficient Mortgages Hub Netherlands (EEM-NL), this may need to be reconsidered based on recently published guidance by the European Commission.\n\nWe have assessed various climate adaptation risks in relation to our residential mortgage portfolio (see \"Sustainability risk\" on page 70). These include the climate hazards referred to in the EU taxonomy regulation and marked as particularly relevant in the Dutch context by the the EEM-NL, with the exception of heatwaves. We aim to further analyse our exposure to risks resulting from heatwaves in the near future. Our current assessment is that these risks are less material than the other risks that have already been assessed. Based on the outcomes of our assessments, we have categorised all homes that meet the substantial contribution criteria (\"relatively energy-efficient homes\") as EU taxonomy-aligned.\n\nOther green assets include co-investments in own funds through our management book. We also invest part of our liquidity book in green bonds. We currently lack insight into the exact EU Taxonomy eligibility and alignment of these instruments. As with our AuM, we expect that the robustness and accuracy of this data will improve with the increasing uptake of the EU taxonomy.\n\nLoans and advances, other than residential mortgages, generally comprise products that are supplemental to our private banking relationship model (such as loans to healthcare professionals and business professionals) and are not offered to parties that are in scope for the EU taxonomy.\n\nIn line with our responsible lending policy, we do not finance activities relating to nuclear energy and we have strict criteria for financing fossil fuel activities. For the corporate exposures, in line with our mandatory disclosure and the Non-Financial Reporting Directive, we have evaluated exposures to the nuclear energy and fossil fuel sectors on the basis of the Nomenclature of Economic Activities codes and the activities described in the regulation. For this scope of reporting, exposures are insignificant.\n\n## Green asset ratio tables\n\nOur GAR is detailed in the tables on the following pages, which are based on the prescribed templates in Annex VI of the EU Taxonomy Disclosures Delegated Act. We made several amendments to the prescribed templates for the purposes of this report, mainly because we have no material on-balance assets in some of the stipulated categories. We have also added several breakdowns of categories within the prescribed template in order to provide our stakeholders with more transparency and clarity on our assets. The unamended templates (Annex VI) are included in our sustainability supplement on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/results.",

        "page_content": "## Van Lanschot Kempen shares\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's market capitalisation stood at \u20ac1,196 million at year-end 2023. Depositary receipts for Van Lanschot Kempen's Class A ordinary shares have been traded on the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 29 June 1999 (ISIN Code: NL0000302636; ticker: VLK.AS).\n\nThe issued share capital of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2023 consisted of 43,039,938 Class A ordinary shares ('shares'), each having a nominal value of \u20ac1. We held 562,852 treasury shares at year-end 2023. Van Lanschot Kempen is included in the Amsterdam Midkap Index, the AEX ESG Index and in the MSCI World Small Cap Index.\n\n## Shareholders and depositary receipt holders\n\nPursuant to Chapter 5.3 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, the disclosures below have been entered in the Register of Substantial Holdings as maintained by the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM). The percentages reflect the number of shares or depositary receipts on the register on the disclosure dates.\n\nDisclosure is required once a shareholder's interest reaches, exceeds or falls below a threshold value. The current interest of a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts may consequently differ from the interest reported on the disclosure date. On 31 December 2023, Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen held over 99.99% of Van Lanschot Kempen shares. For more information on Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen, see 'Depositary receipts for shares' on page 114.\n\nIn 2023, MVDP 1 became a shareholder following the successful acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. Van Lanschot Kempen paid 53% in cash and 47% in shares for the 30% stake, with a lock-up period until 2030. To this end, we issued 1,678,270 new shares and Mercier Vanderlinden's managing partners obtained a 3.9% participating interest in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's depositary receipt holders\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Employee participation plans\n\nManagement and employees, excluding MVDP, jointly owned around 4.7% of our issued share capital at year-end 2023 (year-end 2022: 4.9%). In 2023, we continued the Matching Share Plan: the investment in Van Lanschot Kempen shares that an employee makes - up to a maximum value of \u20ac3,500 - is matched by Van Lanschot Kempen one year later. A large number of employees made use of this share plan in 2023. Employees were also given the opportunity to buy shares at a discount of 18.5%, up to a value of \u20ac15,000. All shares purchased under the employee share plan are subject to a five-year lock-up period. We intend to continue this employee share plan in 2024.\n\nThe reporting year was the second for the Van Lanschot Kempen Partnership: a long-term participation plan for key senior employees. Its purpose is to anchor leadership more broadly in the organisation, further promote ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, and create more long-term alignment with our shareholders and clients. At year-end 2023, partners jointly owned 0.8% of our issued share capital.\n\nAs the partnership is a participation plan, partners are asked to make a minimum individual contribution of at least \u20ac50,000 in year one and to increase their total contribution to a minimum of \u20ac150,000 and a maximum of \u20ac500,000 over the course of five years (with a minimum contribution of \u20ac25,000 per year). Contributions can be made either in cash or through conversion of a participant's (net) fixed remuneration in shares in the respective year. Shares have a lock-up period of five years, allowing Van Lanschot Kempen to provide a discount of 18.5% on the shares bought.\n\nThe individual contributions are collected in a so-called fonds voor gemene rekening (FGR - fund for joint account). Partners' contributions remain in this fund during their full tenure as a partner. This structure has been selected to combine the shares as one voting block and to reflect the collective and collaborative nature of the partnership. In return for their contribution, partners receive FGR units, each corresponding to a share in Van Lanschot Kempen. When votes are cast on the shares held by the FGR, voting instructions are obtained from the partners. In the absence of such instructions, the FGR will either abstain or allow individual partners to vote at their own discretion. The partnership does not affect the governance and management structure of the company.",

Van Lanschot Kempen maintains its high creditworthiness by deploying its assets for the benefit of its clients and by taking on only such risks as can be understood and controlled. This ensures solid risk management processes as well as a strong capital and liquidity position. Our current credit ratings reflect our healthy capital and funding position along with our low risk profile. Van Lanschot Kempen currently has a BBB+ longterm credit rating from both S&P and Fitch.\n\n| Credit ratings                   | Standard & Poor's   | Fitch Ratings    |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------------|\n| Long-term credit rating          | BBB+                | BBB+             |\n| Long-term credit rating  outlook | Stable outlook      | Positive outlook |\n| Short-term credit rating         | A-2                 | F2               |\n| Date of latest report            | 7 November 2022     | 14 December 2023 |\n| Date of latest press  release    | 24 June 2021        | 2 June 2023      |\n\n## Research coverage\n\nThree sell-side analysts (from ABN AMRO - ODDO BHF, ING and Kepler Cheuvreux respectively) actively track Van Lanschot Kempen and regularly publish equity research reports. For more information, see our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/about-us/investor-relations/ share-information.\n\n## Dividend policy and dividend for 2023\n\nOur aim is to distribute between 50% and 70% of our underlying net result attributable to shareholders. This is the net result adjusted for minority interests, the share of holders of AT1 capital securities, and the net effect of selected special items. In 2023, the underlying net result available for distribution to shareholders amounted to \u20ac123.8 million, working out at underlying earnings per share of \u20ac2.95. 2\n\nOur strong results and solid capital position enable us to propose a dividend distribution of \u20ac2.00 per share to our shareholders (2022: \u20ac1.75 per share). The shareholders at the annual general meeting (AGM) to be held on 23 May 2024 will be invited to adopt the dividend proposal. Based on the number of shares in issue on 31 December 2023 (excluding treasury shares), the proposed dividend payments will total \u20ac85.0 million. This corresponds to a payout ratio of 68.6% of the underlying net result attributable to shareholders, and amounts to 71.7% of net result attributable to shareholders. The proportion of net result attributable to shareholders that won't be paid out (i.e. \u20ac33.5 million) will be added to reserves.\n\n## Capital management policy\n\nBy year-end 2023, our CET 1 ratio of 19.6% was above our target of 15% plus an add-on of 2.5% for acquisitions.\n\nWe intend to distribute additional capital above a CET 1 ratio of 17.5% to our shareholders going forward, subject to regulatory approval.\n\nSince 2016, we have paid out a total of over \u20ac720 million excluding the 2023 dividend - to our shareholders in the form of both dividends and capital returns.\n\n| Key figures per ordinary share                      | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2020   | 2019   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Share price (\u20ac):                                    |        |        |        |        |        |\n| High                                                | 31.65  | 26.90  | 26.95  | 21.90  | 23.30  |\n| Low                                                 | 22.25  | 19.14  | 20.35  | 9.23   | 17.28  |\n| Closing                                             | 28.15  | 21.90  | 22.00  | 21.00  | 20.05  |\n| Average daily trading volume in depositary receipts | 93,977 | 53,959 | 51,184 | 87,525 | 32,920 |\n| Market capitalisation (\u20ac million) (year-end) 3      | 1,196  | 892    | 899    | 863    | 820    |\n| Net asset value per share (\u20ac)                       | 29.36  | 31.45  | 32.01  | 30.54  | 29.59  |\n| Price-earnings ratio 4                              | 9.5    | 8.1    | 5.9    | 19.4   | 8.0    |\n\n| Information on dividend per ordinary share      |   2023 |   2022 |   2021 |   2020 |   2019 |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Underlying earnings per ordinary share (\u20ac) 3    |   2.95 |   2.72 |   3.74 |   1.08 |   2.52 |\n| Dividend per ordinary share (\u20ac)                 |   2    |   1.75 |   2    |   0.7  |   1.45 |\n| Dividend yield (%)                              |   7.1  |   8    |   9.1  |   3.3  |   7.2  |\n| Pay-out ratio (%)                               |  68.6  |  66.9  |  53.4  |  65.1  |  57.4  |\n| Total return for holders of ordinary shares (%) |  46    |  15    |  15    |   5    |  16    |",

        "page_content": "## Report of the Supervisory Board\n\nThis report gives an overview of the activities of the Supervisory Board and its committees in 2023. For a description of the composition and operation of the Supervisory Board, see \"Corporate governance\" starting on page 112 .\n\nThe Supervisory Board supervises and advises the Management Board on performing its management tasks and setting the direction for Van Lanschot Kempen. In its activities, the Supervisory Board focuses on long-term, sustainable value creation for our clients, for our shareholders and for society. The members of the Supervisory Board are fully independent.\n\nThis report includes information about the achievement of corporate targets, the relationship with stakeholders and the relevant aspects of sustainability. It also covers the internal organisation, the meetings of the Supervisory Board and its committees, and the annual evaluation of the performance of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members.\n\n## Supervision\n\n## Achievement of corporate targets\n\nThe 2023 reporting year was marked by turbulence. Rapidly changing economic and geopolitical circumstances, coupled with extreme climate events, required close monitoring, while Van Lanschot Kempen remained focused on being a steward for its clients. Financial markets were volatile, due to higher inflation than had been anticipated by policymakers. In response, the European Central Bank (ECB) rapidly raised the deposit facility rates, resulting in higher interest rates. This had an impact on all our clients, employees and the company itself.\n\nDespite this turmoil, Van Lanschot Kempen continued to deliver on its wealth management strategy, by focusing on sustainable and profitable growth while maintaining a capital-light balance sheet. The company added 18% to its assets under management (AuM) in 2023, reflecting organic growth, growth by acquisition and market performance. The reporting year again saw high net inflows in both the Private Clients segment and the Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment, demonstrating the trust that existing and new private and institutional clients place in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe company also continued to grow inorganically in 2023, completing the accelerated acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden and the acquisition of Robeco's online investment platform. In December 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen announced the intended acquisition of Belgian investment adviser Accuro: a further step in its growth strategy in Belgium as its second home market.\n\nIn 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen posted good results on its medium-term financial targets. The cost/income ratio was 71.6% in 2023, against a target of 70% - showing that this still requires attention. The company's capital position continued to be strong in 2023, which allowed for a capital return to shareholders of \u20ac2.00 per share (around \u20ac85 million in total) in December 2023.\n\nSustainability remains a priority for Van Lanschot Kempen and for the Supervisory Board. The company is focused on helping its clients navigate the energy and food transitions, with an active, engaged approach based on its investment principles. Starting in 2024, more ambitious targets were set to decrease Van Lanschot Kempen's own carbon footprint and to reduce carbon emissions via its discretionary AuM.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen aims for a diverse and inclusive culture. During the reporting year, dialogue around various aspects of identity and culture, including the company's values, code of conduct and collaboration, took place. Meanwhile, continuous awareness of gender diversity targets and metrics remained a priority. This showed that achieving the gender diversity targets among senior staff will take a persistent effort over a longer period of time.\n\n## Structure and functioning of risk management\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's principal risks, as well as the structure and functioning of its risk management and control systems, are discussed by the Risk and Compliance Committee. As of 1 January 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen implemented a split in the risk management function, separating financial and non-financial risk management into two distinct departments, each reporting to the Chief Risk Officer (CRO). Over the course of 2023, the Chair of the Risk and Compliance Committee reported its main conclusions and recommendations to the Supervisory Board. Van Lanschot Kempen's risk appetite statement is subject to the Supervisory Board's annual approval. The risk appetite statement for 2024 was approved at the Supervisory Board's December meeting.\n\n## Financial reporting\n\nFinancial reporting is discussed regularly at the Audit Committee's meetings, which are also attended by the external auditors. After each meeting, the Chair of the committee reports on committee discussions to the full Supervisory Board. All members of the Supervisory Board, except for one, attended the Audit Committee's meeting in 2023 at which the 2022 annual figures were discussed. The Supervisory Board approved the financial statements for 2022 on 22 February 2023.\n\nFollowing a proposal by the Supervisory Board, PricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as external auditors for the 2024 financial year at the annual general meeting (AGM) held on 25 May 2023. To comply with mandatory audit firm rotation obligations, Van Lanschot Kempen started a process to select and appoint a new external auditor. After a thorough process, the Supervisory Board decided to propose the appointment of KPMG Accountants NV (KPMG) as the company's external auditors, effective from the start of the 2025 financial year. The shareholders appointed KPMG as external auditors for the 2025 financial year at the AGM on 25 May 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Legal and regulatory compliance\n\nThe Supervisory Board is regularly provided with information on developments regarding the compliance framework; projects to strengthen compliance policies and processes, including anti-money laundering and antiterrorist financing, sanctions and client due diligence processes; and interactions with supervisory authorities regarding compliance with regulations.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed periodically about the ongoing implementation of new legislation and regulations, such as the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), preparation for the new environmental, social and governance (ESG) reporting requirements under the EU taxonomy, the Gender Balance Act and the amended Dutch Corporate Governance Code. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about the implementation of the findings resulting from the on-site inspection by De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) on interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) as well as the closure of DNB's 2021 inspection of the internal governance and risk management of the compliance function.\n\n## Relationship with stakeholders\n\nThe Supervisory Board regularly discussed Van Lanschot Kempen's relationship with its stakeholders. Topics discussed with stakeholders included the general development of Van Lanschot Kempen, progress against the company's wealth management strategy, the strategy and targets for 2023, organic and inorganic growth opportunities, the company's strong capital base, and its sustainability profile and approach.\n\nIn October and November 2023, a delegation from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board held several engagement meetings with a broad group of Van Lanschot Kempen's stakeholders to discuss their views on the proposal for the revision of the remuneration policies for the Management and Supervisory Boards. For further information on these engagement meetings, see \"Remuneration report\" on page 102.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board also participated in regular meetings with DNB and the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM).\n\nThe Supervisory Board values its constructive relationship with the Works Council. Bernadette Langius and Karin Bergstein attended a meeting with the Works Council in April 2023. A delegation from the Supervisory Board also attended the meetings of the Works Council with the Management Board, at which the general course of business at Van Lanschot Kempen was discussed.\n\nThe Works Council used its enhanced right of recommendation for the vacancy on the Supervisory Board that arose due to the expiry of Bernadette Langius's second four-year term of appointment. The Supervisory Board adopted the recommendation of the Works Council and nominated Elizabeth Nolan for appointment to the Supervisory Board at the AGM on 25 May 2023. Following this nomination, she was appointed to the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Relevant aspects of sustainability\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed the company's sustainability roadmap, progress on implementing various regulations and standards, updated sustainability governance structure, materiality assessment and nonfinancial KPIs for 2024-25. In addition, the Risk and Compliance Committee was informed about progress made on applying the company's responsible lending policy and on implementing the SFDR and new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) regulatory requirements relating to sustainability.\n\nThe Supervisory Board noted the effort Van Lanschot Kempen is making to implement various sustainability regulations and standards. In the second half of 2023, the focus was on the shift from sustainability as a separate project to its integration into the various business activities. The Supervisory Board is pleased to see that Van Lanschot Kempen is putting significant work into integrating all relevant aspects of sustainability further into its client solutions and risk management processes. Sustainability requires ongoing attention from Van Lanschot Kempen going forward.\n\n## Internal organisation\n\n## Composition of the Management Board\n\nThe composition of the Management Board did not change in 2023. The Management Board currently consists of Maarten Edixhoven (Chair), Jeroen Kroes, Wendy Winkelhuijzen, Arjan Huisman, Richard Bruens and Erik van Houwelingen. In September 2023, Richard Bruens informed the Management and Supervisory Boards that he would like to pursue new challenges, and had therefore decided to step down as a member of the Management Board on 1 June 2024. The Supervisory Board greatly appreciates Richard's major contribution to the development and success of private banking and investment banking, and is grateful for his dedication to Van Lanschot Kempen over the past ten years.\n\nThe Supervisory Board intends to appoint Wendy Winkelhuijzen, currently Chief Risk Officer and member of the Management Board, as his successor. Wendy has held several positions within corporate finance, private banking, investor relations, corporate development and strategy. The intention is for her to take on the responsibility for the Private Clients Netherlands and Investment Banking Clients segments.\n\nThe recruitment process for a new Chief Risk Officer and member of the Management Board has started. An external executive search firm supported the Selection and Nomination Committee and the Supervisory Board in their selection process. The Supervisory Board expects that it will be able to give notice of the intention to appoint a new member of the Management Board at the AGM in 2024.\n\n## Composition of the Supervisory Board\n\nTo ensure an appropriate and balanced composition of the Supervisory Board, the Board regularly discusses its profile and composition. The composition of the Supervisory Board changed in 2023.",

        "page_content": "To our great sadness, Lex van Overmeire passed away in April 2023. He was a highly valued member of the Supervisory Board for more than six years. His experience as an external auditor of financial institutions was very valuable and he was much respected as Chair of the Audit Committee. He carried out his tasks as a member of the Supervisory Board with a great sense of duty and continued to do so until the very end. We are very grateful to Lex for his important contributions to Van Lanschot Kempen over the years, during which the Supervisory Board greatly benefited from his knowledge and experience. Karin Bergstein worked closely with Lex van Overmeire from mid-2022. She was appointed Chair of the Audit Committee in December 2023, having acted as interim Chair since February.\n\nThe recruitment process for a new member of the Supervisory Board started in 2023. The Supervisory Board expects to propose a new member in the course of 2024.\n\nBernadette Langius stepped down as a member of the Supervisory Board after the AGM on 25 May 2023 when her second term expired, making her no longer available for reappointment. We are very grateful for her commitment and meaningful contribution to the Supervisory Board over the past eight years - in particular, for all her work as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. She was succeeded by Elizabeth Nolan, who was appointed as a new member of the Supervisory Board at the AGM on 25 May 2023.\n\nAccording to schedule, Frans Blom's first term of appointment expired in May 2023. He was reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board at the AGM on 25 May 2023 until the AGM in 2027.\n\nFor further information and background on the members of the Supervisory Board, see page 122.\n\n## Supervisory Board meetings\n\nThe Supervisory Board held ten meetings in 2023. The Management Board attends the formal meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed supporting information. Regular items on the agenda of these meetings include the company's strategy, developments within the various business activities, corporate governance, risk management, compliance, audit, IT, operations, financial results, the annual budget, capital strategy and HR topics.\n\nIn addition, the Supervisory Board discussed:\n\n- -Business plans of the various client segments;\n- -M&A opportunities;\n- -Acquisition and integration of Robeco's online investment platform;\n- -Acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management, and the legal merger and integration of Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management with Van Lanschot Belgium;\n- -IT roadmap of investment management activities;\n- -Organisational changes;\n- -Progress on several compliance projects;\n- -2023 Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA);\n- -Sustainability strategy and update on the action plan;\n- -Annual report, sustainability reports and tax transparency report;\n- -Proposal to appoint KPMG as the new external auditor from the 2025 financial year;\n\n- -Succession planning;\n- -Composition of the Management Board and recruitment of a new CRO;\n- -Attraction and development of talent at Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- -Research into the indirect involvement of Van Lanschot Kempen's predecessors with slavery;\n- -Branding, identity and values of Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- -Proposal for a capital return to shareholders;\n- -Share buyback programme;\n- -Issue of a covered bond;\n- -Revision of the Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies.\n\nThe Supervisory Board held eight additional meetings with Supervisory Board members only. These meetings gave the Supervisory Board the opportunity to reflect on agenda items, identify possible items requiring attention from the Supervisory Board, and discuss the composition of the Management and Supervisory Boards and the evaluation of how both Boards are working. The Chair of the Management Board was invited to attend these meetings. At the meeting in February 2023, the Supervisory Board discussed the performance of the members of the Management Board in 2022.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received the information needed to perform its tasks from the Management Board. Information was also provided by the external auditors. Employees from within the organisation regularly attended meetings to provide additional information on specific topics within their respective fields. This also gave the Supervisory Board the opportunity to get acquainted with senior employees, which is helpful for the Supervisory Board's talent management and succession planning activities.\n\nThe agendas for Supervisory Board meetings were drawn up by the Company Secretary, in consultation with the Chair of the Supervisory Board. Between meetings, the Chair of the Supervisory Board regularly maintained contact with the Chair of the Management Board. Supervisory Board members also held meetings with members of the Management Board and employees, relating to their membership of specific Supervisory Board committees and particular topics.\n\nSupervisory Board members were rarely absent from the Supervisory Board meetings or meetings of its committees. The table on the following page shows the composition of Supervisory Board committees, and the attendance rate of each member of the Supervisory Board at the Board and committee meetings.\n\n## Supervisory Board committees\n\n## Composition of Supervisory Board committees\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members: the Audit Committee, Risk and Compliance Committee, Selection and Nomination Committee, and Remuneration Committee. Each committee advises the Supervisory Board and prepares decisionmaking by the Board in its designated area of interest. These committees meet separately throughout the year. The main considerations and conclusions of the committees are shared with the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board remains fully responsible for all decisions.",

The Chair of the Management Board, Chief Financial Officer (CFO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO) attended these meetings, while some meetings were attended by the other members of the Supervisory and Management Boards.\n\n## Key items for discussion\n\n## Audit Committee review and conclusion\n\nImpairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors Impairments for individually identifiable loans are based on IFRS 9. Van Lanschot Kempen recognises a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on all loans. The ECL is calculated by using purpose-built IFRS 9 models. For credit-impaired loans, the Credit Approval and Financial Restructuring & Recovery team provides input in determining the level of credit loss allowances.\n\nDetermining the appropriateness of the individual items involves elements of judgement and requires management to make assumptions. In these judgements and assumptions, the uncertainties relating to market volatility, rapidly rising interest rates, increased cost of living and current geopolitical developments need to be taken into account.\n\nOn the basis of periodic management reports and the outcome of the audit procedures performed by the auditors, we challenged the completeness and accuracy of the impairments made. We discussed the changes in loss allowances during the year as well as the loss allowances recognised in the income statement.\n\nWe discussed developments on the rising cost of living and the effects on the portfolio, and how these impacted both the IFRS 9 models and the management overlay.\n\nWe discussed the potential impact of climate change on our loan portfolio and agreed with management that no credit loss allowances in Stages 1 and 2, and no impairments in Stage 3, are currently needed.\n\nBased on our discussions and considering the acceptable range in the context of estimate uncertainty, we agree with the methodology applied by management in determining the provisions for impairments of loans and advances to the public and private sectors, and with the corresponding results. The disclosures relating to this item are set out in Note 6 to the financial statements.\n\nThe external auditors, and the heads of Internal Audit and Finance, Reporting & Control were also present at the meetings to discuss financial performance and audit matters. The Audit Committee also met with the internal and external auditors without the members of the Management Board being present, to discuss the course of affairs during the financial year.\n\nThe Audit Committee carried out a detailed assessment of the annual figures, half-year figures and information used for the trading updates. Particular attention was paid to significant financial items in relation to the company's (interim) financial statements and disclosures, which are shown in the table below.",

The committee discussed the long-term maturity roadmap for the Non-Financial Risk Management department and its 2024 annual plan in December.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee followed financial risks at its meetings throughout the year. The committee discussed credit risk and the influence of the slowdown of the Dutch economy on the risks in the portfolio and the various results of credit risk stress tests. Market risk and settlement risk were also discussed. Special attention was paid to interest rate risks, given the sharp increase in interest rates in 2023, the volatility of spreads and the impact of the duration on Van Lanschot Kempen's profit. The 2024 annual plan for the Financial Risk Management department was discussed in December.\n\nThe committee also discussed sustainability risks, which became a standard topic on the agenda of the committee's meetings as of 2023. These included the impact that physical and transitional risks could have on the various risk types as well as the short-, medium- and long-term impact of climate change and the landscape of sustainability regulation in which the company operates.",

At its February meeting, the committee discussed the Management Board's 2023 key performance indicators (KPIs) and the 2022 remuneration report.\n\nThe committee also discussed the employment conditions and overall reward principles of Van Lanschot Kempen, and new remuneration policies for the Management and Supervisory Boards. The members of the Remuneration Committee participated in a working group to prepare the proposals for the revised remuneration policies for the Management and Supervisory Boards. These proposals were subsequently discussed with stakeholders. Based on the outcome of this dialogue, a proposal for the revised remuneration policies will be put to vote at the AGM in May 2024. For further information on the remuneration of the Management Board, see \"Remuneration of the Management Board in 2023\" on page 105.\n\nAt the committee's January meeting, the 2022 variable remuneration paid to Van Lanschot Kempen staff was discussed. The total amount available for variable remuneration of Van Lanschot Kempen staff for 2023 was among the topics discussed at the December meeting.\n\n## Assuring governance quality\n\n## Evaluation of the Supervisory Board\n\nThe Supervisory Board values the structural evaluation process to ensure continuous improvement in its way of working. Each year, the Supervisory Board evaluates the composition and functioning of the Supervisory Board, its committees and individual members. The evaluation is carried out under the guidance of an external adviser once every three years. In the other years, the evaluation is carried out via self-assessment, using a questionnaire that is completed by each Supervisory Board member.\n\nIn 2023, the Supervisory Board entrusted the annual evaluation to an external adviser. The evaluation process took place in December 2023 and January 2024, and included interviews with all Supervisory Board members. Each Board member also completed a questionnaire. The evaluation includes the participation and contribution of each member of the Supervisory Board, the knowledge and experience of the Supervisory Board collectively, the conduct and culture of its members, the interaction and dynamics within the Supervisory Board, the communication and provision of information, the decision-making process and quality of the information provided for Supervisory Board meetings, the independence of mind of the individual members, whether members are able to commit sufficient time to fulfil their role within the Supervisory Board, and the relationship with the Management Board. The outcomes of the evaluation were discussed by the Supervisory Board at a meeting in January 2024, and recommendations will be implemented as a result.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the Board and its committees are functioning well, and that its composition is in line with the required profile in terms of suitability, expertise and diversity, and also complies with Principle 2.1 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The Supervisory Board discussed the skills and experience that would be desirable when vacancies arise on the Board. The Supervisory Board also agreed that the topic of clientcentricity will be discussed at least once a year as a specific agenda item. The Supervisory Board will arrange a separate meeting with the Management Board to discuss strategic topics. Further attention will be paid to debriefing the Supervisory Board well on items that have been discussed in the meetings of the Supervisory Board committees.\n\nThe relationship with the Management Board is open and constructive, while remaining sufficiently critical. Conclusions and recommendations relevant to the Management Board are shared with the Management Board.\n\n## Evaluation of the Management Board\n\nIn February 2024, the Supervisory Board evaluated the functioning of the Management Board as a whole and that of its individual members based on the KPIs for 2023. The Supervisory Board sets the KPIs for the Management Board every year. These KPIs consist of Van Lanschot Kempen's external financial and non-financial KPIs, with additional KPIs on financial and non-financial topics. The achievement of the KPIs by the Management Board is monitored during the year. Financial KPIs for 2023 included the return on CET 1, the CET 1 ratio and the cost/income ratio. Nonfinancial KPIs include sustainability ambitions, reduction in carbon emissions, employee engagement, inclusion and diversity, and the Net Promoter Score for Private Clients, Wholesale & Institutional Clients and Evi van Lanschot. The assessment of the KPIs forms the basis for the collective assessment of the Management Board and the individual assessment of its members for 2023. For further information on company performance against these KPIs, see \"Steering and monitoring our business in 2023\" on page 14.\n\nAt the beginning of 2024, a delegation from the Supervisory Board (with input from its members) held meetings with each of the members of the Management Board to review their individual performance as well as the performance of the entire Management Board and the company over the past year. During these meetings, self-assessments by the individual Board members were further elucidated and discussed. Topics typically included personal performance and goals, cooperation within the Management Board, execution of the company strategy and any lessons learned. Overall, the performance was evaluated to be good, and it was noted that the two most recent appointees to the Management Board had settled in their roles very well. These conclusions were shared with the members of the Management Board. The 2024 KPIs for the Management Board are in line with Van Lanschot Kempen's financial and non-financial KPIs for 2024 (see page 28).\n\nThe Management Board evaluated its own operation and effectiveness on a regular basis during its off-site meetings. Board members gave each other feedback on their strengths and points to consider, and reflected on these. In addition, the Management Board will carry out a self-evaluation with the support of an external adviser in 2024.",

        "page_content": "## On-boarding programme\n\nAll new members of the Management and Supervisory Boards complete a comprehensive on-boarding programme when appointed. The programme is tailor-made for each newly appointed Board member, as their knowledge and experience varies. The aim of the on-boarding programme is to ensure that new Board members have thorough knowledge of Van Lanschot Kempen, its strategy, business activities and key risks to fulfil their role within the Management and Supervisory Boards. Depending on the individual role and needs of the Board members, in-depth meetings with senior managers of relevant departments are incorporated into the on-boarding programme.\n\n## Education\n\nAs ongoing education is an important part of good governance, the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards take part in a continuous education programme. In 2023, three educational sessions were organised. Topics covered included:\n\n- -Pensions developments: UK fiduciary management business, UK pension market, new pension agreement in the Netherlands;\n- -Artificial intelligence (AI): generative AI in wealth management and its impact on Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- -Model risk.\n\nThese educational sessions were positively rated by the members of the Supervisory and Management Boards.\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Supervisory Board attaches great importance to the independence of its members. All members of the Supervisory Board perform their duties independently and critically. The independence requirements described in best practice provisions 2.1.7 to 2.1.9 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code have been fulfilled. Currently, there are no dependent members on the Supervisory Board. In the event of a potential conflict of interest relating to a particular topic, the Supervisory Board member concerned is not allowed to participate in discussions or decision-making on that topic. Best practice provisions 2.7.3 to 2.7.4 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code were observed as far as applicable. In 2023, there were no conflicts of interest of material significance for members of the Supervisory or Management Boards.\n\n## Financial statements\n\nThe Supervisory Board has reviewed and approved the 2023 annual report and the 2023 financial statements. The 2023 financial statements have been audited by the external auditors, PwC. The independent auditors' report can be found on page 243. The external auditors have also issued a limited assurance report on the sustainability information in this annual report, which can be found on page 263 . We invite the AGM to adopt the 2023 financial statements as submitted, and to discharge the Management Board in respect of its conduct of Van Lanschot Kempen's affairs and the members of the Supervisory Board in respect of their supervision.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThe Supervisory Board would like to thank all stakeholders for their trust in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nWe value our relationship with the Management Board and would like to thank the members of the Management Board and all employees for their hard work and commitment to Van Lanschot Kempen's clients, as well as their contribution to the company's strong results over the past year.\n\nWe would also like to reiterate our sadness at the passing of our colleague Lex van Overmeire. He was a truly dedicated, supportive, thoughtful and critical member of the Supervisory Board, who was always willing to share his insightful views for the benefit of the entire team. He will be dearly missed.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 21 February 2024\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nFrans Blom, Chair\n\nManfred Schepers, Vice-Chair\n\nKarin Bergstein Brigitte Boone Maarten Muller Elizabeth Nolan",

This report is guided by requirements originating from the EU Shareholder Rights Directive (SRD II).\n\nThis report includes both a summary of our Management Board and Supervisory Board remuneration policies and our annual report on remuneration, which sets out how our policy was applied during 2023 and how it will be applied in 2024. On 28 May 2020, the annual general meeting (AGM) approved the remuneration policies for the Management Board with a majority of 93.7% of the votes cast, and for the Supervisory Board with 100% of the votes cast. The remuneration policies were reviewed in 2023 and will once again be on the AGM agenda in 2024.\n\nThe 2022 remuneration report was approved by the AGM (advisory vote) with a majority of 98.88% of the votes cast. There was no specific follow-up given the outcome of this vote. We did not receive any substantive comments on the 2022 remuneration report. The 2023 remuneration report will be subject to an advisory vote at our AGM on 23 May 2024.\n\n## Alignment with our strategic framework\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is a specialist, independent wealth manager with a banking licence. This leads to specific challenges from a remuneration perspective, especially within the Dutch regulatory context.\n\nComposition Chair Maarten Muller\n\nMembers Karin Bergstein Frans Blom\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nWe are the second largest wealth manager in the Netherlands and we compete with large financial institutions in our sectors. We strongly believe that our future success requires a robust Management Board with a proven track record in wealth management and related investment banking activities, with knowledge of the risk and compliance challenges associated with this. Experience in digitalisation and advanced analytics is also key. As a consequence, the remuneration of the Management Board members should be such that Van Lanschot Kempen is able to attract and retain the necessary talent, which includes future board members from highly specialist wealth management and technology firms. Moreover, the Management Board's remuneration package must be structured to fit properly within the Dutch context.\n\n## Remuneration principles remained unchanged in 2023\n\nWe believe in rewarding long-term sustainable performance to help achieve our long-term strategy. This is reflected in our Management Board remuneration policy. Since 2015, this consists of fixed remuneration only (no variable remuneration) and includes a large proportion in depositary receipts for shares (hereinafter: shares), with a five-year lock-up period, in combination with share ownership guidelines. 2 This creates a strong focus on sustainable long-term value creation.\n\nThe remuneration structure for the Management and Supervisory Boards remained unchanged in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Total remuneration in 2023\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external perspectives. When adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company and remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce (governed by collective employment conditions). Moreover, the Remuneration Committee takes note of individual Management Board members' views on the amount and structure of their own remuneration.\n\nIn line with the Management Board remuneration policy approved by shareholders, the Supervisory Board indexed the fixed remuneration of the members of the Management Board. The indexation was applied on 1 January 2023 at 3.5% and on 1 July 2023 at 0.5%. Compared with the wider workforce (who received a total increase of 5.4%), the Supervisory Board believed it was appropriate to apply a lower indexation percentage to the Management Board.\n\nFor more information about the Management Board's remuneration package and pay ratios, see 'Remuneration of the Management Board in 2023' on page 105.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board assesses and challenges the performance of the Management Board based on a set of financial and non-financial key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs are strongly aligned with the KPIs for the rest of the organisation, and reflect both the interests of its stakeholders and its ambitions as a wealth manager. In assessing the performance of the Management Board, great value is attached to their performance as a team. This is the starting point of the performance assessment, given the company's integrated wealth management model. If the performance of a Management Board member is below par, the Supervisory Board will discuss this with the relevant Board member, and may also decide not to apply any indexation. If the performance is consistently below par, the Supervisory Board may dismiss the responsible Board member (after consulting the general meeting).\n\n## Looking ahead to 2024\n\nThe current remuneration structure for the Management Board and Supervisory Board will largely stay in place. Further to the review that took place in 2023, a limited number of changes to the existing remuneration policies will be proposed at the 2024 AGM:\n\n## Management Board remuneration policy\n\n- -The reference group used to benchmark remuneration was reconsidered based on past stakeholder feedback and changes will be proposed at the 2024 AGM. No adjustments are proposed in the corresponding remuneration levels.\n- -To align the remuneration of the Management Board with shareholder interests, it is proposed to link the remuneration in shares to a fixed percentage of total remuneration, as well as expanding the share ownership guidelines.\n- -In line with emerging practice, a specific derogation clause is proposed that gives the Supervisory Board the opportunity to temporarily deviate from the policy in predefined exceptional circumstances, when necessary to ensure the viability of the company or to serve its longterm interests and sustainability.\n\n## Supervisory Board remuneration policy\n\n- -The fee levels for the Supervisory Board are proposed to be updated in order to remain competitive, in light of increased responsibilities and time commitment, and to attract and retain the right talent, both domestic and international.\n- -An indexation clause is proposed to ensure that the Supervisory Board remuneration policy is future-proof.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nWe take stakeholders' views very seriously and welcome an open dialogue on all aspects of remuneration. In preparation for the 2024 AGM, a delegation from the Remuneration Committee of the Supervisory Board consulted with a large cross-section of the company's shareholder base, proxy advisers, the Works Council and various client groups. At these meetings, explanations were given about SRD II; the Management and Supervisory Board remuneration policies; the Supervisory Board's view on rewarding long-term sustainable performance; and the Dutch context, such as the Dutch law on remuneration of financial undertakings, the Dutch Corporate Governance Code and the Dutch Banking Code. The dialogue with our stakeholders was very constructive. Gaining their views on executive pay in general, and Van Lanschot Kempen's remuneration policy in particular, was very valuable.\n\nThe Supervisory Board received detailed feedback from each of the meetings, and appreciates that it is important for stakeholders to have a clear understanding of the decisions made around remuneration. We would like to thank all the stakeholders for their valuable input. The feedback was very constructive, and the Supervisory Board will take it into account going forward. Van Lanschot Kempen will continue this broader scope of stakeholder engagement, and will aim to liaise with stakeholders on sensitive matters well before these items are put on the agenda of the AGM. The remuneration policy for the Management and Supervisory Boards will be put to the vote at the AGM in 2024.\n\n## Indexation of Management Board remuneration\n\nThe 2024 indexation of the fixed remuneration of the Management Board was discussed by the Supervisory Board, in line with the remuneration policy. For the wider workforce - governed by collective employment conditions - an indexation amounting to 3.15% was applied on 1 January 2024. The Supervisory Board believes it is appropriate to apply a lower indexation percentage to the Management Board than to the wider workforce.\n\nThe Supervisory Board concluded that the performance of all Management Board members was (at least) on target, and that indexation can be justified by the company's financial performance. The decision was therefore made to index the fixed remuneration of the Management Board on 1 January 2024. Although 2023 performance was strong, an indexation percentage of 1% was chosen to reflect the Management Board's focus on cost control.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands, 21 February 2024\n\n## Remuneration Committee\n\nMaarten Muller , Chair\n\n<!-- image -->",

We build close relationships with our clients so that we can guide them in their financial decisions. Only by putting ourselves in their shoes can we use our collective expertise to present them with fitting solutions and products in support of their long-term goals.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is the oldest independent financial institution in the Netherlands, with a heritage dating back almost 300 years. We couple long-standing relationships with a talent for staying one step ahead. That's what makes Van Lanschot Kempen unique: across generations, we've acted decisively and proactively to help our clients move onwards with a personal and entrepreneurial approach, grounded in clear investment principles. We manage, invest and advise on behalf of the individuals, families and businesses we serve. This is what we aim to capture in our core promise - Onwards together ( Kom verder ) - which applies both to our clients and to each other.\n\nWe are an independent, well-capitalised wealth manager with a banking licence. We have a strong specialist position in our chosen markets, combining private banking, investment management and investment banking. We believe our knowledge, experience and personal approach, coupled with our unique combination of activities, are what set us apart.\n\nThis view is reflected in our approach to remuneration. The remuneration of the Management Board consists of fixed remuneration only, and includes a large proportion in Van Lanschot Kempen shares (with a five-year lock-up period), creating a strong focus on the long-term continuity of the company and subsequent strong client relations.\n\n## We believe in:\n\n## Focusing on the long term\n\nVariable remuneration is scrutinised in Dutch society, especially in the financial sector. The use of variable remuneration can lead to a focus on short-term performance. As we believe in rewarding longterm sustainable performance, we pay only fixed remuneration to our Management Board.\n\n## Rewarding sustainable performance\n\nWe pay out a substantial proportion of fixed remuneration in shares to ensure our Board members focus on long-term, sustainable performance. To maximise this effect, these shares are subject to a five-year lock-up period (during which the shares cannot be sold).\n\n## Creating a sense of ownership\n\nWe believe in aligning our interests with those of our shareholders through a high level of personal share ownership. Our share ownership guidelines stipulate that Management Board members must hold Van Lanschot Kempen shares with a value equal to or above the cash portion of two years of their gross salary (for as long as they remain in office). If the share price is not performing, the Board members must keep increasing their holdings.\n\n## Performance management\n\nThe Supervisory Board evaluates both the performance of the Management Board as a whole and that of the individual Management Board members on an annual basis. Performance discussions are held with the individual members. The Management Board also annually evaluates its own functioning as a whole and that of its individual members. If an individual Management Board member underperforms, they are held accountable.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has developed a set of KPIs focusing on longterm value creation. These are in line with the company's values and will be reassessed from time to time. The KPIs that are relevant from a strategy and stakeholder perspective are disclosed in the sections about our value creation per type of capital on pages 32-52. These KPIs are applicable to the members of the Management Board.",

For the wider workforce an indexation was applied, amounting to 4.4% on 1 January 2023 and 1% on 1 July 2023. These relatively high percentages were a result of the high-inflation environment. The Supervisory Board believed it was appropriate to apply a lower indexation percentage to the Management Board. The decision was therefore made to index the fixed remuneration of the Management Board at 3.5% on 1 January 2023 and 0.5% on 1 July 2023. This was granted fully in cash, in accordance with the Management Board remuneration policy. The remuneration paid to the Management Board in 2023 and 2022 is presented in the table on the following page.",

The current remuneration policy does not contain room for derogation.\n\n## Total remuneration of the Management Board\n\nWe review total remuneration for the Management Board periodically, taking into account internal and external considerations.\n\n## Internal pay ratios, fairness and wider workforce considerations\n\nWhen adopting the Management Board remuneration package, we consider pay ratios within the company attaching importance to the need for a sound pay ratio. The development of the pay ratio is discussed annually with the Works Council.\n\nA comparison of the CEO's remuneration package and the average remuneration 10 of an employee within Van Lanschot Kempen results in a pay ratio of 11:1, the same as in 2022 and in line with the industry benchmark.\n\nAs part of the review of Management Board remuneration, we take into account the alignment with remuneration policies in place across the wider workforce. This includes considering the structure of remuneration packages at each level of the business to ensure there is a strong rationale for how these evolve across the different levels of the organisation.\n\nFor more detailed information on Management Board remuneration versus remuneration for the wider workforce (as well as company performance), see 'Supplementary disclosure related to Management Board remuneration' on page 108.\n\n## External considerations\n\nTo assess the remuneration levels of the Management Board versus external market levels, we use a well-balanced, focused group of companies, which reflects our talent market for Management Board positions. This serves as one of many checks in the determination of remuneration levels.\n\nWe are convinced that market capitalisation is not the deciding factor for attracting talent. Our talent market is much broader than that of our direct competitors. This is evidenced by four of our current Management Board members, who were hired from top-notch larger firms. The relevant market includes both financial services companies and non-financial industry companies, both Dutch and international, and companies that are similar to and larger in size than Van Lanschot Kempen. The relative size of the company versus our competitors drives the need to attract better people than the competition. Prompted by our business strategy, we are willing to pay for the best people in the market. Typically, this talent comes from companies that are larger than ours.\n\nOur external reference market consists of the following types of companies:\n\n- -Specialist wealth management companies : We are a (highly) specialist company and need to be able to attract specialists to further grow the business.

        "page_content": "other standalone specialist wealth management companies of comparable size in the Netherlands, we look at companies active in western Europe. We take into account standalone companies, broadly comparable in terms of number of employees and type of professional setting.\n\n- -Dutch banks : Although not all of the country's banks are directly comparable in terms of activities and size, these companies are subject to the same regulatory framework and are part of the same public debate.\n- -Other Dutch companies : Although other banks and specialist wealth management companies are important from a talent market perspective, our talent pool does not only consist of financial services companies. For example, in pursuing our wealth management strategy, professional qualifications are key - including the ability to adapt to technological changes. Because of this, our peer group also consists of other, non-financial Dutch companies - for example, in the technology sector. These companies are larger than ours, reflecting our experience that talent suitable for our Management Board is likely to be attracted from (and lost to) larger companies.\n\nThe peer group is in line with requirements as laid down in the Dutch Banking Code. This code prescribes that the peer group should be composed of comparable positions both inside and outside the financial industry, including the relevant international context. The composition of the current peer group is set out in the following table.\n\n| Management Board peer group in 2023      | Management Board peer group in 2023   | Management Board peer group in 2023   |\n|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Specialist wealth  management  companies | Dutch banks                           | Other Dutch  companies                |\n| BIL                                      | ABN AMRO                              | Aegon                                 |\n| Degroof Petercam Julius B\u00e4r              | ING Groep NIBC Bank                   | ASML Boskalis                         |\n| Lombard Odier                            | Rabobank                              | DSM                                   |\n| Quintet                                  | Rabobank                              | KPN                                   |\n| Vontobel                                 | Rabobank                              | NN Group                              |\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn preparation for the approval of our remuneration policy at the 2024 AGM, we have reconsidered our Management Board peer group, and decided to make changes that will be disclosed in the explanatory notes to the 2024 AGM agenda.\n\nAs for the Management Board's overall total remuneration level, the objective is to remain competitive and to occupy a position below the median of the peer group. When establishing more specific positioning against market data, we take into account that some of the companies are substantially larger than ours. As a result, the current remuneration packages of our Management Board members occupy a position far below the median of the peer group.\n\nFollowing feedback from stakeholders, in 2019 we asked Willis Towers Watson (WTW) to update the market assessment for the Management Board. No changes were made in the companies selected, but we asked WTW to benchmark one level deeper in the organisation for the larger firms in the peer group (at similar job levels). This means that our CEO was compared with positions that report to the CEO (CEO-1 level); for the other Management Board positions, divisional heads were included that report to CEO-1 level (i.e. CEO-2 level). As these positions do not have formal board responsibilities, a standard board premium (in line with market practice) was applied to the base salary levels. Based on this updated analysis, we found that the CEO and CFO are still placed below median market levels (in the 40 th percentile for the CEO and 44 th percentile for the CFO), while the other Management Board members are placed at median market levels.\n\n## Management Board performance\n\nAs indicated in our approach to remuneration, the performance of the Management Board is assessed based on financial and non-financial KPIs. For 2023, the following KPIs (selected from a strategic and stakeholder perspective) were included in the KPIs of the Management Board.

As a specialist wealth manager in the financial sector, Van Lanschot Kempen wants to be able to appoint and retain high-quality Supervisory Board members. The composition of the current peer group is set out in the following table.\n\n| Dutch banks   | Dutch companies with a two-tier board structure   | Dutch companies with a two-tier board structure   |\n|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| ABN AMRO      | Aegon                                             | KPN                                               |\n| ING Groep     | Ahold Delhaize                                    | NN Group                                          |\n| NIBC Bank     | Akzo Nobel                                        | Philips                                           |\n| Rabobank      | ASML Holding Boskalis Westminster                 | Randstad Holding SBM Offshore                     |\n| Rabobank      | DSM                                               | Vopak                                             |\n| Rabobank      | Heineken                                          | Wolters Kluwer                                    |\n\nIn preparation for the approval of our remuneration policy at the 2024 AGM, we have reconsidered our Supervisory Board peer group and decided to make changes.\n\n## Remuneration of other employees\n\nWe aim to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is competitive, performance-related and fair. Our remuneration policy for other employees is in line with our strategy and purpose, and contributes to sustainable longterm value creation.\n\n## Fixed remuneration\n\nEmployees' fixed remuneration reflects their relevant work experience and organisational responsibilities. Our job and career framework consistently links the weight of each job to a pay line. The pay lines are based on external market data and are differentiated to ensure we pay competitive salaries across the organisation. The pay lines are fully transparent, promote better pay-for-performance focus, and have been set up with clear guidelines on pay-related decisions and governance.\n\n## Variable remuneration\n\nOur variable remuneration policy covers all employees. In 2023, the policy was renewed and updated, taking into account factors such as sustainability and a safe working environment. Each individual variable remuneration grant is subject to meeting the criteria as described in this section.\n\nOur variable remuneration policies comply with all relevant laws and regulations. The average variable remuneration of all Van Lanschot Kempen employees who work (largely) in the Netherlands may not and does not exceed 20% of their fixed remuneration. For a small number of employees who are not directly engaged in providing financial services to consumers, we may grant variable remuneration of up to 100% of fixed remuneration. These deviations require separate approval from the Supervisory Board.\n\n## Variable remuneration funding\n\nThe Management Board annually establishes a variable remuneration pool, from which individual variable remuneration awards are made. The size of the pool (or the pool funding) depends on achievement of financial and nonfinancial KPIs, and is subject to Supervisory Board approval. Once the size of the variable remuneration pool has been established, the Management Board decides how the pool will be allocated.\n\n## Variable remuneration allocation\n\nThe individual allocation of variable remuneration depends on individual and team performance, market competitiveness and special factors.\n\nIndividual performance is measured by assessing the achievement of KPIs, as set at the beginning of the year. These indicators can be financial and non-financial, with some departments applying only non-financial criteria. For the departments that use both financial and non-financial indicators, at least 50% of the allocation of any variable remuneration is based on non-financial criteria, such as showing the desired professional behaviour, improving client satisfaction, developing new products or solutions for clients, and improving internal processes, policies or systems. The financial performance indicators include nothing that might encourage irresponsible risk-taking.\n\nVariable remuneration is only awarded if:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows;\n- -It is justified by Van Lanschot Kempen's performance, the relevant client segment and the individual employee;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen meets the prevailing buffer requirements under the EU's Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR), the Dutch Financial Supervision Act (Wft) and its implementing legislation;\n- -The risks taken have been reassessed and no material risks have occurred that were not expected or factored in;",

    {
        "page_content": "- -The employee has received a good performance assessment, has met compliance targets, has not been subject to disciplinary measures, and has not taken any risks that fall outside Van Lanschot Kempen's accepted risk appetite.\n\n## Variable remuneration pay-out\n\nVariable remuneration up to \u20ac50,000 gross is paid out in cash directly. Above this amount, 50% of any variable remuneration is paid out directly, whereas the other 50% is deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on Van Lanschot Kempen meeting the prevailing buffer requirements (as mentioned above).\n\nThe Management Board may, with the approval of the Supervisory Board, hold or claw back all or part of the pay-out if pay-outs have taken place on the basis of incorrect information, or have been made in conflict with the variable remuneration policy and/or applicable legislation and regulations:\n\n- -Deferred, conditional, variable remuneration previously awarded to an employee (or former employee), if payment of the variable remuneration would be considered unfair or unreasonable (hold back);\n- -Unconditional variable remuneration previously paid to an employee (or former employee). This might occur if, for instance, payment was based on incorrect information about performance or about the conditions on which the variable remuneration depended (claw back).\n\n## Remuneration in 2023\n\nVariable remuneration totalling \u20ac18.6 million was awarded to employees (including identified staff) over 2023 (2022: \u20ac21.5 million). Six people received total annual remuneration of over \u20ac1 million in 2023 (2022: six people).\n\n## Equal pay\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen operates a merit-based remuneration policy, seeking not to discriminate on the basis of gender, age, nationality, social status or cultural background. We periodically investigate this and, if necessary, make adjustments to equalise pay. In 2023, we further analysed the gender pay gap at different levels in the organisation to determine whether there are any unexplained differences. Our unexplained gender pay gap rose slightly to 3% in 2023, up from 2.7% in 2022 and above our target range of <2%. For more information, see \"Reducing the gender pay gap\" on page 40.\n\n## Matching Share Plan\n\nOur employee participation plan, also known as the Matching Share Plan, offers an attractive investment opportunity in Van Lanschot Kempen, as well as the chance to share in the company's successes. The investment in Van Lanschot Kempen shares that an employee makes - up to a maximum value of \u20ac3,500 - is matched by Van Lanschot Kempen one year later. The total amount for which Van Lanschot Kempen shares can be purchased at a discount of 18.5% was increased to \u20ac15,000.\n\n## Partnership for leadership\n\nThe reporting year was the second for the Van Lanschot Kempen Partnership: a long-term participation plan for key senior employees. For more information, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 88.\n\n## Pensions\n\nSince 2020, all our employees have been participating in Van Lanschot Kempen's collective defined contribution pension plan. Management Board members do not participate in this plan as they receive an individual pension contribution.\n\n## Remuneration policy for identified staff\n\nIdentified staff are employees whose activities have a material impact on the risk profile of the business. For these employees, performance measurement is the same as for other employees, but additional rules apply for the pay-out of variable remuneration in order to align the interests and risks of the employee with those of the company. On an annual basis, the selection of identified staff is reviewed and approved by the Management and Supervisory Boards.\n\nAs a general rule, any pay-out to identified staff is made 50% in cash and 50% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares. As an exception 15 to this, the variable remuneration of identified staff working at Van Lanschot Kempen Investment Management is paid 50% in cash and 50% in a flexible mix of Van Lanschot Kempen shares and investments in funds managed.\n\nA lock-up period of one year applies to the shares that have become unconditional. In all cases, 60% of the award is paid out unconditionally (both the cash part and the non-cash part), whereas 40% is conditionally deferred for a period of four years. Pay-out of the deferral is conditional on a reassessment of the five conditions mentioned for any award of regular variable remuneration. If this reassessment leads to an adjustment of the deferred remuneration, the hold- and/or claw-back system applies.\n\n## Remuneration policy governance\n\nThe Management Board sets the remuneration policy for employees, based on the advice of several departments: Human Resource Management; Finance, Reporting & Control; Risk Management; and Compliance. These, together with the Internal Audit department, have an important part to play in setting up, adjusting, implementing and reviewing our variable remuneration policy. They advise the Management and Supervisory Boards and report to them on their conclusions.\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for implementing the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board approves the variable remuneration policy, including its general principles, and oversees its implementation. Approval by the Supervisory Board is also required for the variable remuneration pools, any significant 16 individual variable remuneration, and for individual variable remuneration proposed for employees designated as identified staff. The Supervisory Board's Remuneration Committee prepares the Supervisory Board's decision-making on remuneration and advises it in this area.\n\nMore information about the remuneration policy for identified staff can be found in our 2023 Pillar 3 disclosure, available on our website from 7 March 2024: vanlanschotkempen.com/ results.",

The Supervisory Board may dismiss a member of the Management Board at any time, but only after consulting the general meeting.\n\nThe Management Board must consist of at least three members, with the actual number set by the Supervisory Board. The composition of the Management Board did not change in 2023. The Management Board currently comprises Maarten Edixhoven (Chair), Jeroen Kroes (Chief Financial Officer - CFO), Wendy Winkelhuijzen (Chief Risk Officer - CRO), Arjan Huisman (Chief Operating Officer COO), Richard Bruens (responsible for Private Clients Netherlands, Private Clients Belgium and Investment Banking Clients) and Erik van Houwelingen (responsible for Investment Management Clients). On 7 September 2023,\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen announced that Richard Bruens had decided to step down as a member of the Management Board as per 1 June 2024. The Supervisory Board intends to appoint Wendy Winkelhuijzen, currently CRO, as his successor. Since making this announcement, the recruitment and selection process for a new CRO has begun.\n\nThe Management Board evaluates its functioning as a whole and that of individual Board members at least once a year. The Supervisory Board discusses, at least once a year, the performance of the Management Board as a whole and its members' performance individually. For more information about the evaluation of the Management Board's performance by the Supervisory Board, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 92.\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\nIn performing its duties, the Supervisory Board focuses on the interests of the company and its associated business. The members of Van Lanschot Kempen's Supervisory Board are appointed by the general meeting, in accordance with the provisions set out in Article 23 of Van Lanschot Kempen's Articles of Association. Appointment of a member of the Supervisory Board is subject to the approval of DNB. Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed for a term of four years and may be reappointed for one further fouryear period. A member of the Supervisory Board may subsequently be reappointed again for a period of two years, and this appointment may be extended by another two years. In the event of reappointment after eight years, the reasons for reappointment should be given in the Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nA member of the Supervisory Board may only be dismissed by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeal with due observance of Article 161(2) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. In addition, the general meeting may pass a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board as a whole, in accordance with Article 161(a) of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Such a resolution results in the immediate dismissal of all members of the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board must have a minimum of three members and a maximum of nine. The Supervisory Board currently has six members: Frans Blom (Chair), Manfred Schepers (Vice-Chair), Karin Bergstein, Brigitte Boone, Maarten Muller and Elizabeth Nolan. To our great sadness, Lex van Overmeire (member of the Supervisory Board and Chair of the Audit Committee) passed away on 4 April 2023. We will publish the profile for this vacancy at the same time as the agenda for the annual general meeting (AGM) in 2024. At the AGM held on 25 May 2023, Elizabeth Nolan was appointed and Frans Blom was reappointed as a member of the Supervisory Board until the closure of the 2027 AGM.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has appointed four committees from among its members to prepare the Board's decision-making: the Audit Committee, the Risk and Compliance Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the Selection and Nomination Committee. These committees advise the Supervisory Board on matters relating to their respective areas of interest. For more information about the committees and their composition, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 92.",

        "page_content": "The Supervisory Board has drawn up a profile 1 for its size and composition, taking into account the nature and activities of the business associated with Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries, and the required expertise and background of the members of the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance, that of its committees and that of individual Supervisory Board members, at least once a year without members of the Management Board being present. The Supervisory Board appraises its own performance with independent support once every three years. One of the conclusions from the Supervisory Board's self-assessment is that the composition of the Board complies with the requirements set out in the Board's profile. For more information about the conclusions of the Supervisory Board's self-assessment of its performance in 2023, see \"Report of the Supervisory Board\" on page 92.\n\n## Inclusion and diversity policy\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has drawn up an inclusion and diversity policy, which is available on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/inclusion-and-diversity under \"Inclusion and diversity policy\".\n\nUnlocking the potential of diversity first and foremost requires the creation of an inclusive environment, where the distinctive qualities of each individual are welcomed and valued. We aim for diversity not only in terms of gender, nationality, age, educational background, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, ethnic background, disability or distance to the labour market, but also across personal experiences, characteristics, socio-economic backgrounds and the different skills that people bring. We recognise the true value of having diverse perspectives at the table, and also realise it takes time to learn and adapt to get there.\n\nWe intend to increase - on an annual basis - the number of people working with us with a disability or distance to the labour market, and also with an international background. We have set specific targets with respect to gender diversity based on the Act to achieve a more balanced male/female ratio on management and supervisory boards, which came into force on 1 January 2022. We aim for at least one-third women and one-third men in both our Management and Supervisory Boards, and for at least 30% women and 30% men in senior staff positions. For more information about gender diversity in senior staff positions, the action plan and the inclusion and diversity policy for employees, see \"Inclusion and diversity\" on page 40.\n\nWith regard to the composition of our Management and Supervisory Boards, we aim for a reasonable balance across multiple forms of diversity, but do not find it appropriate to set specific diversity targets across all dimensions. That said, we aim to ensure that the combined profiles of the respective Board members enable them to collectively execute their range of responsibilities and duties towards Van Lanschot Kempen to the best of their abilities, taking into account the nature of the business and its activities.\n\nIn implementing our inclusion and diversity policy for the Management and Supervisory Boards, the individual profiles drawn up for vacancies on these Boards take into account the Boards' profiles and the relevant inclusion and diversity criteria and objectives. These profiles form the basis for the recruitment and selection of new members of the Supervisory and Management Boards. These criteria and objectives are also taken into account when evaluating the performance of the Supervisory and Management Boards.\n\nThe Supervisory Board meets the objectives of our inclusion and diversity policy, with its diverse composition in terms of gender, age, nationality, characteristics, educational background, personal experiences and skills that each member brings. This composition enables the Supervisory Board as a group to carry out its responsibilities and duties effectively. The following areas of expertise are represented in the Supervisory Board: executive experience, strategy formulation and execution, banking and finance, asset management, clients and markets, audit, financial reporting, risk management, IT, digitalisation, transformation, sustainability (social and environmental), legal, compliance and remuneration. The Supervisory Board currently has six members - of which three are female - and there is one vacancy. This means that 50% of the positions on the Supervisory Board are currently held by women and that the target for at least one-third of its members to be female/ male, as included in the inclusion and diversity policy, has been met.\n\nThe Supervisory Board has concluded that the composition of the Management Board meets the objectives of our inclusion and diversity policy in most respects. The composition is complementary and there is a sufficient degree of diversity with regard to age, educational background, personal experiences and skills. In terms of gender diversity, the Management Board currently consists of five men and one woman. This means that the target of one-third women has not yet been met, as it stands at 16.7%. The gender diversity in the Management Board has not changed since 2022 because the Board's composition has remained unchanged.\n\nIn order to achieve the gender diversity targets for the Management Board, an action plan has been drawn up, the main elements of which are set out below.\n\n## Inflow - recruitment measures:\n\n- -The final shortlist for Management Board positions should be 50% male and 50% female.\n- -A clear view must be established on the potential external pipeline for talent that might be suitable for future appointment as a member of the Management Board. For this purpose, specialist headhunters, agencies and/or networks will be used.\n- -The requirements for profiles to be drawn up for vacancies in the Management Board will take into account \"diversity in all its forms,\" as defined in the inclusion and diversity policy.",

At the AGM to be held on 23 May 2024, we will inform shareholders about our intention to appoint a female CRO as member of the Management Board on 1 June 2024.\n\n## Dutch Corporate Governance Code\n\nOn 20 December 2022, the revised Dutch Corporate Governance Code 2022 2 (the Code) was published. It came into force as of the 2023 financial year, and contains principles and best practice provisions that regulate relations between the management board, supervisory board and general meeting/shareholders. The Code aims to define responsibilities for sustainable long-term value creation, risk control, effective management and supervision, remuneration and the relationships with shareholders and stakeholders.\n\nIn 2023, we carried out an extensive analysis of the impact of the Code. The by-laws of the Management and Supervisory Boards as well as the terms of reference of the Supervisory Board committees were amended in 2023 in order to comply with the revised Code. We fully complied with the Code in the 2023 reporting year.\n\n## Dutch Banking Code\n\nThe Dutch Banking Code 3 contains principles on sound and ethical business operations, governance, risk policy, audit and remuneration policy. The Banking Code applies to activities performed in, and aimed at, the Netherlands by banks with registered offices in the Netherlands and which hold a banking licence issued by DNB. It therefore applies to Van Lanschot Kempen because we hold a banking licence in the Netherlands.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen complied with the Banking Code in 2023. An explanation (in Dutch) of how Van Lanschot Kempen applied the Banking Code during the reporting year is provided on our website: vanlanschotkempen.com/en-nl/ about-us/who-we-are/governance.\n\n## Capital structure and shares\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's authorised share capital consists of 150 million shares with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each, divided into 75 million Class A ordinary shares and 75 million Class C preference shares. Our outstanding capital consisted entirely of Class A ordinary shares on 31 December 2023; a total of 43,039,938 Class A ordinary shares had been issued. There were no outstanding Class C preference shares in 2023.\n\nIn 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen acquired the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden. The acquisition was paid for in cash (53%) and newly issued shares (47%) under a lock-up provision until 2030. Van Lanschot Kempen issued 1,678,270 new Class A ordinary shares on 6 April 2023. Depositary receipts for these shares were issued, which have been listed on the official market of Euronext Amsterdam (see \"Depositary receipts for shares\").\n\n## Depositary receipts for shares\n\nOver 99.99% of Class A ordinary shares in issue are held by Stichting Administratiekantoor van gewone aandelen A Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting Administratiekantoor'), which has issued depositary receipts for these shares.\n\nThe receipts have been listed on the official market of the Euronext Amsterdam stock market since 1999. A depositary receipt can be converted into its underlying share without any restrictions, although administrative costs may be charged. Stichting Administratiekantoor fully complies with Principle 4.5 of the Code, which specifies that 'Depositary receipts for shares can be a means of preventing a majority (including a chance majority) of shareholders from controlling the decision-making process as a result of absenteeism at a general meeting. Depositary receipts for shares should not be issued as an anti-takeover protective measure.'\n\nStichting Administratiekantoor grants proxies so that holders of depositary receipts can always exercise their voting rights. In the case of shares for which Stichting Administratiekantoor has not granted proxies to the holders of depositary receipts and for which no voting instructions have been received, Stichting Administratiekantoor's Board decides how the votes are to be cast. Stichting Administratiekantoor exercises the voting rights in the interest of the holders of depositary receipts for shares, taking into account the interest of Van Lanschot Kempen, its associated business and all parties concerned. Its Board has three members and is independent of Van Lanschot Kempen. It appoints its own members, without requiring the approval of Van Lanschot Kempen. Before appointing a member, the Board allows the holders of depositary receipts for shares the opportunity to recommend candidates for appointment as members of the Board. A meeting of holders of depositary receipts takes place at least once every two years. At this meeting, the Board reports on its activities, vacancies in the Board, and candidates the Board intends to appoint as members of the Board. Once every two years, the Board requests the holders of depositary receipts at this meeting to confirm their confidence in the Board. At the meeting that was held on 16 November 2022, holders of depositary receipts confirmed this. The Board reports on its activities annually. This report can be found on page 269.\n\n## Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen\n\nA call option contract has been agreed between Stichting preferente aandelen C Van Lanschot Kempen ('Stichting preferente aandelen') and Van Lanschot Kempen, under which Stichting preferente aandelen was granted the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the",

A general meeting, at which a proposal to redeem the preference shares will be placed on the agenda, is to be convened within 12 months.\n\nThe following circumstances may lead to the issuance of Class C preference shares:\n\n- -A concentration of shares or depositary receipts for shares in Van Lanschot Kempen as a result of purchases on the stock market or the purchase of blocks of shares, other than as a pure investment;\n- -Merger talks that do not lead to an agreement;\n- -The announcement of a public bid, whether or not in combination with the above circumstances;\n- -A proposal by a shareholder or holder of depositary receipts for shares to place an item on the agenda that represents a potential threat to Van Lanschot Kempen's continuity, identity and/or independence.\n\n## Interests in Van Lanschot Kempen notifiable under Chapter 5.3 of the Financial Supervision Act\n\nPursuant to the Dutch Financial Supervision Act, shareholders and holders of depositary receipts of Van Lanschot Kempen are required to provide information on their holdings once they cross threshold levels of 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 75% and 95%. As of the publication date of this report, Van Lanschot Kempen is not aware of any shareholders or holders of depositary receipts with an interest of 3% or more in Van Lanschot Kempen other than Stichting Administratiekantoor, Romij BV, LDDM Holding BV, Janus Henderson Group plc, FMR LLC, MVDP NV and J.B. Meulman. For more information on Van Lanschot Kempen's shareholders, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 88. Stichting preferente aandelen has reported a potential interest of 100% in Van Lanschot Kempen under the call option agreement between Stichting preferente aandelen and Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn 2023, no transactions took place between Van Lanschot Kempen and any natural person or legal entity holding at least 10% of the shares in Van Lanschot Kempen, and which would be material to Van Lanschot Kempen and/or the person/entity involved.\n\n## Rights of shareholders\n\nSince there are exclusively Class A ordinary shares in issue at present, this section only describes the rights of holders of Class A ordinary shares and depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Dividend\n\nThe portion of the profit remaining after addition to the reserves is at the disposal of the general meeting. In the event that a loss is incurred over a year, which cannot be covered by a reserve or by some other means, no profit distribution will occur in subsequent years until such time as this loss has been absorbed. A dividend on ordinary shares can only be paid out when the dividend proposal has been approved by the general meeting. Van Lanschot Kempen checks whether the proposed dividend satisfies the European Central Bank's recommendation on dividend payment policies. For more information on our dividend policy, see \"Van Lanschot Kempen shares\" on page 88.\n\n## Pre-emption rights\n\nWhen ordinary shares are issued, each existing holder of ordinary shares has a pre-emption right proportionate to the aggregate nominal amount of the existing holding of ordinary shares. Class A ordinary shares are issued to holders of Class A ordinary shares. The same applies to the grant of rights to acquire ordinary shares. Pre-emption rights can be limited or excluded by resolution of the Management Board, any such resolution being subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board. The relevant authority of the Management Board ends as soon as its authority to issue shares expires (see 'Share issues').\n\nShareholders do not have any pre-emption rights on shares issued in exchange for a non-cash contribution. Nor do shareholders have any pre-emption rights on shares or depositary receipts for those shares issued to employees of Van Lanschot Kempen or another group company.\n\n## Special rights of shareholders\n\nThere are no special statutory control rights attached to shares in Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen signed a shareholder agreement with LDDM Holding BV in 2011. In it, LDDM Holding affirms that it will respect Van Lanschot Kempen's independence. LDDM Holding will not cooperate with the acquisition by a third party of a shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen exceeding 25% of the issued share capital without the approval of the Management and Supervisory Boards. In the event of any future share issues, Van Lanschot Kempen will give LDDM Holding the opportunity, subject to certain conditions, to keep its relative shareholding in Van Lanschot Kempen at the same level. As long as LDDM Holding retains an interest of at least 7.5% in Van Lanschot Kempen, it has the right to recommend one person for appointment as a member of the Supervisory Board of Van Lanschot Kempen. Maarten Muller currently serves on the Supervisory Board on LDDM Holding's recommendation.\n\n## Restrictions on voting rights and deadlines for exercising voting rights\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has not imposed any restrictions on the exercise of voting rights. In principle, voting rights are exercised at the general meeting by the shareholder or the person authorised by the shareholder to that end. A shareholder is entitled to vote at the general meeting if the shares in question are registered in the shareholder's name on the registration date (see 'General meeting'). Holders of depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares who register on time to attend the general meeting are granted a proxy by Stichting Administratiekantoor. They can use this proxy at the general meeting to exercise the voting rights on the shares held by Stichting Administratiekantoor, and in exchange for which depositary receipts were issued. Proxies will be provided when the depositary receipt holders sign the attendance list prior to the start of the meeting or, in the case of a hybrid meeting, at the moment they log in to the designated platform to attend the virtual meeting. If the depositary receipt holder's right to attend the meeting is to be exercised by a representative authorised in writing, Stichting Administratiekantoor will grant a proxy to the representative. Shareholders and holders of depositary receipts for shares are also offered the opportunity to issue a voting instruction to an independent third party prior to the general meeting. The notice convening the relevant general meeting will state to whom this voting instruction should be sent and what the deadline is for submission.",

        "page_content": "## Share issues\n\nThe extent of the Management Board's authority to decide on a share issue (subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board) is determined by a resolution of the general meeting. The duration and granting of this authority are also determined by resolution of the general meeting and may not exceed five years. The Management Board's authority to issue ordinary shares, including the granting of rights to acquire these shares, was extended at the AGM held on 25 May 2023 for a period of 18 months from the date of that meeting. The authority to issue these shares is limited to 10% of the issued capital.\n\n## Repurchase of shares\n\nRepurchases of paid-up shares in the company or depositary receipts for such shares, other than for no consideration, may take place if the general meeting has authorised the Management Board to this effect. This authorisation applies for up to a maximum of 18 months. Repurchase occurs pursuant to a decision by the Management Board, subject to Supervisory Board and DNB approval.\n\nThe Management Board was authorised at the AGM held on 25 May 2023 to repurchase paid-up ordinary shares in the company or depositary receipts for these shares, by buying such shares on the stock market or otherwise, up to a maximum of 10% of the issued capital at the date of authorisation, subject to Supervisory Board approval. This authority has been granted for a period of 18 months from the date of the meeting.\n\n## Transfer of shares and depositary receipts\n\nThe Articles of Association and the conditions of administration do not contain any restrictions on the transfer of Class A ordinary shares or depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares.\n\n## Amendment to the Articles of Association\n\nA resolution to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen may only be adopted based on a proposal by the Management Board that has been approved by the Supervisory Board. If a proposal to amend the Articles of Association is presented to the general meeting, a copy of the proposal will be made available to the shareholders and holders of depositary receipts prior to the meeting.\n\n## General meeting\n\nEach voting shareholder and depositary receipt holder is authorised, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing, to attend the general meeting, to address the meeting and to exercise their voting rights. A registration date applies to each general meeting, which is the 28 th day prior to that meeting. The registration date determines who qualifies as a voting shareholder or depositary receipt holder for the relevant general meeting. The notice convening the meeting states the registration date, the way in which shareholders and depositary receipt holders can register and how they can exercise their rights, either in person or through a representative authorised in writing.\n\nShareholders and depositary receipt holders or their representatives are only admitted to the meeting if they have informed Van Lanschot Kempen in writing of their intention to attend, and if this has been done in the manner described in the notice convening the meeting. Access to the meeting is only possible if the relevant shares or depositary\n\nreceipts are registered in the name of the shareholder or the depositary receipt holder on the registration date. Representatives must also present a written proxy. A written proxy may be sent electronically. Each share entitles the holder to cast one vote at the general meeting.\n\nThe powers of the general meeting include the following:\n\n- -Approving decisions of the Management Board to make important changes to the identity or nature of the company or the business;\n- -Appointing members of the Supervisory Board on the Supervisory Board's recommendation;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Supervisory Board;\n- -Passing a motion of no confidence in the Supervisory Board;\n- -Setting the remuneration policy for the Management Board;\n- -Approving schemes in the form of shares and/or rights to acquire shares for the Management Board;\n- -Adopting the financial statements;\n- -Disposing of the profit remaining after dividend has been distributed to any outstanding Class C preference shares, and after the decision has been made to add all or part of the profit to the reserves;\n- -Discharging the Management Board;\n- -Discharging the Supervisory Board;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to issue shares and to limit or exclude pre-emption rights on the issue of shares;\n- -Granting the Management Board the authority to repurchase the company's own shares;\n- -Resolving to amend the Articles of Association of Van Lanschot Kempen, to dissolve Van Lanschot Kempen, or to effect a legal merger or demerger of Van Lanschot Kempen, following a proposal to that effect by the Management Board which has been approved by the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn addition, the general meeting has an advisory vote with regard to the remuneration report.\n\n## Main features of Van Lanschot Kempen's management and control system\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's management and control system is designed to manage internal and external risks. This includes the management of financial and non-financial reporting risks, to ensure reliable financial and non-financial reporting and financial statements that are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and which comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen applies the three lines of defence model for the management of risks. The first line of defence is operational management, responsible for day-to-day risk management. The second line of defence is provided by departments such as Financial Risk Management, NonFinancial Risk Management and Compliance, which oversee the first line's risk management activities. The Internal Audit department acts as the third line of defence, providing an independent evaluation of the adequacy of the internal risk management and control systems. The three lines of defence model provides the Management Board with a reasonable degree of certainty as to how the internal risk management and control system is functioning, including the effectiveness of the risk management activities of both the first and second lines. The Internal Audit department is responsible for carrying out operational and IT audits. All of its reports",

Management ensures adequate follow-up and prioritisation of actions to improve the internal risk management and control system. Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit monitor timely follow-up of the actions, and validate the adequacy of the resolutions implemented. If necessary, supplementary control measures are defined to mitigate risks sufficiently.\n\nThe risk & control framework's effectiveness is evaluated by the Risk Management and Compliance departments, while the Internal Audit department also assesses its quality and effectiveness through audit engagements. The results of these evaluations feature in these departments' quarterly reports.\n\nFor more detailed information on risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen, see \"Risk and capital management\" on page 65. The financial statements also include a more detailed explanation of risk management at Van Lanschot Kempen: see 'Risk management' on page 144.\n\n## Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for the design and operation of an adequate system of internal control for Van Lanschot Kempen's financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting. The financial statements must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and must comply with the prevailing legislation and regulations.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has processes and tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -The Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles regarding financial accounting;\n- -A risk & control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -Evaluation of the functioning of the internal risk management and control system by the Internal Audit department. The main findings are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board, and discussion of the annual report by the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board.\n\nIn-control statements are provided by the management of the relevant departments. These are based on the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the results of testing procedures for the risk & control framework, the follow-up of the test results and reported risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance evaluated the 2023 in-control statements.\n\nIn 2023, the main findings of the Internal Audit department's quarterly reports were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit Committee. The conclusions of the Audit Committee were subsequently shared with the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe Supervisory Board was informed about the Management Board's internal control of the organisation, and how it safeguards the integrity of financial information. The subjects considered by the Supervisory Board when assessing the financial statements include the board report and the audit report prepared by the external auditors.\n\nThe key audit findings and other observations cited in the independent external auditors' report were discussed with the Management Board and the Audit Committee, and formed part of the organisation's risk management and control. Non-financial information is subject to internal controls and reviews, whereas the sustainability reporting is drawn up in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards and Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) requirements, and is subject to a limited assurance engagement performed by the independent external auditors.\n\n## Statement by the Management Board\n\nIn accordance with best practice provision 1.4.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Management Board states that:\n\n- -The management report provides sufficient insights into any failings in the effectiveness of the internal risk management and control systems related to strategic risks, operational risks, compliance risks and financial reporting risks;\n- -The aforementioned systems provide reasonable assurance that the financial reporting does not contain any material inaccuracies;\n- -Based on the current state of affairs, it is justified that the financial reporting is prepared on a 'going concern' basis;\n- -The management report states those material risks related to the aforementioned risk types and uncertainties that are relevant to the expectation of the company's continuity for the period of 12 months after the preparation of this report;\n- -Based on the analysis of in-control statements and the quarterly reports from Risk Management, Compliance and Internal Audit, it is justified to state that the financial statements are free of any material misstatements caused by fraud.\n\n## External auditors\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers Accountants NV (PwC) were reappointed as Van Lanschot Kempen's external auditors for the 2024 financial year at the AGM held on 25 May 2023. PwC's audit plan for 2023, of which the audit risk assessment is an integral part, was discussed in June 2023 at meetings of the Management Board and the Audit Committee.\n\nPwC issued a board report for 2023 in February 2024, outlining their main observations regarding their audit of the 2023 financial statements. The external auditors may be questioned at the AGM in relation to their audit, and will be attending the meeting for this reason. The Management Board and the Audit Committee evaluated the functioning of PwC in January 2024.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of significant accounting principles\n\n## General\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen NV is an independent specialist wealth manager. Our purpose is to preserve and create wealth for our clients and for society in a sustainable way. Van Lanschot Kempen NV (\"Van Lanschot Kempen\") has its registered office at Hooge Steenweg 29, 5211 JN 's Hertogenbosch, the Netherlands. Van Lanschot Kempen is a public limited company incorporated under Dutch law and registered under number 16038212 at the Chamber of Commerce. Depositary receipts for Class A ordinary shares are publicly traded on the Euronext markets.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen at 31 December 2023 were prepared by the Management Board and approved by the Supervisory Board on 21 February 2024, and will be submitted to the annual general meeting of shareholders for adoption on 23 May 2024.\n\n## Basis of preparation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU), and with Part 9, Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. Unless stated otherwise, assets and liabilities are measured at historical cost.\n\n## Continuity\n\nThe Management Board has examined the ability of Van Lanschot Kempen to continue its operations. The Management Board is not aware of any material uncertainties that cast significant doubt on our - i.e. Van Lanschot Kempen's - ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on this basis.\n\n## Economic context\n\nAfter a resilient economy in the first half 2023, longer-dated interest rates declined in the second half, while stock prices rallied towards year-end. Inflationary impacts from 2022 continued to trickle through to the rest of the economy, and many collective labour agreements (CLAs) were negotiated at substantial increases. Because energy prices peaked late in 2022, the overall inflation figure for 2023 was almost nil. The ECB has responded with a further tightening of monetary policy. A lot is still unknown about the impact of these and future developments on the private clients, entrepreneurs and family businesses we finance. That said, the impact of current economic circumstances is considered to be limited for Van Lanschot Kempen. In general, we have not experienced major disquiet among our clients, either existing or new.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's capital and liquidity positions remain robust and our net result in 2023 amounted to \u20ac125.2 million (2022: \u20ac84.3 million).\n\nIn 2023, the impact on our credit portfolio of the uncertain economic circumstances was limited. This is reflected in a decrease in loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) and a lower management overlay at year end. The\n\nmanagement overlay takes into account uncertainties in the economic outlook/macroeconomic climate which are not yet considered to be fully reflected in the model parameters. For more information, see \"Risk management\", under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit losses (including sensitivity analyses we have performed). Developments following the collapse of several banks in the US have also increased our attention to our amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) bond portfolios. The negative revaluation, when measured at fair value, remains limited for both portfolios and we carefully assess the duration of both portfolios in isolation, as well as in the general scope of balance sheet steering. Aside from the impact on our own balance sheet, we've also seen a marked decrease in deal flow in our Investment Banking segment. This led to a loss in this segment in the first half of 2023, but after we took decisive action it made only a marginal impact on the bottom line in the second half of 2023. Especially in the real estate sector, the unprecedented rise in interest rates has led to very seriously diminished deal flow as market participants had to reevaluate their strategies and portfolios. The end of the year was marked by some green shoots and we were able to complete several deals for our clients.\n\n## Functional and reporting currency\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are denominated in euros, Van Lanschot Kempen's functional and reporting currency. Unless stated otherwise, all amounts are presented in thousands of euros. The totals may not always match the sum of the individual values due to rounding.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe accounting policies adopted in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 remain unchanged from the prior year, except for the adoption of new standards and interpretations effective from 1 January 2023.\n\n## Changes in published IFRS standards and interpretations\n\nThe IFRS standards listed below became effective from 1 January 2023 and have been applied to our financial statements for 2023. The application of these standards had no material impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's equity or result. Application of the amended standards generally entails amendment or expansion of notes.\n\n## Definition of Accounting estimates - Amendments to IAS 8\n\nThe amendments clarify the distinction between changes in accounting estimates and changes in accounting policies and the correction of errors. They also clarify how entities use measurement techniques and inputs to develop accounting estimates. The amendments should provide guidance for entities in determining whether changes are to be treated as changes in estimates, changes in policies, or errors. The amendments apply to changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates that occur on or after the start of the effective date.",

        "page_content": "## Disclosure of Accounting Policies - Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2\n\nThe amendments provide guidance and examples to help entities apply materiality judgements to accounting policy disclosures. The amendments intend for entities to disclose more useful accounting policy disclosures by replacing the requirement for entities to disclose their \"significant\" accounting policies with a requirement to disclose their \"material\" accounting policies. In addition, guidance is provided on how entities apply the concept of materiality in making decisions about accounting policy disclosures.\n\n## Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction - Amendments to IAS 2\n\nThe amendments clarify that where payments that settle a liability are deductible for tax purposes, it is a matter of judgement (having considered the applicable tax law) whether such deductions are attributable for tax purposes to the liability recognised in the financial statements (and interest expense) or to the related asset component (and interest expense). This judgement is important in determining whether any temporary differences exist on initial recognition of the asset and liability.\n\nUnder the amendments, the initial recognition exception does not apply to transactions that, on initial recognition, give rise to equal taxable and deductible temporary differences. It only applies if the recognition of a lease asset and lease liability (or decommissioning a liability or decommissioning an asset component) give rise to taxable and deductible temporary differences that are not equal.\n\nNevertheless, it is possible that the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities are not equal (e.g. if the entity is unable to benefit from the tax deductions or if different tax rates apply to the taxable and deductible temporary differences). In such cases, an entity would need to account for the difference between the deferred tax asset and liability in profit or loss.\n\nAn entity should apply the amendments to transactions that occur on or after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. In addition, at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented, it should also recognise a deferred tax asset (provided that sufficient taxable profit is available) and a deferred tax liability for all deductible and taxable temporary differences associated with leases and decommissioning obligations.\n\n## International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules Amendments to IAS 12\n\nThe amendments introduce a mandatory temporary exception from recognition and disclosure of information about deferred taxes arising from the jurisdictional implementation of the Pillar 2 model rules. Entities are required to disclose known or reasonably estimable information on the entity's exposure to Pillar 2 income taxes.\n\n## Published IFRS standards and interpretations not yet effective\n\nIn addition to the IFRS standards and interpretations referred to above, a number of IFRS standards and interpretations are new or have been amended, and apply to financial statements for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024. We have not applied the standards outlined below in the 2023 financial statements. Unless stated\n\notherwise, standards will be applied as soon as they become effective and have been endorsed by the EU.\n\n## Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback - Amendments to IFRS 16\n\nThe amendment specifies the requirements that a sellerlessee uses in measuring the lease liability arising in a saleand-leaseback transaction, to ensure the seller-lessee does not recognise any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains. The amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2024 and must be applied retrospectively for sale-andleaseback transactions entered into after initial application of IFRS 16. The amendment is not expected to have a material impact on the results or equity of the company.\n\n## Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current and Non-current Liabilities with Covenants - Amendments to IAS 1\n\nThe amendments clarify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. Entities need to consider whether some of the amendments may impact their current practice and covenant testing. We currently apply the exception provided by IAS1.60 and no distinction is made between current and non-current liabilities in the financial statements. The amendments are therefore not expected to have a material impact on the results or equity of the company.\n\n## Significant accounting judgements and estimates\n\nWe have identified those accounting policies which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. In the process of applying these accounting policies, we use estimates, assumptions and judgements which can have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the most recent information available and include the impact of the uncertain economic circumstances caused by developments around the war in Ukraine among other factors. The actual amounts may differ in the future. Where applicable, the impact of the uncertain economic circumstances on assumptions used are explained further in the consolidated financial statements. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the determination of significant influence, fair value of financial instruments, acquisitions, impairments of financial assets, and the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Determination of significant influence\n\nWe have applied critical judgement to determine significant influence in companies in which we hold minority interest smaller than 20%. Our influence on the financial and operating policy decisions at some minority interest is more in line with that in an associate, e.g. veto rights in decisions on the issuance of new shares and decisions on amendments to the Articles of Association. For that reason, we classify these as associates and apply equity accounting instead of IFRS 9 fair value accounting. For further information, see the disclosure on Investments in associates using the equity method.",

        "page_content": "## Determination of fair value\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market is determined on the basis of cash flow, option and other valuation models. These models are based on the market circumstances prevailing at the reporting date.\n\nEstimates mainly relate to future cash flows and discount rates. For the fair value level classification and more details, see 'Risk management', under 14, Fair value.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nIn the case of acquisitions, it is necessary to determine the fair value of the acquired assets (including any intangible assets and goodwill acquired), as well as of liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position. Estimates are used for this, particularly for those items not traded on an active market. Management consideration is also needed to determine the moment of the change of control and thus the moment of consolidation of an acquired entity.\n\n## Impairments of financial assets\n\nWe recognise a loss allowance for expected credit losses (ECL) on financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (OCI), as well as for financial guarantees and loan commitments. When there has been no significant deterioration in credit risk since initial recognition, ECL is recognised based on a 12-month expected credit losses (Stage 1). When a significant increase in credit risk has occurred, ECL is recognised based on a lifetime expected credit losses (Stage 2). For impaired loans (Stage 3), a lifetime ECL is recognised. The impairments of financial assets are determined as a critical estimate. For more information on deterioration in credit risk, see 'Risk management', under 3.8, Loss allowance for expected credit losses.\n\n## Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nWe calculate the recoverable amount for each cashgenerating unit (CGU) or group of CGUs as the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs of disposal and its value in use. The value-in-use calculation reflects an estimate of future cash flows, base-case scenario analysis and discount rates. The fair value less costs of disposal calculation uses price-earnings multiples of our peer group and future cash flows are used. Future cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and different types of investigation into possible trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on these estimates include market expectations, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in client relationships, cost structure, trends in interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. We carried out an annual impairment test on goodwill arising from acquisitions in prior years. For more information on the assumptions used, see Note 10, Goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life.\n\n## Other accounting estimates\n\n## Impairments of non-financial assets\n\nThe recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of the fair value of the asset less costs to sell and its value in use. This fair value less costs to sell is the price that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid on the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the valuation date. To determine whether assets are impaired, the individual assets are allocated to the lowest level at which cash flows can be identified (cashgenerating units). Non-financial assets that have been subject to impairment, other than goodwill paid, are reviewed annually to determine whether the impairment can be reversed. Non-financial assets, other than goodwill paid, are tested for impairment annually by assessing whether there are any indications that these assets are impaired.\n\n## Deferred tax assets\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset. Estimates are used when determining future taxable profits, since these are inherently subject to uncertainty.\n\n## Actuarial assumptions for provisions\n\nPension liabilities are determined using actuarial calculations. These calculations use assumptions regarding elements such as the discount rate, future trends in salaries and returns on investments. These assumptions are subject to estimation uncertainty. See Note 17, Provisions.\n\n## Other provisions\n\nOther provisions are determined on the basis of the most recent estimates of the expected costs. The timing of the cash outflow related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and time required to conclude these claims and obligations. In determining these provisions, where applicable, we take into consideration the opinion of legal experts.",

        "page_content": "## Basis of consolidation\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen comprise the financial statements of Van Lanschot Kempen and its subsidiaries. These have been prepared at 31 December 2023 using accounting policies consistent with those used in the previous year, and their financial year is concurrent with the calendar year.\n\nSubsidiaries (including the consolidated structured entities) are associates in which Van Lanschot Kempen exercises decisive control. Van Lanschot Kempen has decisive control over an entity when it has power over that entity and is exposed to or has rights to variable income from its involvement in the entity, and is able to use its power over the entity to influence the entity's income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the entity. Factors taken into account include existing and potential voting rights. A right is a material right if its holder is able to exercise that right in practice.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has power over an entity if its existing and potential voting rights amount to more than 50%. If these rights amount to less than 50%, Van Lanschot Kempen determines whether it has power over the entity pursuant to contractual agreements. In making this assessment, a distinction is made between substantive and protective rights. Substantive rights are rights which enable the decision-making power of an enterprise to be influenced directly and which give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. Examples include the right to appoint and dismiss members of the Management Board, and to set the level of their remuneration. Protective rights are rights which protect the interests of an entity in another entity, but which do not directly confer decision-making powers. Protective rights do not give Van Lanschot Kempen decisive control over an entity. When acquiring non-controlling interests, Van Lanschot Kempen in principle includes only protective rights in the contractual agreement. These are rights of approval which enable Van Lanschot Kempen to protect its minority position without acquiring decisionmaking power. Examples of protective rights are rights of approval in respect of the issue of shares and effecting significant acquisitions.\n\nIntra-group transactions are eliminated in the consolidation process. Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of incorporation or acquisition, being the date on which Van Lanschot Kempen acquires control, and are consolidated until the date that such control ceases.\n\nWe consolidate interests in investment funds if we have power over the investment fund and are exposed to or have rights to variable income stemming from our involvement and are able to use our power over the investment fund to influence the variable income. The assessment of control is based on the actual relationship between Van Lanschot Kempen and the investment fund. Van Lanschot Kempen takes into account its interest for its own account and its own role, or that of one of its group companies, as fund manager.\n\nIn the case of subsidiaries not fully controlled by Van Lanschot Kempen, the non-controlling interest in equity is presented separately in the consolidated statement of financial position as a component of total equity. The profit or loss for the reporting period that can be attributed to the non-controlling interest is disclosed separately.\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nAcquisitions are recognised using the acquisition method. Accordingly, the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the fair value of the acquired assets (inclusive of any intangible assets not previously recognised in the statement of financial position), liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position.\n\nGoodwill, being the difference between the cost of the acquisition (including assumed debts) and our interest in the fair value of acquired assets, liabilities and obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position at the acquisition date, is capitalised as an intangible asset. If this difference is negative (negative goodwill), it is taken directly to the statement of income. Goodwill is not amortised. For more information on its valuation, see Note 10, Goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\nA non-controlling interest in the company acquired is recognised at the fair value prevailing on the acquisition date or at the proportionate share in the identifiable assets and liabilities of the company acquired. Results of companies acquired are disclosed in the statement of income from the date at which control is obtained.\n\nAdjustments to the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities at the acquisition date which are identified within 12 months of the acquisition may lead to adjustment of goodwill. Adjustments identified after expiry of one year are disclosed in the statement of income.\n\nOn disposal of group companies, the difference between the sale proceeds and the acquisition cost (including goodwill) is included in the statement of income together with any unrealised gain or loss.",

        "page_content": "## Summary of material accounting policies\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\n## Functional currency\n\nItems in the statement of financial position pertaining to each group company are stated in the currency of the economic environment in which the entity operates (i.e. the functional currency).\n\n## Group companies\n\nThe assets, liabilities, income and expenses of group companies that use a functional currency other than the reporting currency are translated as follows:\n\n- -Assets and liabilities are translated using the closing exchange rate at the reporting date;\n- -Income and expenses are translated using the rate prevailing on the transaction date;\n- -Remaining exchange-related gains or losses are recognised as a separate component of equity.\n\nUpon consolidation, exchange-related gains or losses arising from monetary items forming part of a net investment in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity. Exchangerelated gains or losses on borrowings and other items designated as hedging instruments for such investments are also recognised in equity.\n\n## Transactions and line items\n\nOn initial recognition, transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction date. Translation differences arising on the settlement of such transactions or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the statement of income, except where they are recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges or qualifying net investment hedges in foreign subsidiaries.\n\nIn general, translation differences in the statement of income are included in the result on financial transactions. Translation differences on non-monetary items measured at fair value through profit or loss are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss. Non-monetary items are translated into the reporting currency at the same time as the determination of their fair value. By translation on the reporting date, currency translation differences on nonmonetary items measured at fair value through equity are included in the revaluation reserve in equity.\n\nNon-monetary items not measured at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the original transaction date.\n\n## Recognition of financial assets in the statement of financial position\n\nPurchases of financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss whose value is subject to change, or financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income, or other financial assets at amortised costs, which are settled according to standard market conventions, are recognised on the transaction date, i.e. the date on which we undertake to purchase or sell the asset concerned. Loans and advances are recognised on the settlement date, i.e. the date on which we receive the asset.\n\n## Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities in the statement of financial position\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when:\n\n- -Our rights to the cash flows from the asset expire;\n- -We have retained the right to receive the cash flows from an asset, but have an obligation to pay these in full to a third party under a special agreement;\n- -We have transferred our rights to the cash flows from the asset and have transferred substantially all the risks and rewards;\n- -We have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards but have transferred control over the asset.\n\nIf we have transferred our rights to the cash flows from an asset, but have not transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset and have not transferred control, the asset is recognised as long as we have continued involvement in the asset.\n\nA financial liability is derecognised as soon as the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired.\n\n## Special purpose entities\n\nWe have placed parts of our loan portfolio in special purpose entities (SPEs), which comprise only covered bond companies. If we have effective control over an SPE, it is consolidated. We have control over an entity when we have power over that entity and are exposed to or have rights to variable income from our involvement in the entity and are able to use our power over the entity to influence the entity's income.\n\nThe accounting principles followed by Van Lanschot Kempen are applied when consolidating SPEs.\n\n## Transfers of financial assets\n\nAll or a part of a financial asset is transferred if:\n\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are transferred; or\n- -The contractual rights to receive the cash flows from that financial asset are retained, but a contractual obligation is assumed to pay the cash flows to one or more recipients under an arrangement.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nA derivative is initially recognised at fair value on the effective date of the contract. After initial recognition, the derivative is subsequently remeasured at fair value and changes in value are taken to the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. Fair values are based on stock exchange prices, cash flow models, or option and other valuation models.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nWe use derivatives, such as interest rate swaps, to hedge our exposure to interest rate risks. The carrying amount of assets and liabilities which are hedged through fair value hedging and which would otherwise be recognised at cost is adjusted for changes in the fair value that can be attributed to the hedged risks. Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives not relating to the hedged risks are taken directly to the statement of income.",

        "page_content": "At the inception of a hedge transaction, we formally designate and document the hedge relationship and the financial risk management objective when entering into the hedge transaction. The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how we will assess the hedging instrument's effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to risks.\n\nHedges that qualify for hedge accounting are recognised as follows:\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nFair value hedges are hedges of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability arising as a result of interest rate changes. Changes in the value of the hedging instrument are taken to the statement of income.\n\nAny change in the fair value of the hedged item is also recognised in the statement of income, in so far as the hedging instrument has been effective in the preceding period.\n\nA hedge relationship ends if the hedging instrument is sold, expires or is exercised, or if the hedging transaction no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, with the remaining value adjustment of the hedged item amortised through profit or loss until the end of its term.\n\nWe apply micro fair value hedge accounting and macro fair value hedge accounting.\n\n## Micro fair value hedges\n\nFrom 1 January 2022, we have applied hedge accounting for micro fair value hedges based on IFRS 9. A fair value hedge is classified as a micro fair value hedge when the hedged item (or group of items) is a distinctively identifiable asset or liability hedged by one or a few hedging instruments. Debt securities at fair value through other comprehensive income and issued debt securities are hedged for interest rate risk in a micro fair value hedge. Effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. If necessary, adjustments are made to the hedge relationship.\n\n## Macro fair value hedges\n\nWe apply macro fair value hedges for fixed rate mortgages. A portfolio of mortgages is identified comprising homogeneous loans based on their contractual interest rates, maturity and other risk characteristics. Mortgages within the identified portfolio are allocated into repricing term buckets based on expected repricing dates rather than contractual repricing dates. The hedging instruments are designated appropriately to those repricing term buckets.\n\nSuch hedges are considered to be effective if we may expect, both upon inception and during the term of the hedge, that changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item will be almost fully offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedging instrument, in so far as they relate to the hedged risk, and the actual outcome is within a range of 80-125%. Effectiveness is assessed and documented on a monthly basis in order to determine that the hedge has been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which it was intended. We apply the EU carve-out on portfolio fair value hedges.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nCash flow hedges are hedges of the exposure to fluctuations in the cash flow of an asset, liability or future transaction arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation. The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity until the hedged item affects the statement of income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the statement of income.\n\nIf the hedging instrument expires or is sold, or if it can no longer be designated as a hedge, accumulated gains and losses remain in equity until the expected future transaction is taken to the statement of income. If the expected future transaction is no longer likely to take place, the accumulated result is transferred directly from equity to the statement of income.\n\n## Embedded derivatives\n\nFinancial assets with embedded derivatives are considered in their entirety when determining whether their cash flows are solely payment of principal and interest.\n\nIf the hybrid contract contains a host that is not an asset, the embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and treated as separate derivatives when:\n\n- -The economic characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract;\n- -A separate instrument with the same terms would meet the definition of a derivative;\n- -The hybrid contract is not measured at fair value through profit or loss.\n\n## Day 1 profit\n\nDiscrepancies between the transaction price and the fair value may arise if valuation techniques are applied at the time of the transaction. Such a discrepancy is referred to as a Day 1 profit. Any resulting profit or loss is recognised directly in the statement of income if the valuation method is based on observable inputs in an active market. In the event of unobservable inputs, the gain or loss is amortised over the term of the transaction.\n\n## Netting of financial assets and liabilities\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are netted and presented in the consolidated financial statements at the net amount when we have a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. See 3.7, Risk management.\n\n## Statement of financial position\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks\n\nCash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks comprise, at nominal value, cash in hand and deposits with a term of less than three months, investments readily convertible into a known amount of cash with an insignificant risk of value changes, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks in respect of which the risk of value changes is insignificant. The amount due from De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) arising from the minimum reserve requirement is also included in this item, as well as the irrevocable payment commitments cash collateral regarding the Single Resolution Fund.",

        "page_content": "## Due from banks\n\nAmounts due from banks are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives are carried at fair value. The positive and negative values of derivatives are shown separately on the face of the statement of financial position on the assets side and the liabilities side, respectively. The values of derivatives with a positive and negative value, concluded with the same counterparty, are only netted if the cash flows are settled on a net basis and this is permitted under law. Changes in the value of derivatives are taken directly to the line item Result on financial transactions. If the hedge is completely effective, the net impact on the statement of income is nil. The difference, in so far as this remains within the ranges set, reflects ineffectiveness and is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Derivatives include:\n\n- -The fair value of derivatives held for trading Derivatives held for trading include transactions for own account whereby the aim is to actively sell them in the short term. Client option positions whereby offsetting market transactions are conducted for all option positions held by our clients on a one-on-one basis are also included in this item;\n- Economic hedges are derivatives used to manage risks\n- -Economic hedges without applying hedge accounting;\n- -Structured product derivatives Structured product derivatives are instruments to hedge structured products sold to clients, without application of hedge accounting;\n- -Derivatives with application of hedge accounting These are derivatives used as hedging instruments in the application of hedge accounting.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) are measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVPL). Additionally, any instrument for which the contractual cash flow characteristics are not solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at FVPL. No restrictions are set for sales within the fair value through profit or loss portfolio. Interest earned on these assets is recognised as interest income under Other interest income. All other realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring debt instruments at fair value are recognised under Result on financial transactions. All realised and unrealised gains and losses on remeasuring equity instruments at fair value are recognised under Income from securities and associates.\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets from trading activities. These are transactions for our own account whereby the aim is to actively sell these instruments in the short term. Financial assets from trading activities consist of the trading portfolio of both equity instruments and debt instruments. The financial assets from trading activities are recognised at fair value with effect from the trade date and value adjustments are taken to the statement of income under Result on financial transactions.\n\n## Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect and sell business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at fair value, with fair value adjustments recognised in Other comprehensive income unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Sales as a result of managing everyday liquidity needs, maintaining a particular interest yield profile on the secondary market, or to match the duration and sales required by regulators, are consistent with the objective of the hold to collect and sell portfolio.\n\nUnder FVOCI, a financial asset is measured at its fair value and changes in the carrying amount are taken through OCI, except for the recognition of impairment gains or losses, interest revenue and foreign exchange gains and losses on the instrument's amortised cost which are recognised in the statement of income. When the financial asset is derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from equity to the statement of income and recognised in Result on financial transactions. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest method.\n\n## Loans and advances to the public and private sectors\n\nLoans and advances to the public and private sectors are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and are subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. The loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised in the statement of income.\n\n## Other financial assets at amortised cost\n\nA debt instrument that is held within the hold to collect business model and meets the SPPI test is measured at amortised cost unless the asset is designated at fair value through profit or loss. Under this measurement category, the financial asset is initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset, and subsequently recognised at amortised cost less the principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount and adjusted for any impairment allowance. The impairment is recognised in the statement of income. Interest income from these financial assets is included in Interest income using the effective interest rate method.\n\n## Investments in associates using the equity method\n\nThese investments have been designated by management as transactions held indefinitely, and as a result of the acquired control can be classified as investments in associates using the equity method. These are investments in entities where we have significant influence but not control. If there is a change in the equity of the associate, we recognise our share in this change and include it in Other comprehensive income. This also applies to results of associates recognised in our statement of income.\n\nIn the first year of investment, investments classified as investments in associates using the equity method are recognised at cost, and where applicable are adjusted for any changes in the value of the associate's individual receivables",

The valuation methods applied to assess the carrying value are the capitalisation method (peer group analysis), the discounted cash flow method and the disclosed net asset value method. An impairment is recognised if the recoverable amount is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nThe capitalisation method determines the value of a business by multiplying the operating profit (EBIT) and the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by a multiplier factor derived from similar listed companies (the peer group), if applicable also taking account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholding. EBIT and EBITDA are adjusted for one-off items where applicable.\n\nThe discounted cash flow method calculates the enterprise value by discounting the forecast operational cash flows at a discount rate for the planning period and a final value based on the extrapolation of the operating profit.\n\nThe discount rate is determined on the basis of the discount rate of listed companies with a high degree of similarity and on the specific characteristics of the company. If applicable, the discounted cash flow method takes account of a discount for poor liquidity and minority shareholdings.\n\nThe company's net debt is then deducted from the value resulting from the capitalisation method and/or discounted cash flow method and multiplied by the share in the capital structure in order to derive the shareholder value from the enterprise value.\n\nThe disclosed net asset value method determines the value of a company based on the statement of financial position.\n\nIf our share in the associate's losses is equal to or exceeds our interest in the associate, no further losses are recognised unless we have assumed obligations or made payments for these associates.\n\n## Property and equipment\n\nProperty and equipment comprise buildings in own use, right-of-use assets, operation system software and information technology, communication and safety equipment, renovation & refurbishment, and furniture and fixtures. Property and equipment are initially carried at cost and subsequently measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairments. The carrying value includes the costs for replacement of part of the existing property as soon as these costs are incurred, but excludes day-to-day servicing costs. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the useful life of the asset.\n\nLease contracts which we entered into as a lessee are classified as right-of-use assets. Right-of-use assets are presented as part of Property and equipment in the statement of financial position and are measured at cost, comprising the following:\n\n- -The amount of the initial measurement of the lease liability;\n- -Any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received;\n\n- -Any initial direct costs;\n- -Restoration costs.\n\nDepreciation is applied using the same method as for whollyowned tangible assets.\n\nThe recoverable amount of individual property items within the different CGUs or group of CGUs is determined every year, irrespective of whether there is any indication of impairment, and more often if market conditions so dictate. The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. The fair value less costs to sell is determined by an independent surveyor. If the fair value less costs to sell is below the carrying amount, the value in use is determined. This value is calculated using the value-in-use method. If the value in use is also below the carrying amount, an impairment is recognised for the difference between the carrying amount and the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.\n\n| Estimated useful life of property and equipment (years)   | Estimated useful life of property and equipment (years)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Buildings                                                 | 25-40                                                     |\n| Right-of-use assets                                       | 1-10                                                      |\n| Operating system software and IT                          | 3-5                                                       |\n| Communication equipment                                   | 5                                                         |\n| Safety equipment                                          | 15                                                        |\n| Renovation & refurbishment                                | 10-15                                                     |\n| Furniture and fixtures                                    | 5-10                                                      |\n\nOperating system software expenses are capitalised if they are identifiable, if there is a likelihood that future economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and if costs can be measured reliably.\n\n## Goodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the acquired assets (including intangible assets) and liabilities, and the purchase price paid (excluding acquisition costs). Goodwill paid is included in the financial statements at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill paid is tested for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. An impairment is calculated based on the difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. A CGU's recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and its value in use.\n\nThe fair value less costs of disposal uses price-earnings multiples for our peer group and estimated future cash flows. The value in use is determined by discounting the future equity cash flows generated by each CGU or group of CGUs to their net present value using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs. If the recoverable amount of a CGU is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired. The impairment is first applied in full to the goodwill and then pro rata to the individual assets.\n\nOther intangible assets with a finite useful life, such as client relationships, brand names and application software, are capitalised at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their respective useful lives. For acquired intangible assets, an annual useful life test is conducted to assess indications of impairment. For client relationships, changes in AuM",

Current and deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if they relate to the same tax authority, concern the same type of tax, if it is permitted under law to offset these tax positions and if the tax positions are expected to be settled simultaneously.\n\nDeferred taxes are recognised on the face of the statement of financial position if the valuation of an asset or liability temporarily differs from the valuation for tax purposes. Deferred taxes are calculated using the tax rates prevailing on the reporting date. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that taxable profits will be realised in the near future against which these temporary differences can be offset.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are assessed at every reporting date and derecognised to the extent necessary. This derecognition will be reversed if it is probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available.\n\nChanges in the value of investments at fair value through other comprehensive income and movements in the value of derivatives forming part of a cash flow hedge are recognised in equity net of deferred tax. Deferred tax assets and liabilities cease to be recognised when these movements in value are realised. Current tax is taken to the statement of income on realisation of the movement in value.\n\n## Other assets\n\nOther assets comprise interest receivables, commission receivables and other receivables, and are carried at the lower of cost or the recoverable amount. This recoverable amount is the estimated selling or settlement price in the ordinary course of business less the relevant variable costs to sell. The recoverable amount less the relevant variable costs to sell is based on the appraisal value as determined by an independent surveyor if applicable. Other assets are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Due to banks\n\nAmounts due to banks are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Public and private sector liabilities\n\nPublic and private sector liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\n## Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise financial instruments which management believes should be recognised at fair value through profit or loss based on one of the following reasons:\n\n- -Designation eliminates or significantly reduces inconsistencies in measurement and recognition which would otherwise arise as a result of liabilities being valued or income and expenses being recognised under different accounting policies; or\n- -The contract in which the financial instrument is included contains one or more embedded derivatives and the entire contract is recognised at fair value through profit or loss. This is only permitted if the embedded derivative has significant influence on the contractually agreed cash flows.\n\nThe valuation takes account of our own credit risk. Own credit risk is recognised in equity under the line item Other reserves. See also Note 21, Total equity. The remaining amount of change in the fair value of the financial liabilities at fair value is recognised in Result on financial transactions and Net interest income for the interest charges on medium term notes.\n\nFinancial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities from trading activities. These are transactions for own account whereby the aim is to repurchase these instruments in the short term. These instruments are stated at fair value, with movements in value recognised in the statement of income under Result on financial transactions. This line item comprises short positions on the trading portfolio in both equity instruments and debt instruments. Recognition is from the date on which the contract is concluded.\n\n## Issued debt securities\n\nIssued debt securities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, issued debt securities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Repurchase of our own debt securities is offset in the consolidated financial statements against the liability; the difference between the cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Provisions\n\nA provision is a liability of uncertain timing or amount. A provision is included in the statement of financial position if we have an obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions are discounted if the time value of money for the liability has a material effect. The most material types of provisions are the provision for pensions, provisions for long-service benefits and restructuring provisions.\n\n## Provision for pensions\n\nWe operate defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. Under defined contribution plans, contributions to pension providers are taken to the statement of income as staff costs. We have no further payment obligations with respect to defined contribution plans once the contributions have been paid.\n\nA defined benefit plan is a pension plan which defines the amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement. Factors such as age, years of service and salary",

The obligation is calculated on an actuarial basis.\n\n## Restructuring provision\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised only if the recognition criteria are met. We have a constructive obligation if we have a detailed formal restructuring plan identifying at least the business or part of the business concerned, the principal locations affected, the number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the expenditure to be undertaken and a suitable timeframe. Employees are also notified of the main features of the plan.\n\n## Other liabilities\n\nOther liabilities are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After their initial recognition, they are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\n\nLease liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as part of Other liabilities. Interest payments and amortisation in the year are charged to the statement of income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and disclosed within the statement of income.\n\nLease liabilities consist of interest and amortisation payments and are initially measured at the present value of the remaining lease payments, discounted using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate.\n\n## Subordinated loans\n\nSubordinated loans are initially recognised at fair value excluding transaction costs. After initial recognition, they are carried at amortised cost. Purchases of our own subordinated loans are offset against the liability in the consolidated financial statements. The difference between cost and the carrying amount based on the remaining term is taken to the statement of income.\n\n## Equity\n\nDirect costs of new share issues are deducted from equity, taking account of taxes.\n\nIf we purchase treasury shares, the purchase price, including direct transaction costs after tax, is deducted from equity. Treasury shares that we purchase do not qualify for profit or dividend and are not included in the calculation of earnings per share.\n\n## Obligations not recognised in the statement of financial position\n\nThis includes obligations that represent a potential credit risk and where it is either not probable that it will lead to an outflow of resources or that a reliable estimate can be made. For the other obligations not recognised in the statement of\n\nfinancial position, see 'Commitments' in the supplementary notes.\n\n## Contingent assets and liabilities and irrevocable commitments\n\nContingent liabilities are carried at the contract value and relate in particular to guarantees and irrevocable letters of credit. This item consists of unused overdraft facilities, sale and repurchase commitments, irrevocable payment commitments for the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) and all other obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could give rise to loans.\n\n## Statement of income\n\n## General\n\nRevenue is recognised when it is likely that the economic benefits will flow to Van Lanschot Kempen and the revenue can be measured reliably. Costs are allocated as far as possible to the period in which the services were rendered or to the relevant proceeds.\n\n## Net interest income\n\nThis item consists of income earned on lending and costs of borrowing, derivatives, related commission, and other income/expense similar to interest. The amortisation of remaining value adjustments on mortgage portfolios of fair value hedges which expired in the past is presented under Interest income.\n\nInterest income and interest expense are recognised in the statement of income on an accrual basis, using the effective interest method. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated cash flows over the life of the financial instrument, or a shorter period when appropriate, to the net carrying amount of the financial asset or liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, we take into account all contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example early repayment) but not future losses due to uncollectible amounts.\n\nNegative interest paid is recognised under Interest income, and negative interest received is recognised under Interest expense.\n\n## Income from securities and associates\n\nAll dividends received from investments in equity instruments are recognised directly in the statement of income under Other income from securities and associates when they are made payable. Our share in the results of equity-valued associates is recognised under Income from securities and associates using the equity method. Dividends received are deducted from the carrying amount of the equity-valued associate. Due to the fact that these investments in associates using the equity method are part of our investment strategy, we present income from these as part of our operating activities. This line item also includes results realised on the sale of associates using the equity method, which are recognised upon closing of the transaction.\n\n## Net commission income\n\nThis item comprises the income, other than income similar to interest, earned on wealth management services provided to third parties. It also includes fees charged to managed investment funds. Commission paid to third parties is accounted for as commission expense. We receive",

        "page_content": "commission for the wide range of services we provide to clients. This can be divided into commission on a transaction basis and periodic commission charged to the client during the year.\n\n## Commission on a transaction basis\n\nCommission income on a transaction basis is recognised in the periods in which we provide the services. Transaction commission for which we only provide a service on the transaction date (e.g. commission on buying and selling shares) is taken directly to the statement of income. Transaction commission for which we have to provide a service in the future (e.g. commission on structured products) forms part of the amortised cost and is recognised in the statement of income over the expected term of the instrument.\n\n## Periodic commission\n\nPeriodic commission (e.g. management fees) is recognised in the statement of income in the period in which the services are provided.\n\n## Result on financial transactions\n\nResult on securities trading includes realised and unrealised value differences on gains and losses on financial instruments relating to the securities trading portfolio. Exchange and price gains and losses on trading in other financial instruments are recognised under Result on foreign currency trading. Gains and losses due to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting are recognised under Unrealised gains/ losses on derivatives under hedge accounting. When financial assets at fair value through OCI are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss is reclassified to Realised gains or losses on financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income. Result on economic hedges includes realised and unrealised gains and losses on derivatives that are not included in a hedge accounting model. Result on financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss comprises unrealised value differences and interest expenses on financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss with the exception of the interest charges on medium term notes, which are recognised under Net interest income.\n\n## Other income\n\nOther income comprises income from categories not listed above, for example income resulting from the consolidation of non-banking subsidiaries.\n\n## Staff costs\n\nStaff costs comprise wages and salaries, pension and early retirement costs, other social security costs and other staff costs such as remuneration in the form of share-based employee benefits.\n\n## Share-based payments\n\nEmployees may be eligible to receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments. The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which the equity instruments are granted. The fair value is determined based on the share price on the grant date, taking into account the discounted value of expected dividends over the vesting period. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, in the period in which the employee's performance criteria are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the employee becomes fully entitled to the award (the vesting date).\n\n## Partnership plan and partnership investment incentive\n\nThe partnership plan is a participation plan that allows key senior staff to contribute to and participate in the success of Van Lanschot Kempen. Its purpose is to anchor leadership more broadly in our organisation, to further encourage ownership and entrepreneurial spirit, and to create more long-term alignment with our shareholders and clients. Partners' contributions remain in the partnership during their full tenure as a partner. Partners receive a discount of 18.5% as their interest is subject to a lock-up period of five years. This discount is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment, and it is recognised immediately as an expense, with a corresponding increase in equity.\n\nThe purpose of the partnership investment incentive is to enhance return perspectives. If awarded, a partnership investment incentive will apply with respect to the contributions made in the relevant contribution round for five financial years and will be calculated at the end of each of those years in accordance with the partnership investment incentive formula. Since the entitlement to the partnership investment incentive for a financial year is subject to continued service until the end of the financial year and the actual performance achieved, the estimated cost is recognised over the relevant vesting period.\n\nThe partnership investment incentive will be paid to partners in two components: 70% in Van Lanschot Kempen shares and 30% in cash. The portion settled in shares is accounted for as an equity-settled share-based payment and the portion settled in cash is accounted for as a long-term employee benefit.\n\n## Other administrative expenses\n\nOther administrative expenses are allocated to the period in which the products and services are delivered.\n\n## Depreciation and amortisation\n\nDepreciation and amortisation costs are determined on the basis of estimated useful life and charged to the statement of income.\n\n## Impairments\n\nThis item comprises the balance of the required impairments and reversals of such impairments, including those on financial instruments, on investments in associates using the equity method, on property and equipment, and on goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Income tax\n\nTax on operating profit is recognised in the statement of income in accordance with applicable tax law in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax effects of any losses incurred in certain jurisdictions are recognised as assets when it is probable that sufficient future profits will be available in the relevant jurisdiction against which these losses can be offset.\n\n## Earnings per ordinary share\n\nEarnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit for the year available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated by dividing the profit available to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, adjusted for possible dilution as a result of, for example, outstanding option rights.",

It distinguishes between cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities. Cash flows from operating activities include net changes in loans and advances, deposits from/with banks, public and private sector liabilities, and dividends received from investments in equity instruments. Investing activities include acquisition, redemption and sales of debt instruments, equity investments, associates using the equity method, property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, and dividend received from investments in associates using the equity method. Financing activities include issues and repayments of share plans, debt instruments and issued debt securities, and dividends and capital returns paid to shareholders. Cash and cash equivalents comprise, at face value, all cash in hand, balances at central banks and balances withdrawable on demand at other banks. Investing and financing transactions that do not require the use of cash or cash equivalents are excluded from the statement of cash flows.\n\n## Segment information\n\nThe different operating segments form the basis for our primary segmentation. An operating segment is a business unit that can earn revenues and incur expenses and whose operating results are regularly reviewed by management or the chief operating decision maker and for which discrete financial information is available. Additional information is reported geographically based on where the business activities are located. Intra-segment transactions are conducted on commercial terms and market conditions (at arm's length).",

The risk management function - which comprises Compliance, Financial Risk Management and NonFinancial Risk Management - supports the front office, clients and other stakeholders in ensuring that the risks taken by Van Lanschot Kempen are controlled and comply with our risk appetite and legal requirements. This section describes our risk appetite, the organisational and governance arrangements that are in place regarding risk management, and the three lines of defence principle. After describing these general arrangements, the section continues with credit risk, market risk, settlement risk, credit valuation adjustment (CVA) risk, strategic risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, securitisation risk, climate change and sustainability risk, operational risk, compliance risk, financial reporting risk and assets at fair value.\n\n## 1.1  Risk appetite\n\nSolid capital and liquidity ratios are essential prerequisites for a successful proposition to our clients and the financial stability of Van Lanschot Kempen in general. This is reflected in our risk appetite statement. We aim to have a simple and transparent balance sheet.\n\nWe have a robust risk appetite framework in place. Every year, the Management Board assesses and updates the risk appetite statement, which translates our risk appetite into strategic limits. The risk appetite statement is then submitted to the Supervisory Board for review and approval. Quarterly risk appetite reports serve as important discussion documents for the continuous review of our risk profile.\n\n## 1.2  Organisation of risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe purpose of our risk management framework is to identify and analyse risks at an early stage, as well as to mitigate and monitor those risks. Adequate internal control procedures and reporting systems, including the application of standards and limits, are key elements of our risk management framework.\n\nThe organisation of our risk management framework is based on the three lines of defence principle. Day-to-day responsibility for risk control lies with the front office and/or operational departments (the first line of defence), including Internal Control and Finance, Reporting & Control.\n\nCompliance, Financial Risk Management and Non-Financial Risk Management form the second line of defence for financial and non-financial risks. These departments are responsible for initiating risk policies and the supervision of controls within Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nInternal Audit forms the third line of defence and is responsible for performing independent audits on activities of the first and second line. The department reports to the Chair of the Management Board and to the Chair of the Audit Committee. The three lines of defence set-up creates a clear, balanced and appropriate division of tasks, powers and responsibilities, and ensures independent and effective operation of the risk management function.\n\nFinancial Risk Management and Asset & Liability Management (ALM) stand at the core of capital management. We actively manage our capital base to cover risks inherent to our business and meet the capital adequacy requirements of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB). The adequacy of our capital is monitored by using the rules and ratios established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision as transposed into EU law through the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR). This legal framework also forms the basis for supervision by DNB through the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) and the Financial Supervision Act (Wft). Over the reporting period, we fully complied with all capital requirements. Both external and internal capital adequacy targets are taken into account, and the central focus is on safeguarding our financial solidity and stability. Each year, a capital and funding plan is prepared for capital management purposes.\n\n## Table 1.2 Risk, capital management and compliance framework\n\nSupervision\n\n1.2.1\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n- - Risk and Compliance Committee\n- - Audit Committee\n\n## Risk, capital management and complianc e\n\n1.2.2\n\n## Management Board\n\n- - Group Risk Committee\n- - Credit Risk Committee\n- - Market Risk Committee\n- - Asset & Liability Committee\n- - Sustainability Board\n- - Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n\n## Implementation and review\n\n1.2.3\n\nFinancial Risk\n\nManagement,\n\nNon-Financial Risk\n\nManagement, and\n\nCompliance\n\nInternal Audit\n\nAsset & Liability Management\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control\n\nExecution\n\n1.2.4\n\nClient\n\nManagement & Origination\n\nInvestment\n\nStrategies &\n\nSolutions\n\nTreasury\n\nCredit Approval and Financial Restructuring & Recovery",

        "page_content": "## 1.2.1 Supervision\n\nThe Supervisory Board oversees the risks and capital requirements in relation to the group's operations and portfolio composition.\n\nThe Risk and Compliance Committee focuses on all identified risks in the group's business activities, as well as the risk management framework. Compliance risks and matters regarding duty of care are also discussed in this committee, which also prepares decision-making by the Supervisory Board on risk matters.\n\nThe Audit Committee is tasked with advising the Supervisory Board on financial reporting, internal and external audits.\n\n## 1.2.2 Risk, capital management and compliance\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for developing and executing Van Lanschot Kempen's strategy. This includes our capital and funding plan, which is based on a number of risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\nThe primary objective of our capital management is to ensure that we comply with external and internal capital requirements in order to support our businesses and to create value for our stakeholders. We manage our capital structure by taking into account changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of our activities. To maintain and/or manage our capital structure, we may adjust the amount of dividend payments to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue capital securities. These adjustments are under constant review by the Management Board. Lastly, requests or demands by our supervisors DNB and/or ECB can also influence capital management.\n\nThe Management Board also bears responsibility for ensuring the proper operation of the processes that safeguard the group's liquidity and capital position. In addition, it is required to provide information to the Supervisory Board, which in turn assesses the risk appetite of the group. To ensure the various risk types are managed properly, the Management Board has set up the following risk and compliance committees:\n\n## Group Risk Committee\n\nThe Group Risk Committee, discusses group-wide risk management themes.The committee brings together, discusses and monitors the various risk types on an integrated level. The committee sets the annual risk appetite statement and discusses the risk appetite report and emerging trends in the risk profile. Other areas covered include recovery and resolution planning.\n\nThe committee includes all members of the Management Board. The CRO chairs this committee, with other members representing Financial Risk Management, Non-Financial Risk Management and Compliance.\n\n## Credit Risk Committee\n\nThe Credit Risk Committee sets and adjusts the group's overall credit risk policy and translates this into acceptance and portfolio management policies. In executing its tasks, the committee bears in mind our strategic objectives and the guiding principles informing the risk appetite statement. The committee is also responsible for all IRB and IFRS models.\n\nThis committee includes the CRO and the Management Board member responsible for Client Management & Origination. The CRO chairs this committee; other members represent Financial Risk Management, Private Clients and Credit Approval and Financial Restructuring & Recovery.\n\n## Market Risk Committee\n\nThe Market Risk Committee focuses on all market risks within Van Lanschot Kempen. Market risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates (excluding interest rate risk in the banking book), exchange rates and equity prices. It also considers variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility and correlations, which also influence the value of certain financial instruments. Market risks at Investment Banking Clients arise from securities trading to facilitate our clients (mainly equities and equity derivatives). Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to a certain amount of market risk (mainly foreign exchange and structured products activities) through its treasury activities. Our foreign exchange risk is limited, as transactions involving currency exchanges are offset in the market within very tight limits. Van Lanschot Kempen is also exposed to market risk as a result of management book investments.\n\nThis committee includes the CRO and the CFO. The CRO chairs the committee, with other members representing Financial Risk Management, Investment Banking, Trading & Sales and Treasury.\n\n## Asset & Liability Committee\n\nThe Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) is responsible for managing risks that result from mismatches between assets and liabilities (interest rate and liquidity risks), as well as the capital position of the bank. ALCO's main task is to  oversee the asset and liability management process. The committee sets policies on interest rate risk in the banking book 1 , liquidity and funding risk, funds transfer pricing and capitalisation, and it monitors the development of the balance sheet and balance-sheet projections.\n\nThis committee includes the Chair of the Management Board, the CRO, the CFO and the Management Board member responsible for Client Management & Origination. The CFO chairs the committee, with other members representing ALM, Treasury, Financial Risk Management and Finance Reporting & Control.\n\n## Compliance & Operational Risk Committee\n\nThe Compliance & Operational Risk Committee is responsible for the implementation and execution of our compliance and operational risk management policies. The committee assesses compliance and operational risks, and ensures remedial actions are taken where required. The committee also challenges and approves the annual plans of the NonFinancial Risk Management and Compliance departments. Among other matters, the root causes of major operational risk incidents are discussed in this committee.",

The CRO chairs this committee, with other members representing Non-Financial Risk Management, Compliance and Financial Risk Management. The Head of Internal Audit has a standing invitation to attend.\n\n## Sustainability Board\n\nThe Sustainability board is responsible for driving and implementing the sustainability strategy for Van Lanschot Kempen and is accountable for embedding sustainabilityrelated goals in our own organisation, our balance sheet and our investments. In addition, the Sustainability Board is the risk owner for all sustainability-related risks within Van Lanschot Kempen and responsible for all sustainabilityrelated policies, KPI setting, risk appetite setting and sustainability monitoring.\n\nThe Sustainability Board is chaired by the CEO, with the Management Board member responsible for Investment Management clients and other members representing Private Clients, Financial Risk Management, Compliance, Strategy, IT and Procurement.\n\nSecond-line departments (FRM, NFRM and Compliance) take the lead in preparing the meetings of the committees described above, with the exception of ALCO, where Asset & Liability Management is in charge, and the Sustainability Board, where the Corporate Sustainability Centre is in charge. We also have a number of committees that form part of the first line of defence and that cover specific risk-related topics, such as the Credit Committee and Client Management & Origination's Product Approval & Review Committee.\n\n## 1.2.3 Implementation and review of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nImplementation and monitoring of our risk and capital policies is carried out by Financial Risk Management, NonFinancial Risk Management, ALM and Finance, Reporting & Control. In addition, Compliance carries out the implementation, monitoring and/or review of compliance policies.\n\n## Financial Risk Management is responsible for:\n\n- -Second-line monitoring and management of all risks relating to the statement of financial position at group level, including modelling, measuring, managing and reporting on our credit, market, interest rate, liquidity and strategic risks;\n- -The risk appetite process;\n- -Preparing, developing and maintaining policy documents;\n- -Issuing daily market risk reports;\n- -Proactively and reactively providing advice on managing risks;\n- -Raising risk awareness among staff in order to improve their ability to strike a sound balance between risk and return.\n\nNon-Financial Risk Management is responsible for:\n\n- -Business continuity management;\n- -Information security (second-line monitoring);\n- -Preparing, developing and maintaining policy documents;\n- -Proactively and reactively providing advice on managing risks;\n\n- -Raising risk awareness among staff in order to improve their ability to strike a sound balance between risk and return.\n\nFinancial Risk Management and ALM are responsible for:\n\n-\n\n- Preparing ICAAP and ILAAP documentation as well as the recovery plan.\n\nFinance, Reporting & Control is responsible for the financial accounting and business control function. Through its various reports, Finance, Reporting & Control fulfils an important role in challenging the businesses. These reports include monthly management reports and cost control reports, and are used to monitor the progress of business plans.\n\nCompliance has both an advisory and a monitoring role with respect to compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies and procedures, and industry standards relevant for Van Lanschot Kempen. As compliance risks are part of Van Lanschot Kempen's overall risk governance, Compliance as an independent function is involved in and supports the management of compliance risks by identifying, assessing, monitoring and reporting on such risks. Compliance risks include risks such as personal data integrity, financial crime, business conduct and client protection risks.\n\nInternal Audit periodically reviews parts of the design and effectiveness of the risk organisation and the execution of our risk, capital management and compliance policies in accordance with their annual audit plan. The applicable policies form the starting point for the independent review by Internal Audit. Processes, infrastructure, organisation and systems are audited based on these policies in order to determine whether the organisation adequately executes its risk, capital management and compliance policies.\n\n## 1.2.4 Execution of risk, capital management and compliance policies\n\nClient Management & Origination (CMO) and Investment Strategies & Solutions (ISS) prepare their own business plans. On the basis of these plans, current and future risks are assessed, including expected capital and liquidity requirements. These assessments serve as input for the various risk committees.\n\n## 1.3 Capital requirements\n\nThe standards set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and translated into law and regulations (CRR and CRD, Wft), apply to all Dutch banks. The Basel framework consists of three pillars:\n\n- -Pillar 1 stipulates capital requirements for credit, market and operational risk.\n- -Pillar 2 requires banks to have internal processes for risk management and to calculate the capital requirements needed to address all risks that are not included in Pillar 1. The Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP) is also part of Pillar 2.\n- -Pillar 3 sets out requirements for disclosure of information about the institution's risk profile to external stakeholders.\n\nOur website provides Pillar 3 disclosures (unaudited) including a detailed breakdown of our portfolio of loans to companies and institutions. Meanwhile, our remuneration policy is explained both in a remuneration section of this annual report and a Pillar 3 disclosure (unaudited), both also on our website.",

        "page_content": "## 1.4 Individual risks\n\nThe following sections detail the individual risk types to which we are exposed. They therefore cover a combination of Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 capital requirements. The risk types covered are:\n\n- -Strategic risk (Section 2);\n- -Credit risk (Section 3);\n- -Market risk (Section 4);\n- -Settlement risk (Section 5);\n- -CVA risk (Section 6);\n- -Interest rate risk (Section 7);\n- -Liquidity risk (Section 8);\n- -Securitisation risk (Section 9);\n- -Climate change and sustainability risks (Section 10);\n- -Operational risk (Section 11);\n- -Compliance risk (Section 12);\n- -Financial reporting risk (Section 13).\n\n## 2. Strategic risk\n\nStrategic risk can be defined as the threat to our results or equity arising from a failure to respond (adequately) to changes in external factors or from incorrect strategic decisions. External factors include the actions of competitors, clients, potential market entrants and public authorities. Strategic risk is not inherently undesirable, since there can also be an upside to taking these risks. We take a forwardlooking approach to strategic risk, keep a close eye on external developments and set our strategic priorities accordingly. Our strategy puts a strong focus on organic and inorganic growth to profit from economies of scale. Existing risk management practices and measures are assessed regularly to ensure that possible new risks that may arise from changes in strategic direction or in the business environment are addressed adequately.\n\n## 3. Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty or client is no longer able to fulfil its obligations. Our credit risk policies focus on the counterparty risks associated with lending to private clients and SMEs. Strict selection criteria for new clients and active credit management for existing clients are applied to safeguard the quality of the loan portfolio. Our lending activities are required to be in line with stated objectives, and individual assessments are used to ascertain this.\n\nAs well as from lending activities, credit risk also arises from:\n\n- -Investment activities;\n- -International payment transactions and cash management;\n- -FX and hedging activities;\n- -Settlement risk.\n\nOur investment activities relate to the management of our liquidity buffer and equity investments. For the liquidity buffer, a limit framework is in place to manage and monitor associated credit risks.\n\nCounterparty credit risk with respect to financial institutions arises from international payment transactions, cash management, FX and hedging activities. Some of these activities also involve settlement risk. For derivatives transactions, counterparty credit risk is mitigated by daily margining.\n\nWe apply a strict policy when determining and monitoring country and counterparty (financial institutions) limits. The\n\ncountry limits serve as a cross limit for financial institutions, meaning that the counterparty risks in respect of financial institutions in one country are limited by the relevant country limit, as the country limit is usually lower than the aggregate of the individual counterparty limits.\n\nLimits on financial institutions and countries are determined using a number of hard criteria such as external ratings, BIS ratios, capital ratios, country of origin and gross domestic product (for countries). Limits can also be adjusted and withdrawn on a daily basis.\n\n## 3.1 Loans and advances\n\n## 3.1.1  Credit acceptance\n\nOur loan approval policy focuses on maintaining a highquality loan portfolio. The credit risk concentration mainly lies within our Private Clients segment in the Netherlands. Loan reviews and the authority to approve loans are delegated to a limited number of teams, mainly our Credit Approval team.\n\nThe authority to approve large loans rests with the Credit Committee, which comprises representatives of the relevant divisions as well as members of the Management Board.\n\nThe mid- and back-office for nearly all residential mortgage loans is carried out by a third party. A service level agreement (SLA) is in place to ensure adequate control of the operational risks, including the outsourcing risk.\n\nThe acceptance process is not outsourced, with the exception of our white label loans - residential mortgages offered by a third party. The acceptance and management of credit risks has been outsourced to this third party, within our strict guidelines and in accordance with prevailing legal requirements.\n\nNew loan requests are assessed to determine if they are in line with our strategy and policies, and we adopt a conservative approach to granting them.\n\n## 3.1.2  Credit management - policy and processes\n\nTo achieve and attain a high-quality loan portfolio, strict credit management is required. Credit management is carried out at both individual loan and portfolio level. At the individual loan level, explicit attention is devoted to the management of unauthorised overdrafts and accounts past due. Loans with an elevated risk profile are subjected to a risk check. In addition, a portion of the portfolio is regularly reviewed and the credit risk of individual clients is scrutinised as part of this review. The frequency of reviews varies according to the individual borrower's risk profile, but they take place at least annually. In addition to financial analyses, reviews take account of future developments in a client's situation (partly in the light of relevant macroeconomic trends).\n\nA deterioration in a client's risk profile may lead to closer supervision, an adjusted rating, corrective measures (such as requiring additional collateral or increasing the frequency of financial reporting), involvement of the Credit Approval and Financial Restructuring & Recovery department or a combination of these measures. It may also lead to a stage transfer under IFRS 9 - see Section 3.8.\n\nAt portfolio level, credit risks are monitored on a monthly basis. In addition, several early warning indicators are used to",

A detailed credit risk report and any relevant developments or expected developments are discussed in the Credit Risk Committee on a quarterly basis. Any negative trend identified in the risk profile of a particular client segment, sector or loan type, can lead to the adjustment of the relevant lending policy. Trends in sectors where there is a concentration risk are monitored particularly closely.\n\nIf the review, risk check, payment arrears or external signals point to an increased risk of discontinuity, the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team is involved in the credit management process. An estimate is made of the probability of continuity. Depending on the seriousness and magnitude of the problem, either monitoring or intensive supervision is applied. If there are objective indicators of impairment the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team draws up an impairment proposal. The Impairment Committee determines the impairment for the whole credit portfolio on a quarterly basis.\n\nActive management of past due loans enables potential problem loans to be identified at an early stage. If an individual assessment identifies an increased risk, the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team will supervise the client. Increased credit risk occurs in situations including the following:\n\n- -If clients fail to meet their payment obligations;\n- -If clients report difficulties in meeting future payments, e.g. because of a divorce, unemployment etc.;\n- -In the event of a default (see Section 3.1.3);\n- -For business clients, in the event of a significant decrease in turnover, breach of one or more covenants, a debt service coverage ratio < 1, etc.\n\nThe primary goal of the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team is to migrate clients back to accounts with regular status (i.e. not under the supervision of Financial Restructuring & Recovery) by reducing their credit risk. The aim is to do this in accordance with the loan agreements made with these clients, but forbearance measures are applied if necessary. For more information on forborne exposures, see Section 3.2.\n\n## 3.1.3  Credit risk measurement\n\nWe have developed internal models for measuring and monitoring credit risk for the majority of the loan portfolio. Some of these internal models are also used to determine the required capital that has to be set aside for absorbing unexpected credit losses. For this reason, the models, the use of these models and the model governance have to adhere to strict requirements set out in the CRR.\n\nThe CRR distinguishes three approaches for determining the required capital for credit risk: the standardised approach (SA), the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) approach, and the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach. We use SA and A-IRB for our loan portfolios.\n\nThe standardised approach prescribes a set of rules for determining the required capital based on various characteristics such as client type, loan type, collateral type, and external rating. Under A-IRB, banks are allowed to use own estimates for probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD) and loss given default (LGD). PD is defined as the likelihood that a client will default within one year, the EAD is defined as the bank's expected exposure at the time a client defaults, and the LGD is the expected loss percentage\n\nin the event that a client defaults. As a result, A-IRB is more risk-sensitive than SA.\n\nWe have approval from DNB to determine and report the required regulatory capital for our residential mortgage exposures portfolio using the A-IRB approach. Our models are captured by our model governance framework.\n\nAs part of this, the performance of our A-IRB models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated against independent models.\n\nThe PD model is mostly based on behavioural aspects of the client and the LGD models on the underlying collateral. For the capital calculations a so-called downturn LGD is applied, i.e. the expected loss at default during an economic downturn. Estimation of the EAD is based on the limit and credit utilisation.\n\nThe SA method has been used for capital calculations in all our other retail and non-retail portfolios.\n\n## IRB equity portfolio\n\nThe IRB equity portfolio includes our positions in equities in the investment portfolio, subordinated receivables, noncontrolling interests and shareholdings which appear on Van Lanschot Kempen's company statement of financial position. We use the simple risk-weighted method to calculate the risk-weighted assets for positions in shares.\n\nIn this method, a specific risk weighting (190%, 290% or 370%) is assigned to each position, based on a number of characteristics. A risk weighting of 250% is applied for significant investments in financial institutions that are not deducted from equity because they fall below the regulatory threshold. Positions taken in shares and subordinated loans of wholly owned subsidiaries are excluded from IRB. These are reported using the SA method.\n\n## Other loans and advances\n\nThe risk-weighted assets of other portfolios, such as the debt securities in our investment portfolio managed by the Treasury department (i.e. excluding retail, non-retail and equity), are calculated on the basis of the SA method.\n\n## Definition of default and credit-impaired assets\n\nOur definition of default is informed by EBA guidelines. Most notably, the materiality threshold complies with the uniform European standard. A financial asset is credit-impaired when one or more events have occurred that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows:\n\n- -A breach of contract such as a more than 90 days past due event with a materiality of more than \u20ac100 and more than 1% of total credit obligation (retail exposures) or more than \u20ac500 and more than 1% of total credit obligation for non-retail exposures;\n- -Significant financial difficulty of the issuer or the borrower and an inability to meet future payments;\n- -Concession(s) granted to the borrower that the lender would not otherwise consider, relating to the borrower's financial difficulties (forbearance);\n- -A growing likelihood that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial restructuring;\n- -The disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial market difficulties;\n- -The purchase or origination of a financial asset at a deep discount that reflects the incurred credit loss.",

        "page_content": "It may not always be possible to identify a single discrete event; instead the combined effect of several events may have caused financial assets to become impaired. All impaired assets are also classified as defaulted by Van Lanschot Kempen under CRR rules. Van Lanschot Kempen has implemented one definition that serves for all its different purposes.\n\n## 3.2 Forborne exposures\n\nA loan is considered forborne if the borrower is unable to meet their contractual obligations towards the bank and the bank decides to make a concession to the client by modifying the terms and conditions of the loan agreement. The objective of this modification is to enable the borrower to meet the renewed obligations, and it would not have been offered if those circumstances had not arisen. Forbearance actions may include one or more of the following measures:\n\n- -Amendment of the original terms and conditions of the loan agreement that the client cannot meet due to financial difficulties, with a view to restoring the client's payment capacity;\n- -Full or partial refinancing of a forborne exposure.\n\nThe purpose of the measures taken in forbearance situations is to maximise the chance of restoring the borrower's payment capacity and to minimise the risk of losses due to having to write off all or part of the loan. Measures must offer the client an appropriate and sustainable solution, enabling them to comply with the original obligations arising from the credit agreement in due course.\n\nApplying forbearance measures is exclusively reserved for the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team, which pursues a policy based on general principles and translates this to the specific situation of the individual client. Given the nature of these loans, the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team carries out intensive credit management. Before any new arrangements are agreed, a detailed analysis is made of the client, their financial situation and the likelihood of income recovery. The outcome of this analysis may have consequences for the client's review frequency and the size of any loan loss provision to be made. If the client qualifies for appropriate forbearance measures, a proposal will be drawn up and submitted to the competent assessor(s) for approval. If a forbearance measure is granted, the client is classified as a non-performing exposure.\n\nIn practice, forbearance measures do not always have the desired effect - i.e. the recovery of the client's payment capacity or an end to the process of declining payment capacity. This may, for example, be the result of a further deterioration in the client's financial circumstances or the failure of those circumstances to improve as expected. Such cases are reanalysed and a strategy is redefined. However, the principle is explicitly maintained that the forbearance measure must be appropriate, sustainable and effective. Any new arrangements agreed with the borrower must also meet these strict criteria.\n\nA forbearance situation ends when the non-performing status has no longer been applied to the loan for a probation period of two years. The non-performing status must last a minimum of one year starting from the last forbearance measure. Moreover, the client must have made significant and regular payments of interest and/or principal during at least half of the probation period. During the two-year probation period, no payments by the borrower may be in arrears for more than 30 days. If this condition is not met, the probation period will start again from the date the client is no longer in arrears for more than 30 days.\n\nThe recording and monitoring of loans which are subject to forbearance is carried out by the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team. Each quarter, and where appropriate more frequently for specific loans, an individual assessment is carried out of forborne exposures which are in default, in relation to any provision made. In addition to this quarterly assessment (as part of the provisioning process), these loans are subject to extensive credit risk management, the intensity and frequency of which will as far as possible match the specific circumstances of the loan.\n\nFollowing the decision to apply such a measure, a loan remains under the supervision of the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team until the forbearance situation has ended.\n\nTables 3.2.A through 3.2.C show the total volume of forborne exposures. We apply several types of forbearance measures (see Table 3.2.A).\n\n| Table 3.2.A Types of forborne exposure            | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total                                             | 26,210       | 27,667       |\n| Capitalisation of arrears/interest                | -            | 430          |\n| Refinancing or new loans                          | 1,881        | 2,954        |\n| Interest payment only                             | -            | 488          |\n| Reduction of repayments                           | 7,619        | 9,320        |\n| Deferred payment of financing costs               | 741          | 417          |\n| Extension of loan term                            | 2,548        | 11,593       |\n| Reduction in interest rate                        | 3,747        | 2,466        |\n| Sale by agreement/assisted sale                   | 1,041        | -            |\n| Other alteration of contract conditions/covenants | 8,364        | -            |\n| Partial or total debt forgiveness                 | 268          | -            |",

        "page_content": "## 3.8.1 Expected loss measurement\n\nWe measure expected credit losses by using a sophisticated approach and an alternative approach. For the sophisticated approach we use models to calculate the ECL, governed by a model governance framework. Under this framework, the performance of the models is periodically monitored, and these models are also periodically validated. In 2023, the following IFRS 9 models were validated: exposure at default (EAD) model, loss given no cure (LGN) model and the macro economic variables (MEV) generator. Every quarter, the models are subject to performance monitoring. If models are performing outside the agreed threshold, recalibration or ultimately redevelopment will follow. In recent years, several recalibrations have been carried out; no redevelopment has yet been necessary.\n\nIn both approaches, ECL reflects an unbiased probabilityweighted amount that is determined by evaluating a range of possible outcomes, the time value of money, and reasonable and verifiable information that is available without undue cost or effort at the reporting date about past events, current conditions and forecasts of future economic conditions. Both approaches calculate a 12-month and a lifetime ECL for the exposures of all three stages.\n\nAfter the risk stage determination in the stage calculation, the relevant ECL is assigned:\n\n- -12-month ECL for Stage 1;\n- -Lifetime ECL for Stage 2 and Stage 3.\n\n| Model          | Macroeconomic variables                                                                      |\n|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| PD calibration | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Volume of exports (EXP)                                     |\n| Cure rate      | - Residential real estate price (RREP) - Volume of exports (EXP)                             |\n| LGN            | - Gross domestic product (GDP) - Residential real estate price (RREP) - Unemployment (UNEMP) |\n| EAD            | n/a                                                                                          |\n\n## 3.8.2 Significant deterioration in credit risk\n\nTo determine the deterioration in credit risk of a financial instrument since initial recognition, we compare the risk of default at the reporting date with the risk of default on initial recognition.\n\nTo calculate the lifetime probability of default (LPD) at origination and the LPD at reporting date, we use four PD models: private individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporates, and commercial real estate. If the increase in LPD exceeds the designated threshold, the exposure is transferred to Stage 2 and the lifetime ECL is calculated.\n\nThe key elements of the ECL calculation are the probability of default (PD), exposure at default (EAD), cure rate (CR), and loss given non-cure (LGN). LGN is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default without cure occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral.\n\nIn addition to these four key elements, we incorporate forward-looking information for the sophisticated approach.\n\nWe identify macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL:\n\n- -A base-case scenario;\n- -An upside scenario;\n- -A downside scenario.\n\nThese scenarios are associated with different PDs, EADs and LGNs. In the process of building the PD, cure rate and LGN models for IFRS, we included several macroeconomic risk drivers in the long list of risk drivers. Those determined as best-performing during modelling were selected to be part of the model. The macroeconomic scenarios are generated based on inputs from CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis, DNB, ECB and Van Lanschot Kempen's economic experts. The reported ECL (12-month or lifetime, depending on the stage) is a weighted ECL average per macroeconomic scenario. The table below shows the macroeconomic variables used for the sophisticated approach. However, we believe our models do not fully incorporate the unique current economic environment. To address the uncertain economic environment, we have applied a management overlay (see Section 3.8.7).\n\nA backstop is applied and financial instruments that are materially overdrawn and more than 30 days past due are transferred from Stage 1 to Stage 2. If the financial instrument is credit-impaired, it is transferred to Stage 3.",

This approach uses an umbrella model that combines the following sub-models:\n\n- -Various models that provide the expected flow of exposures to the default state;\n- -A PD calibration model giving the flow from performing to default;\n- -A full prepayment model and amortisation model giving the outflow from the portfolio of an entire exposure due to prepayment or contract expiration;\n- -A migration model providing flows from performing rating classes to other performing rating classes;\n- -A cure rate model giving the flow from default to performing classes and the non-cure state;\n\n-\n\nVarious product-level models that give the expected\n\nexposure at the moment a client goes into default;\n\n- -An amortisation model showing the contractual payments during the lifetime of a product and the part of the exposure flowing out of the portfolio due to partial prepayments;\n- -An EAD model giving the exposure as a function of the limit or outstanding amount just before default;\n- -A product-level model evaluating the part of EAD that may be lost - the loss given loss (LGL) model;\n- -A discount factor to discount the loss from the moment of default to the moment of reporting.\n\n## 3.8.4 Financial instruments following the alternative approach\n\nWe apply an alternative approach for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income, and loans and securities-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and Van Lanschot Kempen (Schweiz) AG. The alternative approach comprises an investments model and a foreign loan model.\n\n## 3.8.5 Investments model\n\nThe investments model is applied to calculate the ECL for cash and cash equivalents, due from banks, debt instruments at amortised cost, and debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income. These financial instruments all have a low risk profile. All such exposures are assigned to Stage 1 as long as their external rating is investment grade. We use a simplified model to calculate 12-month ECL, using publicly available data for PD and LGD based on external ratings. If financial assets are downgraded below investment grade, these assets will be sold.\n\n## 3.8.6 Foreign loans model\n\nFor the loans and securities-backed loans issued by the Belgian branch and Van Lanschot Kempen (Schweiz) AG, we have developed a foreign loans model. These two portfolios fall outside the scope of the A-IRB models and no requirements on historical data have been set. The foreign loans model calculates ECL as the sum of future exposure discounted at the effective interest rate at recognition for non-revolving products and the current effective interest rate for revolving products. In 2023, we recalibrated the Belgian foreign loan sub-model.\n\n## 3.8.7 Management overlay\n\nThe continued economic uncertainty, further exacerbated by geopolitical unrest, is, in our view, still not fully captured by the IFRS 9 models, and so we have kept our general management overlay in place. Our models are based on observable data (days past due on loans, number of loans in default, etc.), which do not show signs of stress. Neither do external data such as provisions for other Dutch banks which have clients with lower financial buffers on average nor  Dutch unemployment rates indicate economic headwinds. As a result, we consider our models to be correct given that these are bound by observable data - resulting in the need for an overlay. This overlay applies to all loan portfolios and exposures included in the scope of our sophisticated approach IFRS 9 framework. It focuses on PDspecific adjustments, since we believe a more general overlay will materialise mostly in the probability of client default. The overlay consists of two adjustments. First, one of the PD model risk drivers, the amount of arrears, has changed from 12-month moving average to point-in-time to reflect recent arrears behaviour. Second, it is reasonable to assume that discretionary income could be impacted and result in increased arrears. Also, borrowers subject to an interest rate reset could face significantly higher financing costs. Based on expert judgement, we shocked the PD for the entire portfolio. In addition, we have made an adjustment to the methodology for determining the weights of the economic scenarios. Until 2023, this was part of the management overlay. From the end of 2023, we incorporated this into our regular IFRS 9 models, thereby removing it from the management overlay. The weights of the economic scenarios are determined every quarter by our Investment Strategy Research department.\n\nThe management overlay resulted in a provision of \u20ac3.4 million (2022: \u20ac5.2 million). A lower management overlay is logical in light of the recent more positive information for the economy, which has reduced the chances of a severe recession. Even after incorporating this overlay, the net impact on our credit portfolio was relatively limited. This is reflected in the relatively small increase in ECL.\n\n## 3.8.8 Loss allowances\n\nThe table below shows the ECL loss allowances and the corresponding book values (including revocable and irrevocable commitments), categorised by balance sheet line item and ECL by stage.",

However, the main driver was the adjustment of the model for Belgian Lombard loans. The coverage ratio remained stable.\n\n## Stage 2\n\nStage 2 provisions went down from \u20ac7.0 million to \u20ac6.1 million in 2023, with the Stage 2 exposure adding \u20ac73 million. The decrease in provisions was mainly caused by the release of the management overlay in Stage 2. The coverage ratio decreased slightly compared with 2022.\n\n## Stage 3\n\nThe baseline for Stage 3 provisions is determined by the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team, with limited IFRS 9 model adjustments. In 2023, Stage 3 provisions rose slightly to \u20ac27.7 million. This was due to a release of provisions on the resolution of some specific impaired exposures and writeoffs, offset by increased provisioning on existing impaired loans and new defaults. The total impaired exposure advanced to \u20ac126 million, while the coverage ratio decreased slightly compared with 2022.\n\nLoss allowances for ECL change over time for several reasons: the credit risk of financial instruments may significantly increase or decrease, financial instruments may become credit-impaired, or new financial assets may be purchased. The following tables explain the changes in the loss allowances during the year and the loss allowance recognised in the statement of income.",

Credit risk grades are defined\n\nusing qualitative (applying experienced credit judgement) and quantitative factors that are indicative of risk of default. These factors vary depending on the nature of the exposure and the type of borrower.\n\nWe use internally developed rating pools for the line items Loans and advances to the public and private sectors and Financial guarantees and loan commitments.\n\n| Credit grade        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |\n|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Investment grade    | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are not placed under the supervision of the Financial Restructuring &  Recovery team, internal rating pool 1       |\n| Standard monitoring | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are not placed under the supervision of the Financial Restructuring &  Recovery team, internal rating pools 2 to 4 |\n| Special monitoring  | Non-credit-impaired financial assets that are placed under the supervision of the Financial Restructuring &  Recovery team                                   |\n| Default             | Credit-impaired financial assets                                                                                                                             |\n\nAll financial instruments under the line items Cash and cash equivalents, Due from banks, Debt instruments at amortised cost and Debt instruments at fair value through other comprehensive income are investment grade, which means their external rating is at least BBB-. We use external ratings for these line items.\n\nThe credit quality of the line items Loans and advances to the public and private sectors and Financial guarantees and loan commitments is shown in the tables below. Assessment of credit quality is based on our internal credit rating system and year-end stage classification. The amounts presented are gross of impairment allowances.",

We use macroeconomic variables and consider three macroeconomic scenarios in calculating ECL: a base-case scenario, an upside scenario, and a downside scenario. The weightings of the scenarios were 10% for the upside scenario, 40% for the downside scenario and 50% for the base-case scenario as at 31 December 2022.\n\nIn 2023, we made an adjustment to the methodology for determining the weights of the economic scenarios. The dynamic weighting of macroeconomic scenarios was part of the management overlay, but is now included in the regular IFRS 9 models. At the end of 2023, the weightings were 10% for the upside scenario, 20% for the downside scenario and 70% for the base-case scenario.",

The total carrying amount of creditimpaired financial instruments for which there is no impairment recognised is \u20ac31.7 million (2022: \u20ac41.1 million).\n\n## 4. Market risk\n\nMarket risk is the risk of loss as a result of changes in market variables, including interest rates, exchange rates and share prices. Other variables not directly observable in the market, such as volatility, long-term dividend expectations and correlations, can also influence the value of financial instruments. The market risk to which we are exposed can be divided into three components. Firstly, the market risk to which Van Lanschot Kempen Treasury is exposed in respect of its structured products activities (part of the Other activities operating segment) and services to clients. Secondly, market risk stemming from trading activities in institutional securities, which is concentrated in the Investment Banking Clients operating segment. Lastly, exposure to market risks is also generated by investments in Van Lanschot Kempen's management book of \u20ac79.1 million (2022: \u20ac118.8 million). These investments provide seed capital for newly launched Van Lanschot Kempen funds and allow us to co-invest with our clients.\n\n## 4.1 Trading activities in securities\n\nOur trading activities in securities mainly comprise equities, equity derivatives and interest rate derivatives. Equities are concentrated in the Investment Banking Clients operating segment (equity brokerage) while equity derivatives and interest rate derivatives are concentrated in Van Lanschot Kempen Treasury (structured products activities). In response to the higher interest rate environment, we have seen a shift among our clients from complex equity structured notes to simpler structured notes.\n\nA governance structure has been created to facilitate effective risk management. This is based on the three lines of defence model, where the first line has direct insights in the live risk exposures and is responsible for staying within the set limits, the second line monitors daily to ensure that limits are respected, and Internal Audit performs periodic audits on the policies and procedures set by Risk Management and evaluates effectiveness and completeness. The risks are managed using value at risk (VaR) limits as well as gross and net limits. Daily stress tests provide information about changes in portfolio values in extreme market conditions and complement the VaR calculation.\n\nThe VaR for the trading portfolios is computed daily, based on a one-day time horizon with a 97.5% confidence level on one year of historical data.\n\nOther risks relating to derivatives, such as stock market changes and volatility, and interest rate changes (delta, vega and rho respectively) are embedded in our structured notes. These risks are separately monitored on a daily basis or more frequently if necessary.\n\nSeparate limits are in place for all risk drivers. VaR and other relevant risk parameters are reported to senior management (including two Management Board members) on a daily basis. The embedded derivatives sold to our clients are hedged by Van Lanschot Kempen. The majority of the complex market risks (exotic risks) are hedged on a back-to-back basis. The non-exotic risks and limited exotic risks due to secondary market trading are hedged via the macro-hedging strategy. This means that the complex derivatives sold to clients are broken down into individual risk drivers (i.e. delta exposure on S&P500 or Euro Stoxx 50). The total macro exposure per risk driver is calculated and this is hedged by using relatively simple (mostly listed) options. All risk drivers have limits both on an individual as well as on an aggregate level and we monitor them daily and/or intra-day. This highly granular view of limits results in limited basis risks.\n\n| Table 4.1 Trading activities VaR   | 2023                | 2023          | 2022                | 2022          |\n|------------------------------------|---------------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|\n|                                    | Derivatives-related | Share-related | Derivatives-related | Share-related |\n| At 31 December                     | 32                  | 70            | 82                  | 118           |\n| Highest VaR                        | 275                 | 288           | 280                 | 311           |\n| Lowest VaR                         | 9                   | 39            | 42                  | 66            |\n| Average VaR                        | 114                 | 157           | 152                 | 156           |\n\n## 4.2 Market risk due to foreign exchange positions\n\nTo a limited degree, treasury activities (mainly foreign exchange exposure, comprising client transactions and own positions) result in positions exposed to market risks. The Treasury department is part of the Other activities operating segment. The majority of transactions and positions in the statement of financial position are denominated in euros. Exchange rate risk is managed within the required limits and an authorisation structure applies.\n\nForeign exchange positions are shown in Table 4.2.B and include all cash, forward and option positions of the entities in scope of consolidation.",

This amounts to 7% of the net open positions in each currency (2022: 5%). Under the Basel IV rule set, which will take effect as of 2025, our capital requirements for exchange rate risk amounted to \u20ac0.3 million at year-end 2023 (2022: \u20ac0.3 million).\n\nCredit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) is the risk of volatility in earnings and/or equity, caused by spread movements of the yield on banking book instruments that are classified at fair value, versus the swap curve.\n\nFor Van Lanschot Kempen, CSRBB is mainly concentrated in the investment and liquidity portfolios. CSRBB limits have been imposed on these portfolios, which are monitored by ALCO on a monthly basis.\n\n## 4.3 Market risk capitalisation\n\nWe use the maturity method to calculate the capital adequacy requirement in respect of the general risk on debt instruments in the trading portfolio. Share-related instruments are share instruments included under Financial assets from trading activities (see Table 4.3).\n\n| Table 4.3 Market risk        | 31/12/2023     | 31/12/2023                    | 31/12/2022     | 31/12/2022                    |\n|------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|\n|                              | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement | Risk weighting | Capital adequacy  requirement |\n| Total                        | 170,930        | 13,674                        | 203,308        | 16,265                        |\n| Interest-related instruments | 120,287        | 9,623                         | 155,210        | 12,417                        |\n| Share-related instruments    | 49,943         | 3,995                         | 46,756         | 3,741                         |\n| Currency-related instruments | 700            | 56                            | 1,342          | 107                           |\n\n## Weighting and requirements\n\nWe use the standardised approach for all types of market risk. The market risk of interest rate derivatives is included under Interest-related instruments; the market risk of sharerelated derivatives is included under Share-related instruments; and the market risk of currency derivatives is included under Currency-related instruments.",

        "page_content": "## 5. Settlement risk\n\nWe are required to hold capital for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline, if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss. Settlement risk is monitored and managed on a daily basis.\n\nAt year-end 2023, financial transactions totalling \u20ac9.1 million (2022: \u20ac11.0 million) had to be reported in the context of settlement risk.\n\n## 6. CVA risk\n\nUnder the CRR, account must also be taken of the riskweighted assets in relation to CVA, which must be adequate to cover the risk of a deterioration in the creditworthiness of the counterparty in a derivatives transaction (bilateral or centrally cleared). This CVA capital adequacy requirement is additional to requirements applying to the risk-weighted assets in relation to the 'regular' default risk of a counterparty. We use the standardised method to calculate the capital requirement for CVA.\n\n## 7. Interest rate risk\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) is the exposure to adverse market interest rate movements, arising from banking book activities. Adverse interest rate movements may impact a bank's current and/or future earnings, capital and market value. Responsibility for IRRBB management has been delegated by the Management Board to ALCO.\n\nInterest rate risks in non-banking book items are managed as part of market risk.\n\nOur main source of interest rate risk is the maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. In general, assets have longer interest rate maturities than liabilities, contractually as well as behaviourally. We model client behaviour with respect to the prepayment patterns of mortgages and loans and the interest rate risk profiles of savings and current accounts. When modelling this, model risk arises because actually observed client behaviour may deviate from assumptions. Differences between assumed and actually observed client behaviour could have a material adverse impact on future results.\n\nWe manage interest rate risk from both a long- and a shortterm perspective. The short-term interest rate risk is addressed mainly from a net interest income perspective (delta net interest income, or \u0394 NII). This involves an analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\nIn 2023, all \u0394 NII scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2023, the most adverse scenario was a scenario in which short term interest rates come down again. The \u0394 NII for this scenario was -6.6% at the end of 2023 (end of 2022: -4.5%, in a scenario in which interest rates would flatten). Table 7.A shows the interest rate risk metrics.\n\n| Table 7.A Interest rate risk metrics    | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Delta net interest income ( \u0394 NII)      | -6.6 %       | -4.5 %       |\n| Delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE) | -5.3 %       | -8.4 %       |\n\nWe address long-term interest rate risk by means of the economic value approach, which looks at how movements in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities. The rule-of-thumb metric for economic value analysis is duration of equity, which indicates the net impact of parallel interest rate changes on economic value, assuming a linear relationship between these parameters.\n\nAlthough we use duration of equity as a rule of thumb for economic value sensitivity, we also calculate economic value changes under various scenarios. In doing so, all interest rate cash flows are replotted and revalued at shocked interest rate curves and we use coupon rates that are stripped from margins. In 2023, all delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE) scenarios remained within risk appetite limits. By year-end 2023, the most adverse scenario was an instant upwards shock of 200 basis points. The \u0394 EVE for this scenario was -5.3% at the end of 2023 (end of 2022: -8.4%).\n\nWe aim to neutralise the impact of differences in accounting classifications on interest rate steering. Hence, we mostly hedge the interest rate risk in fair value through profit or loss items in the banking book on a back-to-back basis, by means of interest rate swaps. By doing so, we make sure that Result on financial transactions - to the extent that it arises from banking book items - is only impacted by market changes in credit spreads over the swap curve and that there is no net impact from changes in the swap curve itself. For this reason, the \u0394 NII scenarios we use to assess our interest rate risk profile do not affect the Result on financial transactions.\n\nWe use hedge accounting to offset changes in the market value of derivatives that are used for hedging portfolios classified at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income .",

Liquidity risk\n\nThe main objective of our liquidity risk management is to ensure that we are able to maintain or generate sufficient cash resources to meet our payment obligations in full as they come due, on acceptable terms. One of the key elements of our approach towards liquidity risk management is to maintain stakeholder confidence in the bank's solidity at all times.\n\nThe main source of liquidity risk that we are exposed to relates to the share of client deposits in our funding base. Although client deposits have proven to be relatively priceinelastic and sticky over time, the withdrawable nature of such deposits poses potential outflow risks, especially for those deposits not covered by the deposit guarantee scheme (DGS).\n\nThe roll-over risk with respect to maturing capital market funding is less substantial for us, since our client deposit base comfortably funds our entire loan book. To still obtain a certain degree of diversification in our funding mix, we have covered bond programmes in place.\n\nTo manage liquidity risks, we use a forward-looking liquidity risk management framework that enables the comprehensive measurement, evaluation and calibration of indicators related to liquidity risk. The framework consists of the risk appetite statement, the liquidity buffer, monitoring and reporting, forecasting, funding planning and contingency planning.\n\nLimits for liquidity risk are revised on an annual basis as part of the risk appetite limit structure. Limits set include, but are not limited to, levels of the liquidity coverage ratio, the net stable funding ratio and stress test survival periods, which are reported to ALCO on a monthly basis. In addition to the regular monthly liquidity reporting, the liquidity buffer and client deposit flows are monitored in the weekly liquidity report. This report includes metrics that have been identified as early warning indicators for possible liquidity stress. The liquidity buffer is the main defensive element against liquidity risk, and the quality and size of the buffer are monitored frequently, along with inflows and outflows in the client deposit base.\n\nFinally, each year we outline our capital and funding planning for a three-year horizon, both under regular circumstances in the capital and funding plan, and under potential future stress or emergency situations in the liquidity contingency plan, complemented by the recovery plan.\n\nPart of our liquidity and funding planning is scenario analysis, of which stress testing is a key element. By means of stress testing, we assess our resilience to a variety of adverse liquidity events - Van Lanschot Kempen-specific events, system-wide events, and a combination of these two.",

Securitisation risk\n\nWe treat securitisation as an asset class in our investment portfolio. We are not party to any synthetic securitisations and have no trading position in securitisation transactions.\n\n## Funding\n\nWe do not structure securitisations for other entities and have no outstanding securitisation transactions in which we act as a sponsor, seller and/or servicer.\n\n## Investments\n\nPart of our liquidity investment portfolio is invested in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS). We invest only in the most senior and AAA-rated RMBS tranches. If they comply with the simple, transparent and standardised (STS) requirements, these securitisations qualify as high-quality liquid assets. All our RMBS investments are ECB eligible, meaning that they have at least two ratings from an external credit assessment institution (ECAI).\n\nAs the investments are part of the liquidity buffer, they can be used as collateral, in repo transactions, or sold if necessary. The holdings in RMBS represent a minor share of the total investment portfolio.\n\n## Risk exposures within the investment portfolio\n\nThe credit risks of the investments are not hedged. Our investment portfolio as a whole is monitored by the Treasury department and the Credit Approval team on a daily basis. The portfolio is monitored on nominal limits as well as on credit risk limits.\n\n## Management\n\nInterest rate risk is limited, as RMBS are typically floatingrate notes. Interest rate risk is monitored at balance sheet level and includes the investment portfolio. We use the SECERBA methodology to calculate the total risk exposure of RMBS investments.",

        "page_content": "## 10. Climate change and sustainability risks\n\nSustainability risks relate to environmental, social and governance (ESG) themes. As these are relatively new types of risk, we are still developing policies and frameworks, and are collecting data to manage them. Currently, the most measurable ESG risks are climate-related, and these are discussed in more detail in this section. Climate change risk reflects the physical and/or transitional impacts of a change in the climate on Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position and/or reputation. Based on the factors as discussed below, we conclude that no impairments as a result of sustainability risks are necessary. However, sustainability risks could very well lead to a combination of financial, reputational and legal problems in the long term if not addressed proactively. Our approach to managing climate risks includes aligning our organisation with the ECB's expectations as set out in its\n\nguidance on climate-related and environmental risks. The risk to our activities posed by climate change is periodically assessed.\n\nClimate change risks are addressed and managed via our sustainability risk policy. This policy assures that risks are assessed from an integrated/holistic perspective, taking all risk drivers and activities into account. Starting from 2023, we have made significant improvements by putting a formal framework in place (part of this sustainability risk policy) to both identify potential climate risks and to assess the materiality of these risks. This has resulted in increased granularity of our risk analyses to provide further insight into our risk profile, as reflected in the table below. Sustainability risks have an effect on our on- and off-balance sheet activities.\n\n| Table 10 Balance sheet based on sustainability criteria  (\u20ac million)   | Table 10 Balance sheet based on sustainability criteria  (\u20ac million)   | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2022   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| 1                                                                      | Cash at central banks                                                  | 2,820        | 3,049        |\n| 2                                                                      | Sovereign, semi-sovereign, supranational and agency bonds              | 1,584        | 1,224        |\n| 3                                                                      | Covered bonds and RMBS                                                 | 1,941        | 1,737        |\n| 4                                                                      | Corporate bonds                                                        | -            | 33           |\n| 5                                                                      | Residential mortgages                                                  | 7,018        | 7,033        |\n| 6                                                                      | Family business & entrepreneurs                                        | 594          | 871          |\n| 7                                                                      | Lombard loans                                                          | 724          | 738          |\n| 8                                                                      | Real estate loans                                                      | 325          | 353          |\n| 9                                                                      | Other loans                                                            | 500          | 368          |\n| 10                                                                     | Van Lanschot Kempen's management book                                  | 79           | 119          |\n| 11                                                                     | Equity trading activities                                              | 13           | 17           |\n| 12                                                                     | Structured product activities                                          | 37           | 49           |\n| 13                                                                     | Other items                                                            | 1,200        | 1,427        |\n|                                                                        | Total assets                                                           | 16,836       | 17,018       |\n\n## On-balance sheet activities\n\n- 1. We believe that the sustainability risks of our central bank exposures are limited. Our main exposure is via DNB. DNB has exposure to national commercial banks via their investments in relatively safe assets and is backed by a sovereign entity. The risks run by DNB and the Eurosystem at large are mitigated by the fact that the Eurosystem can correct unacceptable risks by changing supervisory rules. Moreover, DNB, as a monetary authority, is able to accept temporarily negative equity positions, so even large losses arising from a sustainability risk event can be absorbed.\n- 2. Our (semi-)sovereign, supranational and agency debt holdings are mainly from issuers in the European Union, Canada and Belgium. Their debt has a minimum credit rating of AA-, making these issuers capable of withstanding major costs as a result of physical or transitional risks. Also, by signing the Paris Agreement, these issuers' countries have committed to build resilience against the consequences of climate change - e.g. rising sea levels thereby reducing local physical climate risks.\n- 3. Our covered bonds and RMBS holdings are all rated AAA. The majority of the financial assets backed by mortgages are located in the Netherlands and France. Currently, no loan level data is available to calculate the specific ESG risks on these positions. For our RMBS instruments - where we have direct exposure to the underlying pool of mortgages some general analytics are available. The geographical\n\ndistribution of the mortgage pools does not materially differ from the total issuers mortgage pool, thereby reducing the physical risks. Moreover, there is a substantial credit enhancement present in the RMBS transactions, which ranges from 4.0% to 55.2%, and the average LTVs range from 44.3% to 75.6%. The RMBS instruments in the lower range of the credit enhancement are also in the lower range of LTVs. Covered bonds give additional protection through dual recourse, as the underlying mortgage pool will only be resorted to if the issuing bank defaults. What's more, the mortgage pool is continuously monitored and, if needed, adapted to meet the criteria of the asset cover test. Physical concentration is also taken into account. In our opinion the mortgage-backed financial assets we have invested in are thus capable of withstanding costs arising from physical or transitional risks.\n\n- 4. Corporate bonds are potentially significantly prone to climate risks when the issuing corporation is heavily impacted by changes in climate and policies (for example fossil fuel companies). Currently we do not hold any corporate bonds.\n- 5. Residential mortgages represent our most concentrated position in terms of (potential) sustainability risks. Given the geographical characteristics of the Netherlands, we are mainly exposed to physical risks related to fluvial and pluvial flooding and the effect of drought on the stability of",

        "page_content": "building foundations (pole rot and changes in surface level). Regarding fluvial and pluvial flooding, we combine highly detailed data on flooding risk in the Netherlands (probability of flood and, if a flood event takes place, the distribution of potential water levels) and specific characteristics of the collateral (house/apartment) to quantify the potential impact on collateral valuations. Based on internally defined flooding scenarios we determine our exposure to flooding risk. The limited average LTV increase as a result of flood damage, given the low probability of such an event, implies that actual projected losses are expected to be manageable. At the same time, given our solid capital position, a temporary increase in regulatory capital (as a result of lower collateral valuations after a flood, which directly impact capital under IRB) is also manageable. We have also carried out a similar analysis on the effect of drought on the stability of building foundations, again using highly detailed data on the risk of pole rot and changes in building surfaces to calculate potential economic risk as well as the effect on our capital. Given the limited number of houses on timber supports and the limited impact in terms of changes in foundation stability, these factors are seen as manageable.\n\nOur residential mortgage portfolio is also prone to transitional risks which could impact the value of the collateral in future due to rising energy prices and/or renovation costs to meet future legislation on energy efficiency/emissions. Using the characteristics of the collateral (building year, size, current energy label, etc.), we determined the renovation costs needed to improve the energy efficiency of the collateral.We then deducted these renovation costs from the current market value of the collateral to derive a stressed market value as a result of transition risk (we assume non-renovated collateral will be worth less in the future). Given the limited renovation costs, our low average LTV and the on average significant assets of our clients, the transition risks are limited and nonmaterial. In addition, the IFRS provision for defaulted mortgages (IFRS 9, Stage 3) is determined per individual credit file by the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team. If there are significant climate risks relating to defaulted loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined.\n\n- 6. Family business & entrepreneurial loans mostly comprise niche lending to health care specialists and to business professionals such as main audit and law firm partners. These business professionals have limited direct exposure to climate and environmental risks. The same holds for healthcare specialists, such a pharmacists, general practitioners and veterinarians. Based on the limited exposures and non-impacted sectors, the sustainability risks are limited and non-material. If loans are in default, the IFRS provision for Stage 3 is determined per individual credit file by the Financial Restructuring & Recovery team. If there are significant climate risks relating to our Stage 3 loans, those risks are taken into consideration when the IFRS 9 provision is determined.\n- 7. For our Lombard loans, there are several general risk protection features in place to limit credit losses. We only allow loans up to 70% of the pledged investment portfolio and apply a client-specific limit based on their financial situation. When the 70% threshold is reached, securities will be automatically sold to lower the loan amount and thereby the risk level. In addition, the underlying\n\n- investment portfolio must be well diversified in order to limit downside risk. The probability that a climate-related event will have such a severe impact on a well-diversified client portfolio that the LTV increases above 100% is deemed very limited.\n- 8. Our real estate loans comprise both residential and commercial properties and are quite limited in size, at \u20ac342 million. Van Lanschot Kempen's exposure to commercial mortgages is limited, due to the run-off of our corporate banking activities. Lending policies regarding office buildings and rental properties have been updated to reflect more stringent rules on the energy efficiency of the collateral. For office buildings, a minimum energy label C is required from 2023 onwards and for residential rental properties, a minimum label of D is required for new loans. Given the limited exposure, we conclude that there is no material climate risk to our real estate loan portfolio.\n- 9. Other loans mostly consists of current account assets and the remainder of the corporate banking loans. Given the generally short-term nature of the current account assets and limited size and nature of our corporate banking loans, the climate risk is deemed immaterial.\n- 10. Van Lanschot Kempen's investments include our coinvestments in Van Lanschot Kempen investment funds via our own management book, amounting to a total position of \u20ac79.1 million, which we invest in accordance with our sustainable investment policies. For the positions in our management book we assess sustainability risks via three defined stress scenarios. Losses resulting from this stress test are limited and well within our current trading limits. We deem these risks to be immaterial.\n- 11. Equity brokerage is aimed at agency trading with the purpose of client facilitation. In the process of facilitating trades for clients, residual equity positions can be (temporarily) held on our own accounts. If these positions become too large, they will be hedged with financial instruments such as derivatives. Given the nature of the trading book (short holding positions, daily position management), we have limited exposure to climate risks. For the equity positions in our trading book, we assess sustainability risks via three defined stress scenarios. Losses resulting from this stress test are limited and well within our current trading limits. We thus deem these risks to be immaterial.\n- 12. The Structured Products activities revolve around issuing medium-term notes (mostly Van Lanschot Kempen notes) combined with a derivative. In most cases, this derivative is associated with a well-diversified equity index (for example the EuroStoxx50 or the S&P 500 index), and this generally results in less exposure to climate risk than more concentrated equity positions in specific single stocks. Additionally, nearly all market risk present at the Structured Products desk is hedged (largely back-to-back), resulting in very limited exposures to climate risks that can materialise through financial market movements. We conclude that these risks do not pose a material risk.\n- 13. Other items comprise various relatively small items, with no large concentrations, and hence no material risk.",

On both a quantitative and qualitative basis, Risk Management measures and analyses the sustainability risks related to our investment management activities. All sustainability-related policy for our assets under management (AuM) are defined by the Sustainability Investment Council and approved by the Sustainability Board.\n\n## Compliance, legal and operational risks associated with climate change and sustainability risks\n\nFor our own organisation, physical climate risks are defined as the risk of flooding, drought and other natural hazards that could put the regular execution of our operations at risk. This type of risk is included in our business continuity stresstesting methodology among several scenarios that could lead to a prolonged disruption of facility usage. From a transition climate risk perspective, the most prominent risk for our organisation is the risk of non-compliance with changes in regulatory requirements, which could result in regulatory fines or lawsuits due to sustainability misrepresentation (\"greenwashing\"). The mitigation of this risk is implemented through our three lines of defence approach.\n\n## 11. Operational risk\n\nOperational risks are potential losses that result from inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, inadequate or incorrect human actions, external events and fraud. Operational risk also includes cybercrime & information security risk, which is defined as the risk that the confidentiality, integrity and/or availability of Van Lanschot Kempen's information assets is compromised by internal failure of IT equipment, resulting in financial or reputational damage, and/or regulatory sanctions. Within Van Lanschot Kempen, operational losses are classified using operational loss event types as set out in the Basel framework.\n\nWe have created a range of instruments for identifying, evaluating, monitoring and managing operational risks to support the bank's management in their roles as risk owners.\n\n- -Operational risk appetite: This appetite defines the level of - quantitative and qualitative - operational risk we are willing to accept. Exceeding this appetite requires the attention of the Management Board and will lead to additional mitigation measures as and when necessary.\n- -Risk identification and assessment via risk and control self-assessments and scenario analysis:\n- -Risk and control self-assessment is a tool that allows line managers to systematically identify and assess risks so that steps can be taken to manage any risks outside the risk appetite. Risk and control selfassessments are carried out, at tactical (department) level, on the most important value chains of the organisation and on our most important programmes and projects. These assessments are re-performed periodically in order to reassess and update the existing operational risk level.\n- -Scenario analyses are used to assess low frequency but high-impact risks. The results of these analyses are used to provide insight into the adequacy of the Pillar 1 capital requirement vis-\u00e0-vis the operational risk profile.\n\n- -Risk response: Management is responsible for deciding how to treat risk, and whether to mitigate, accept or transfer (insure) it:\n- -Action tracking: Action tracking is used to track progress made in the delivery of actions to mitigate identified risks, arising from risk and control selfassessments, failing controls, analysis of incidents or complaints, findings by Internal Audit and external regulators, and other relevant events.\n- -Control effectiveness monitoring: To ensure that the most important risks (key risks) are mitigated sufficiently, key controls have been defined; these are assessed on a regular basis to determine their effectiveness.\n- -Risk insurance: To protect the organisation against major operational risk-related losses, we have taken out insurance policies that cover claims and losses resulting from the services offered. Broadly speaking, these policies are a combination of fraud and professional liability insurance, directors' liability insurance and various other liability and accident insurance policies.\n- -Risk acceptance: If a risk is assessed to be outside of the risk appetite and it is not possible or economically viable to lower the risk, the risk can be accepted at Management Board level.\n\n## -Risk monitoring:\n\n- -Incident management: Risks that materialise through an incident are registered in our incidents database via the incident management process. For severe incidents, root cause analyses are carried out. The incidents database allows the systematic recording and analysis of losses resulting from operational risks. It contains information about losses incurred as a result of operational risks in prior years and the current year and forms the foundation of Van Lanschot Kempen's operational risk management measurement system. A total of 97 incidents (2022: 88 incidents) entailing a loss of more than \u20ac1,000 were logged in the database in 2023, resulting in a total loss of \u20ac0.8 million (2022: \u20ac1.2 million).\n- -Risk measurement: This is based on key risk indicators (early warnings), which highlight trends and/or provide prospective information about operational risks.\n- -Risk meetings: Periodic meetings with risk owners are held to monitor the development of the risk profile in relation to the risk appetite.\n\n## Information risk\n\nInformation risk relates to the protection of client and corporate information. Both automated and manual information processing are carried out. Taking the right measures on the basis of targeted risk analyses of business and IT processes ensures that both our client data and our corporate data are adequately protected and access to this data is ensured.\n\n## Third-party risk\n\nIn line with our strategy, we outsource certain processes to carefully selected third parties. From an operational risk perspective, this means replacing processing and transaction risks with third-party risk, which is defined as follows: the risk of failing to manage third-party relationships and risk appropriately. A comprehensive risk control framework is in place to handle third-party risk. Contracts containing access",

        "page_content": "and audit rights as well as independent assurance on thirdparty performance are included in this framework.\n\n## Fraud risk\n\nThe main mitigants for fraud risk are strong processes with checks and balances (i.e. the four-eyes principle) and access control. Internal fraud risk is defined as the risk of unexpected financial, material or reputational loss as the result of the fraudulent actions of people internal to the organisation. Incidents such as internal fraud cases are dealt with in accordance with the incident management procedure, which requires a root cause analysis to be conducted, and adequate follow-up to prevent reoccurrence. In 2023, no internal fraud event was identified nor any attempt to commit internal fraud. No investigation of any person regarding internal fraud therefore needed to be conducted.\n\nExternal fraud risk is defined as fraud attempted or perpetrated against the organisation by an external party (i.e. a party without a direct relationship to Van Lanschot Kempen) without the involvement of an employee or affiliate of the organisation. We recognise that there is an increasing trend of external fraud risk in both attempts and total impact and we are continuously improving our capabilities for detecting, stopping or recovering external fraud attempts.\n\n## Business continuity management\n\nBusiness continuity analyses are carried out as part of our business continuity management process in order to gain insight into critical processes and the resources needed to ensure continuity of service and address potential threats. Embedding business continuity management in the organisation is essential to give the bank sufficient resilience against the impact of an incident or disaster. Business continuity thus has universal scope within the bank; it comprises policies, standards and procedures aimed at safeguarding critical processes or enabling a restart within a specified timeframe in the event of a disaster. The objective is to keep any financial, reputational and/or other material damage to a minimum, both for us and for our clients. Procedures are tested on a regular basis, with tests of fallback procedures and crisis governance carried out every year. Furthermore, crisis management teams and crisis support teams are trained regularly in crisis management techniques, and practise using case studies.\n\n## 12. Compliance risk\n\nWhen operating in financial markets, it is important that we conduct our business activities in accordance with the expectations of our clients, employees, shareholders and supervisory authorities. We also follow high ethical standards, in alignment with our shared values, code of conduct and risk appetite, and within the boundaries of applicable laws, rules, regulations, internal policies, procedures and industry standards relevant for our business. Van Lanschot Kempen has established a compliance framework to manage compliance risks appropriately, to ensure business operations adhere to laws, rules and regulations, and to make sure we act in the best interests of our clients. The compliance framework applies across the entire organisation, including international locations.\n\nCompliance risk can be described as the threat posed to our organisation's financial, organisational or reputational standing resulting from violations of regulatory requirements, industry standards or internal policies and procedures. Non-compliance with these requirements could\n\npotentially result in reputational damage, claims from clients or other stakeholders, enforcement actions from legal and supervisory authorities, fines and other liabilities, even the potential loss of licence, which could negatively impact our business, results and profitability, and the financial sector as a whole.\n\nIn addition, the regulatory landscape governing the financial sector is becoming more dynamic, and complex, while regulators are also becoming more critical. Being compliant with applicable laws and regulations and continuing to stay abreast of new emerging trends is resources-intensive.\n\n## Financial crime risks\n\nAs a gatekeeper of the financial system, we face the potential risk of being accidentally involved in illegal activities related to financial and economic crimes, such as money laundering, tax evasion and financing of terrorism. As a result, we may face reputational damage, fines, or other sanctions from regulators, which could significantly impact our organisation.\n\n## Client protection risks\n\nTo make sure that we act in the best interest of our clients, a thorough product governance process is conducted when offering, developing, or distributing (new) financial products and services. This also relates to marketing and communication materials. Our organisation is mainly exposed to the risk of claims from clients, shareholders or other stakeholders who might feel treated unfairly because of information or advice received or because products or services have not met their expectations.\n\n## Business conduct risks\n\nBusiness conduct risks refer to the potential of our organisation's actions to negatively impact the financial markets, clients, or other stakeholders, including society as a whole. Adverse effects on market stability, market abuse or misconduct by employees could negatively impact our organisation and result in reputational damage, fines or enforcement actions by legal and supervisory authorities. It is crucial that we maintain and safeguard the integrity of the financial system and conduct our business in line with applicable laws and regulations. Business conduct risks are managed by having proper policies and processes in place, as well as promoting ethical behaviour and responsible business conduct among employees.\n\n## Personal data integrity risks\n\nPersonal data integrity risks relate to data privacy, data retention and adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We operate a personal data integrity programme to protect the data of clients and employees, to support the organisation in its obligations and to foster awareness, as well as to establish internal policies, advise on data privacy matters and monitor compliance with data privacy laws.\n\n## 13. Financial reporting risk\n\nThe Management Board is responsible for designing and implementing an adequate system of internal control for our financial reporting. The system is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of financial reporting and that the financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and applicable legislation and regulations.",

        "page_content": "We have the following tools in place to manage financial reporting risks:\n\n- -Periodic management reports and KPI dashboards, accompanied by analysis of financial and non-financial figures and trends;\n- -A risk and control framework describing processes and procedures, and setting out primary controls such as authorisations and segregation of duties;\n- -The findings from the review of the operational effectiveness of the internal control system by Internal Audit, which are discussed with the Management Board, the Audit Committee and the Supervisory Board;\n- -The Van Lanschot Kempen Accounting Manual, which sets out the principles we pursue with respect to financial accounting;\n- -Assessment and approval of the annual report by the Management Board and discussion of this by the Audit Committee and by the Supervisory Board.\n\nThe management teams of the relevant divisions have provided the Management Board with in-control statements on the extent of internal control, based on the results of testing procedures for the risk and control framework, the risks reported on a quarterly basis, the follow-up of these risks, and the incidents reported. Risk Management and Compliance have evaluated these statements and verified that the business is in control. As well as mitigating reporting risk, in-control statements are a key cornerstone of the organisation's operational resilience.\n\n## 14. Fair value\n\n## 14.1 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA portion of the financial instruments are measured at fair value in the statement of financial position. Tables 14.1.A and 14.1.B provide a breakdown of these instruments into three levels. The fair value is based either on quoted prices in active markets, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable in the market, or inputs based on data not observable in the market.\n\nWe have developed a policy on the criteria for allocating financial instruments recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value to each of the three levels. A review is carried out at the end of each reporting period to determine whether any changes have taken place in the hierarchy between the levels.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in an active market (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. Using estimates, we make assumptions based on the market conditions (observable data) at the reporting date.\n\nThe estimated present value of future cash flows is used to determine the fair value of the other financial instruments. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows. The discount rate is the same as the market interest rate at the reporting date for a similar instrument subject to the same conditions, taking into account collateral furnished under credit support annexes (CSAs).\n\nThe fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to forward exchange rates at the reporting date. This is subsequently discounted to determine the present value.\n\nEstimates and judgements made are based on past experience as well as other factors, including expectations with respect to future events that could reasonably occur given current circumstances. Estimates and judgements are assessed on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Level 3: Significance of unobservable market data\n\nThe financial instruments in this category are assessed on an individual basis. Their valuation is based on the best estimate of management by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market. Unobservable inputs may include volatility, correlation, seasonality and credit spreads.\n\nA valuation technique is used in which at least one input that has a significant effect on the instrument's valuation is not based on observable market data. Valuation techniques used include:\n\n- -The net asset value method;\n- -Discounted cash flow projections based on reliable estimates of future cash flows;\n- -The option model.\n\nA significant effect on the instrument's valuation is considered to be present when the unobservable input accounts for at least 10% of the total instrument's fair value and exceeds a threshold of \u20ac50,000. The effect of fair value adjustments on the instrument's valuation is included in the assessment.",

This divides the variables used into observable and unobservable market inputs. If the unobservable input variables are significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. An unobservable input variable is significant if the change in the fair value due to the application of the variable is greater than the threshold values. Our policy is to recognise transfers into and out of fair value hierarchy levels at the end of the reporting period.\n\nIn 2023, our valuation technique remained unchanged, with non-observable input variables being assessed on significance. As a result of this assessment, some financial instruments included in Derivatives (liabilities) and in Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss have been transferred from Level 2 to Level 3 and vice versa.\n\nThe Derivatives receivables and payables and Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss were transferred to Level 2 as a result of the input variables' correlation and seasonality; the shorter remaining term to maturity of these financial instruments meant that these input variables qualified as non-significant, justifying a transfer to Level 2. In the case of Derivatives (assets), there were no transfers from Level 2 to Level 3 and vice versa. In the case of Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, it involved transfers of \u20ac43.0 million from Level 3 to Level 2, there where no transfers from Level 2 to 3. The transfer of Derivatives (liabilities) includes a \u20ac3.8 million shift from Level 3 to Level 2.\n\n## Breakdown of movements in financial assets and liabilities classified under Level 3",

If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in Table 14.2 are estimated on the basis of the present value or using other estimation or valuation methods.\n\nTable 14.2 shows the carrying amount and fair value of financial instruments at amortised cost, with the exception of line items Cash and cash equivalents and balances at central banks, Other assets and Other liabilities. For these financial instruments the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of the fair value.\n\n|                                                       | 31/12/2023 Carrying                               | 31/12/2022 Carrying Level                         | 31/12/2022 Carrying Level                        | 31/12/2022 Carrying Level   |                                                                                                                                                           |                                                             |             |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n|                                                       | Fair value                                        | amount Fair value                                 | amount                                           |                             | Valuation method                                                                                                                                          | Significant observable  and unobservable  market inputs     |             |\n| Assets                                                | Assets                                            | Assets                                            | Assets                                           | Assets                      | Assets                                                                                                                                                    | Assets                                                      | Assets      |\n| Due from banks                                        | 77,296                                            | 77,501    107,613                                 | 108,186                                          | 2                           | Discounted cash flows using  applicable money market                                                                                                      | Interest rate and  discount rate                            |             |\n| Loans and advances to the  public and private sectors | 8,602,008    9,161,433    8,799,384    9,363,958  |                                                   |                                                  | 3                           | Discounted cash flows using  current market fees for  comparable loans and taking  into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty                | Interest rate, discount  rate and counterparty  credit risk |             |\n| Other financial assets at  amortised cost             |                                                   |                                                   | 1,198,442    1,201,134    1,056,539    1,088,358 | 1                           | Quoted prices in active  markets                                                                                                                          | -

These correspond to our operating segments (see \"Segment information\") except for CGU Non-strategic investments. Segment Other is split between the CGUs Other and Nonstrategic investments.\n\nThe performance of the Private Clients segment was strong in 2023, mainly due to higher net interest margins and increased net commission income. The Wholesale & Institutional Clients segment had a negative result in 2023, despite net AuM inflows and positive market performance. In 2023, we took a series of additional measures to further accelerate profitable growth. As part of this, we simplified the segment's organisational structure and structurally reduced costs. The projected financial results do not indicate a trigger for impairment. The difficult market conditions put corporate finance results at Investment Banking Clients under pressure. This segment struggled in 2023 due to difficult market circumstances, in line with other market participants. However, sentiment showed some sign of improvement in the last quarter of 2023 and we anticipate a further recovery from 2024 onwards.\n\n| Allocation of goodwill to CGUs (based on segments)   | 2023    | 2022    |\n|------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Total                                                | 179,363 | 176,761 |\n| Private Clients                                      | 122,040 | 119,437 |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients                    | 16,031  | 16,031  |\n| Investment Banking Clients                           | 41,293  | 41,293  |",

        "page_content": "## Methodology\n\nIn line with IFRS, the recoverable amount is determined as the higher of the fair value less costs of disposal (FVLCOD) and value in use (ViU). We carried out our annual impairment test on goodwill arising from acquisitions in prior years. To determine whether an impairment is necessary, the recoverable amount of each CGU or group of CGUs is compared with its carrying amount. The value in use calculation uses equity cash flow projections for each CGU or group of CGUs for a five-year period. These projections are based on the current year and on the financial estimates for the years 2024 until 2027 used by management in its strategic forecast at the end of 2023. For the period after the explicit projections per CGU or group of CGUs, the growth rate is set at the long-term market growth rate of 2.0%. This growth rate applies to all CGUs, as in the long term all CGUs will be impacted by the same economic market developments. The rate is based on our own projections and on wealth management market projections by market experts.\n\n## Change in accounting estimate\n\nIn previous years, only the value in use was used to calculate the recoverable amount. For CGU Investment Banking Clients, the fair value less costs of disposal analysis was also applied this year.\n\nThe market price at valuation date of our peer group within the Investment Banking segment and their average earnings for a five-year reference period (2021-25) are used to calculate the price-earnings (PE) multiple. The recoverable amount is calculated using the median price-earnings ratio and the average earnings of CGU Investment Banking Clients over a five-year period, including projections for 2023, 2024 and 2025 based on management's strategic forecast.\n\nManagement has compared the main assumptions with market forecasts and expectations. Cash flow estimates are based on our strategic plans and on potential future trends. Events and factors that could have a significant impact on the estimates include stock and bond market developments, effects of mergers and acquisitions, competitive conditions, client behaviour and changes in client relationships, cost structure, trends in inflation, interest rates and risks, and other circumstances specific to the industry and sector. Equity cash flows are discounted using a cost of equity for each CGU or group of CGUs that reflects the risk-free interest rate, supplemented with a surcharge for the market risk exposure of the CGU or group of CGUs, and a small-firm premium.\n\n| CGU                               | Method used             | Discount rate after tax %   |   Discount rate after tax % | PE multiple   | PE multiple   |\n|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------|---------------|\n|                                   | for recoverable  amount | 2023                        |                      2022   | 2023          | 2022          |\n| Private Clients                   | ViU                     | 11.1                        |                         9.7 | n/a           | n/a           |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients | ViU                     | 13.2                        |                        12.1 | n/a           | n/a           |\n| Investment Banking Clients        | FVLCOD                  | n/a                         |                        11.5 | 14.9          | n/a           |\n\nThe impairment test performed in 2023 did not result in goodwill impairments. The discounted cash flow model uses one base-case scenario. For the CGUs with allocated goodwill, a sensitivity analysis was also carried out on the base-case scenario with particular attention on changes in long-term growth, the discount rate and the long-term EBIT margin.\n\nThe recoverable amount of CGU Investment Banking Clients is sensitive to projected earnings and the PE multiple. A decrease of 10% in projected cash flows or a reduction of the PE multiple of 1 percentage point are considered reasonable possible changes in key assumptions. The analysis is captured in the sensitivity tables below and supports our conclusion that no impairment is needed.\n\nIn addition, an annual test is carried out for indications of impairment of other intangible assets with a finite useful life. The acquired brand names are still active and no objective indication for impairment was apparent at year-end 2023. For the line item Client relationships, changes in the AuM volume are assessed. The useful life tests carried out in 2023 provided no indication of a need for further examination. Consequently, no impairment is recognised for other intangible assets.\n\n| Sensitivity analysis value in use method               | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Change required in each key assumption for headroom to  equal zero, in percentage points   | Headroom with  terminal growth rate at            |\n|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                        | Headroom                                                                                   | Net profit margin                                                                          | Cost of equity                                                                             | 0%                                                |\n| Private Clients                                        | 677,836                                                                                    | -18.3 %                                                                                    | 9.4 %                                                                                      | 571,084                                           |\n| Wholesale & Institutional Clients                      | 123,125                                                                                    | -18.8 %                                                                                    | 19.5 %                                                                                     | 104,529                                           |\n| Sensitivity analysis fair value less costs of disposal |                                                                                            | Headroom                                                                                   | Headroom with -10%  projected earnings for  2024 and 2025                                  | Adjusted PE multiple  for headroom to equal  zero |\n| Investment Banking Clients                             |                                                                                            | 36,726                                                                                     | 33,905                                                                                     | 9.1                                               |\n| Expected amortisation of intangible assets             | 2024                                                                                       | 2025 2026                                                                                  | 2027                                                                                       | 2028 2029-43                                      |\n| Total                                                  | 16,023                                                                                     | 13,712    13,710                                                                           | 12,396                                                                                     | 11,301    67,639                                  |",

Specifically, there is a pension scheme and a discount scheme for mortgage interest rates, as well as a long-service benefits scheme.\n\nThe following defined benefit schemes were valued for the purpose of the 2023 financial statements:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen employees were eligible for discounted mortgage interest rates. Entitlement to this discount continues beyond retirement from active service. This plan was closed to new entrants after 2015.\n- -The long-service benefits depend on the number of years of service.\n- -Both a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme are in place for employees working at the Belgian branch. The pensionable salary for the defined benefit scheme is taken as the average basic salary over the last five years of service. The pension capital is insured with UKZT (Uitgesteld Kapitaal Zonder Tegenverzekering). The accompanying term life assurance is funded from risk premiums. The defined contribution pension plans have been set up according to the Belgian method of defined contributions but do not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the defined contribution pension plans are treated as a defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.",

        "page_content": "- -Until year-end 2019, former Kempen & Co operated an average salary scheme under which 1.875% of the pensionable salary - salary less state pension offset, with an annual ceiling of \u20ac41,232 - was accrued for each year of service and which was based on a retirement age of 68. The surviving dependants' pension was insured on a risk basis.\n- -The pension plan of Van Lanschot Kempen (Schweiz) AG has been set up according to the Swiss method of defined contributions but does not fulfil all the criteria of a defined contribution pension plan according to IAS 19. For this reason, the Swiss pension plan is treated as defined benefit plan in the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOnly within our Kempen pension scheme, plan assets fund the obligations (i.e. the scheme is funded). The other schemes are unfunded; payments in any year are made directly by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nThe pension schemes have been placed with insurers and a pension institution, which are responsible for the pension administration, risk insurance and communication of legal\n\ndocuments to employees who are scheme members. Decisions on and changes to pension scheme content are taken by an internal pensions committee. Where applicable, in the Netherlands the Works Council is consulted for its advice and/or approval.\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's pension schemes were adjusted and replaced from 1 January 2020 by a single new plan. The new scheme is an individual defined contribution scheme. The former Van Lanschot scheme is classified as a collective defined contribution scheme, and the change of scheme has no impact from an accounting perspective. Because there is still an obligation to pay guarantee costs and to provide indexation on the accrued pension benefits, the remainder of the provision (\u20ac27.9 million) stays on the balance sheet. As it has no legally enforceable right to use the surplus in plan assets for settling the obligations for indexation and guarantee costs, Van Lanschot Kempen applies an asset ceiling to the relevant assets in the pension scheme.\n\nDefined benefit obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method.\n\n| Obligations/assets included in the statement of financial position by scheme  at 31/12/2023   | Pensions   | Employee  discounts   | Long-service  benefits   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Defined benefit obligations                                                                   | 168,056    | 53                    | 3,007                    |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                                     | 145,005    | -                     | -                        |\n| Surplus/deficit                                                                               | -23,051    | -53                   | -3,007                   |\n| Obligation at year-end                                                                        | -23,051    | -53                   | -3,007                   |\n\n| Obligations/assets included in the statement of financial position by scheme  at 31/12/2022   | Pensions   | Employee  discounts   | Long-service  benefits   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|\n| Defined benefit obligations                                                                   | 162,144    | 53                    | 2,617                    |\n| Fair value of plan assets                                                                     | 139,039    | -                     | -                        |\n| Surplus/deficit                                                                               | -23,105    | -53                   | -2,617                   |\n| Obligation at year-end                                                                        | -23,105    | -53                   | -2,617                   |\n\n| Changes in defined benefit obligations for pension scheme      | 2023    | 2022    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Defined benefit obligations at 1 January                       | 162,144 | 248,435 |\n| Current service costs                                          | 2,893   | 2,610   |\n| Interest costs                                                 | 5,869   | 2,744   |\n| Members' contributions                                         | 413     | 368     |\n| Gross benefits                                                 | -4,672  | -3,171  |\n| Transfers                                                      | -564    | -501    |\n| Remeasurements arising from changes in financial assumptions   | 2,312   | -91,099 |\n| Remeasurements arising from changes in demographic assumptions | -501    | -5      |\n| Experience adjustments                                         | -435    | 2,275   |\n| Effect of foreign exchange rates                               | 597     | 488     |\n| Defined benefit obligations at 31 December                     | 168,056 | 162,144 |\n\nAt 31 December 2023, the weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation was 18 years (2022: 21 years).",

The changed interest rate environment during 2022 and 2023 had a positive effect on our net interest income. The interest rate on what were predominantly deposits at central banks, variable-rate loans and mortgages, including interest rate swaps, rose more sharply than the rates on client savings accounts and deposits.\n\nThe interest income on balances at central banks consists of the interest received on overnight deposits at DNB as well as the negative interest paid in 2022 on the TLTRO III loan recognised under Due to banks. The loan was repaid in December 2022.\n\nThe interest result on loans subject to impairment was \u20ac2.0 million (2022: \u20ac1.0 million).\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, the interest charges related to the medium term notes (\u20ac19.1 million; 2022: \u20ac2.8 million) are reported under Other interest expense. This provides enhanced insight into the figures in accordance with IAS 1. Previously, this was reported under Result on financial transactions. Comparative figures have not been restated.",

This was mainly driven by three items. First, a negative result of \u20ac3.4 million on futures that are used to hedge co-investments in own products in 2023, compared with a positive result in 2022 of \u20ac11.5 million. Second, ineffectiveness in our hedge accounting model resulted in a loss of \u20ac1.8 million (2022: gain of \u20ac9.3 million). This was partly offset as 2022 included  an expense of \u20ac18.7 million, related to the acquisition of the remaining 30% stake in Mercier Vanderlinden by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nFrom 1 January 2023, the interest charges related to the medium term notes are reclassified from Gains/losses on financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss to Other interest expenses.

Depositary receipts granted in 2023 had a weighted average fair value of \u20ac18.97 (2022: \u20ac16.89).\n\nIn 2023, 10,472 conditional depositary receipts for shares were granted under the LTP to a number of senior managers other than members of the Management Board (2022: 14,003).\n\n## Long-term share plan\n\nThe long-term share plan allows us to award variable remuneration to certain key employees, including identified staff.

For LTP plans from 2023 onwards, 40% are awarded conditionally over a period of four years. Conditional depositary receipts for shares will vest if:\n\n- (i) Van Lanschot Kempen's financial position allows this in the year of vesting;\n- (ii) Risks have been reviewed and no material, unforeseen risks have occurred;\n- (iii) The individual has not left the company in the three- or four-year period.\n\nConditional variable remuneration can be revised down if so prompted by risks and performances identified later (malus).\n\nEmployees do not receive any dividends during the vesting period. If an employee ceases to be employed by Van Lanschot Kempen within this period, their rights will be forfeited, except in limited circumstances judged on an individual basis.\n\nA proportion (around 50%) of the conditionally awarded depositary receipts is used to pay income tax.\n\n## 29.

Changes in the effective tax rate were mainly due to the equity holding exemption and non-deductible expenses.\n\nIn December 2022, EU member states adopted the EU Directive on minimum taxation (Pillar 2). Under this directive, multinational companies are subject to a minimum effective tax rate of 15% in every jurisdiction where they have an entity. If the effective tax rate is lower than 15%, a top-up tax is applied to reach a 15% effective tax burden.\n\nCompanies with a global turnover exceeding \u20ac750 million in at least two of the four reporting years immediately preceding the reporting year fall within the scope of Pillar 2. As of 2024, the Minimum Tax Act, in which Pillar 2 is formalised, will be effective in the Netherlands. Our consolidated revenues in the 2020-22 period were below \u20ac750 million; in 2023 they ended up above that figure. Hence, neither the mandatory recognition and disclosure exception in IAS 12.4A nor the disclosure requirements in IAS 12.88A-88D apply to us at this point.\n\n| Key income tax components                               | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total                                                   | 39,017 | 34,678 |\n| Income tax                                              | 42,099 | 44,312 |\n| Income/expense from foreign tax rate differences        | 521    | 203    |\n| Income/expense from changes in deferred tax assets      | -1,037 | -4,640 |\n| Income/expense from changes in deferred tax liabilities | -3,048 | -6,089 |\n| Income/expense from prior-year adjustments              | 481    | 892    |\n\nThe breakdown of deferred tax assets and liabilities through the statement of income is as follows:\n\n| Deferred tax assets     | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Total                   | -1,037 | -4,640 |\n| Employee benefits       | 1,002  | -709   |\n| Commissions             | -43    | -43    |\n| Property and equipment  | 19     | -216   |\n| Lease liabilities       | -584   | -1,978 |\n| Tax-loss carry-forwards | -1,006 | -1,907 |\n| Other                   | -424   | 214    |",

        "page_content": "## Business combinations in 2023\n\nOn 2 February 2023, we announced a strategic partnership with Robeco. This acquisition is in line with our strategy and enables us to further grow our online investment proposition by expanding our asset management activities and distribution activities (execution only) for Dutch retail customers. The assets acquired included Robeco's client relationships, brand name and Robeco's online investment platform, which have been joined with Evi van Lanschot. On 3 July 2023, Van Lanschot Kempen announced the completion of this transaction. We included Robeco's online investment platform in our statement of financial position as at 1 July 2023, as part of our Private Clients segment.\n\nAt year-end 2023, both platforms had a combined \u20ac6.4 billion in AuM held for around 150,000 clients. The transaction had a negative impact on Van Lanschot Kempen's CET 1 ratio of 0.4 percentage points. A two-year integration path is anticipated, and is expected to involve one-off costs of between \u20ac8 million and \u20ac11 million. The combined platform is expected to break even by 2025 and to start making a positive contribution to Van Lanschot Kempen's net profit thereafter.\n\nThe table below sets out the allocation of the acquisition price to the fair value of the acquired assets (including any identifiable intangible assets) and liabilities at the acquisition date. The identifiable intangible assets reflect the acquired client relationships, brand name and IT platform.

These are designed in such a way that the voting rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, and the relevant activities are governed by contractual arrangements. Van Lanschot Kempen is exposed to substantially all of the risk of the structured entity and thereby controls it. Therefore, these structured entities do not qualify as a transfer of financial assets and are not derecognised from our statement of financial position.\n\nWe consolidate the following structured entities:\n\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company BV;\n- -Van Lanschot Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond Company 2 BV;\n- -Van Lanschot Kempen SB Covered Bond Company BV.\n\n## Public Conditional Pass-Through (CPT) Covered Bond programme\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a CPT programme in March 2015, out of which Van Lanschot Kempen has issued publicly placed bonds since. Investors have a dual recourse claim: initially against Van Lanschot Kempen, and, in the event of the bank's failure, against a pool of cover assets. One of the outstanding CPT Covered Bonds matured in the first half of 2023, while we were able to transfer the last outstanding CPT to the Soft Bullet Covered Bond (SBCB) programme. This means the CPT programme no longer has any bonds outstanding and will be discontinued (initiated in December 2023). We expect to complete this operation in March 2024.\n\n## Retained Conditional Pass-Through (CPT) Covered Bond programme\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen established a retained CPT programme in July 2019. In September 2019, the bank launched the first bond of \u20ac300 million (maturity of five years, coupon of 0.4%). This bond was increased by \u20ac200 million to \u20ac500 million in June 2023. All bonds were retained.",

A second bond was issued in May 2023 (maturity of three years, coupon of 3.5%). Finally, in October 2023 a bond was transferred from the CPT to the SBCB programme. All bonds were placed with institutional investors.\n\nThe table below shows the total amounts of the mortgage loans involved in each covered bond programme.\n\n| Structured entities (\u20ac1,000)                              | 31/12/2023   | 31/12/2023      | 31/12/2022   | 31/12/2022      |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n|                                                           | Fair value   | Carrying amount | Fair value   | Carrying amount |\n| Total                                                     | 2,471,899    | 2,700,817       | 2,063,721    | 2,296,648       |\n| Public Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond  programme   | -            | -               | 1,123,293    | 1,259,599       |\n| Retained Conditional Pass-Through Covered Bond  programme | 546,070      | 604,964         | 317,479      | 352,870         |\n| Public Soft Bullet Covered Bond programme                 | 1,925,829    | 2,095,853       | 622,949      | 684,179         |\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen provides no financial or other support to the covered bond entities, and has no intention of providing such support.\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities\n\nResidential mortgage-backed securities are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income or other financial assets at amortised cost . These investments are structured entities. We do not consolidate these because Van Lanschot Kempen is not substantially exposed to all of the risk of the structured entity. The table below shows Van Lanschot Kempen's investments in nonconsolidated structured entities and the total income from these investments. The Investments column shows the carrying value as recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities 2023 (\u20ac1,000)\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen has no other interests in nonconsolidated structured entities such as commitments, guarantees, provisions, derivatives or other obligations. The maximum exposure to non-consolidated structured entities is equal to the acquisition cost and amounted to \u20ac276.3 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: \u20ac285.7 million).\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen is not required to provide financial or other support to non-consolidated structured entities, and has no intention of providing such support.\n\n|                                        | Interest income   |   Impairment | Comprehensive income   | Total income   | Investments   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Total                                  | 2,473             |          -17 | 1,982                  | 4,438          | 289,729       |\n| Residential mortgage-backed securities | 2,473             |          -17 | 1,982                  | 4,438          | 289,729       |\n\n## Non-consolidated structured entities 2022 (\u20ac1,000)\n\n|                                        |   Interest income | Impairment   |   Comprehensive income |   Total income | Investments   |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------------|----------------|---------------|\n| Total                                  |               848 | -            |                   -963 |           -116 | 280,686       |\n| Residential mortgage-backed securities |               848 | -            |                   -963 |           -116 | 280,686       |\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nThe consolidated statement of financial position and statement of income include a number of non-controlling interests; a list of non-controlling interests in Van Lanschot Kempen subsidiaries is provided below.\n\n| Non-controlling interests (\u20ac1,000)   |   31/12/2023 |   31/12/2022 |\n|--------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Total                                |           93 |          146 |\n| Consolidated investment funds        |           93 |          146 |\n\nVan Lanschot Kempen's minority interests are recognised under non-controlling interests as part of equity.",

This includes positions arising from group companies. The fair value of financial instruments at amortised cost is taken as the amount for which the instrument could be exchanged in a\n\ncommercial transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. If there is an active market, we use the market value to determine the fair value. For financial instruments for which no market prices are available, the fair values shown in the table are estimated on the basis of the present value or other estimation or valuation methods.\n\n|                                                         | 2023                                              | 2023                                | 2022                                | 2022                                               |                             |                                                                                                                                                        |\n|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                                         | Fair value                                        | Carrying  amount                    | Fair value                          | Carrying  amount                                   | Valued using                | Valuation method                                                                                                                                       |\n| Assets                                                  |                                                   |                                     |                                     |                                                    |                             |                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Government paper eligible for central  bank refinancing | 91,977                                            | 91,102                              | 157,214                             | 160,701                                            | Listed market prices        | Listed market prices                                                                                                                                   |\n| Due from banks                                          | 253,385                                           | 255,087                             | 208,257                             | 210,186                                            | Observable market  inputs   | Discounted cash flows  using applicable money  market rates                                                                                            |\n| Loans and advances to the public and  private sectors   |                                                   | 8,460,994    8,984,652    8,670,181 |                                     | 9,193,697                                          | Unobservable market  inputs | Discounted cash flows  using current market fees  for comparable loans and  taking into account the  creditworthiness of the  counterparty             |\n| Debt instruments                                        |                                                   |                                     |                                     |                                                    |                             |                                                                                                                                                        |\n| -

The transaction is expected to be completed in 2024, subject to regulatory approval. The intended acquisition is expected to result in a negative 0.4 percentage point impact on our CET 1 ratio.\n\nOn 1 January 2024, the legal merger between Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management and Van Lanschot Kempen (the acquiring entity) became effective. As a result of this merger, Mercier Vanderlinden Asset Management ceased to exist as a legal entity. Van Lanschot Belgium's trade name changed to Mercier Van Lanschot as from 1 January 2024.\n\nOn 22 January 2024, we launched and priced \u20ac100 million of Additional Tier 1 (AT1) notes with a fixed coupon of 8.875%. The notes are listed on Euronext Amsterdam. Settlement of these notes took place on 29 January 2024, and we intend to call our 2019-issued AT1 notes at the first call date of 1 April 2024.\n\n's-Hertogenbosch, 21 February 2024\n\n## Supervisory Board\n\n- -Frans Blom, Chair\n- -Manfred Schepers, Vice-Chair\n- -Karin Bergstein\n- -Brigitte Boone\n- -Maarten Muller\n- -Elizabeth Nolan\n\n## Management Board\n\n- - Maarten Edixhoven, Chair\n- -Jeroen Kroes\n- -Wendy Winkelhuijzen\n- -Arjan Huisman\n- -Richard Bruens\n- -Erik van Houwelingen",

The Stichting's policy is solely aimed at pursuing what is described in its objects clause as included in Article 2 of its Articles of Association ( statutaire doelomschrijving ). Its activities exclusively concern holding and managing shares in Van Lanschot Kempen; the Stichting does not engage in any commercial activities.\n\nIn line with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, at every Van Lanschot Kempen general meeting the Stichting grants a proxy to depositary receipt holders that either attend the meeting in person or are represented by a third party. In other words, depositary receipt holders can always vote at their own discretion for the number of shares for which they hold depositary receipts.\n\nIn 2023, the Stichting's activities consisted of:\n\n- \u00b7 Convening board meetings (at which the matters mentioned below were discussed);\n- \u00b7 Granting proxies for Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings;\n- \u00b7 Attending Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings; and\n- \u00b7 Exercising the voting rights on Van Lanschot Kempen shares held by the Stichting at Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings, to the extent that no proxies had been granted to depositary receipt holders;\n- \u00b7 Reviewing a proposal for the remuneration policies of the Management and Supervisory Boards.\n\nThe Stichting will continue to pursue its policies and activities in 2024 in accordance with its objects clause and in keeping with past practice. No changes in the activities of the Stichting in 2024 are foreseen.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen (in the year 2023 this amounted to \u20ac54,675). The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as audit fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2024 to be similar to the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2023.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2023, the Board held three board meetings. The topics covered in these meetings included:\n\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2022 financial statements;\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 25 May 2023 ('the AGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's 2023 half-year results; and\n- \u00b7 The agenda of the extraordinary general meeting of Van Lanschot Kempen held on 5 October 2023 ('the EGM') and the Stichting's voting intentions.\n\n## Van Lanschot Kempen's general meetings\n\nThe Board attended the AGM and the EGM. The Stichting granted proxy votes to holders of depositary receipts for shares that attended these meetings in person or were represented by third parties. This enabled these depositary receipt holders to vote at their own discretion for the number of Class A ordinary shares corresponding to the depositary receipts of Class A ordinary shares held by them at record date. The Stichting voted, at its own discretion, on the Class A ordinary shares for which no proxy votes had been requested. Such shares represented 36.37% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the AGM and 36.87% of the total number of votes that could be cast at the EGM.\n\nThe Board carefully considered each of the items put to the ballot and after due consideration decided to vote in favour of all items put to the ballot. This included the remuneration report for the year 2022, the discharge of the Management and Supervisory Boards, the appointment of the independent auditor, the composition of the Supervisory Board and the return of capital by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\nIn addition, the Board had a meeting with the Remuneration Committee to discuss a proposal for the remuneration policies of the Management Board and the Supervisory Board. This meeting was one of a series of engagement meetings that were held by the Remuneration Committee to get feedback on their proposals.\n\n## Composition of the Board\n\nThe Board's current members are:\n\nR.W.Th. Norbruis, Chair C.M.P. Mennen-Vermeule, Secretary\n\nW.F. Hendriksen\n\nMr Norbruis is a partner at Norbruis Clement Advocaten.\n\nMs Mennen-Vermeule is the former Chief Executive Officer of Brand Loyalty Group.\n\nMr Hendriksen is a partner at Van Doorne.\n\nThe annual remuneration of the Chair of the Board amounts to \u20ac10,000 (excluding VAT) and that of each other Board member to \u20ac7,500 (excluding VAT).\n\n## Expenses\n\nOther expenses incurred by the Stichting amounted to \u20ac25,710 in 2023.\n\n## Outstanding depositary receipts\n\nOn 31 December 2023, the Stichting held 43,036,928 Class A ordinary shares, constituting 99.99% of the shares in Van Lanschot Kempen, with a nominal value of \u20ac1 each, for which depositary receipts with the same nominal value have been issued.",

The Stichting pursues its purpose by acquiring Class C preference shares in the capital of Van Lanschot Kempen, and by exercising the rights attached to these shares.\n\nThe Stichting and Van Lanschot Kempen have signed a call option agreement granting the Stichting the right to acquire Class C preference shares up to 100% of the value of Van Lanschot Kempen's share capital in issue before the exercise of the call option, less one share. When acquiring Class C preference shares, the Stichting is required to pay a minimum of 25% of the nominal amount. To ensure it will be able to pay when the time comes, the Stichting has a funding agreement with ING Bank in place. Van Lanschot Kempen aims to keep any period with outstanding Class C preference shares as brief as possible, and has committed itself to a maximum of one year as the term within which Van Lanschot Kempen will propose to the general meeting to redeem any Class C preference shares.\n\nThe Stichting's policy is exclusively aimed at pursuing the purpose as described above. The Stichting does not in any way engage in commercial activities, or any other type of activities as long as there are no circumstances that, pursuant to its objects clause, would give the Stichting cause to act and exercise its powers.\n\nIn 2023, the Stichting's activities consisted of convening a Board meeting as well as holding ad hoc consultations as and when required.\n\nThe Stichting's income consists of an 'independence donation' paid by Van Lanschot Kempen (in 2023 this amounted to \u20ac158,876). The costs incurred by the Stichting typically only consist of a commitment fee due to ING Bank in relation to the funding agreement, the remuneration due to its Board members and administrative charges (such as audit fees). As the Stichting does not have any discretionary funds, it has no policies in place related to such spending. The Board expects the Stichting's budget for 2024 to be moderately higher than the budget (as well as the profit and loss account) for 2023 due to an increase in the commitment fee payable under the funding agreement with ING.\n\n## Board meetings\n\nIn 2023, the Board convened for one meeting. Topics discussed at that meeting included:\n\n- \u00b7 The state of affairs within Van Lanschot Kempen;\n- \u00b7 Van Lanschot Kempen's annual accounts for 2022;\n- \u00b7 The minutes of the Board meeting held in June 2022;\n- \u00b7 The amendment of the articles of association of the Stichting; and\n- \u00b7 The composition of the Board.\n\nIn 2023, a vacancy arose due to the expiry of the current term of Mr Swinkels in accordance with the appointment schedule. Mr Swinkels was not available for reappointment. The Board considered various candidates and selected Ms Van der Pauw as the preferred candidate. Ms Van der Pauw was appointed as member of the Board in June 2023.

        "page_content": "## Glossary\n\n## Advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB)\n\nThe most sophisticated credit risk measurement technique. Under A-IRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under A-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), exposure at default (EAD) and maturity (M).\n\n## Assets under discretionary management\n\nClient assets entrusted to Van Lanschot Kempen under a discretionary management agreement, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products or cash.\n\n## Assets under management (AuM)\n\nAssets deposited with Van Lanschot Kempen by clients, breaking down into assets under discretionary management and assets under non-discretionary management.\n\n## Assets under monitoring and guidance\n\nClient assets that are only subject to monitoring, plus minor advisory and related services. Clients make their own investment decisions and Van Lanschot Kempen has little or no influence on the management of these assets.\n\n## Assets under non-discretionary management\n\nAssets held for clients by Van Lanschot Kempen, irrespective of whether these assets are held in investment funds, deposits, structured products or cash, with either a Van Lanschot Kempen investment adviser advising the client on investment policy or clients making their own investment decisions without Van Lanschot Kempen's input.\n\n## Basel III\n\nThe framework drawn up by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, which introduced a stricter definition of capital and several new ratios and buffers with which banks must comply.\n\n## Basel IV\n\nThe reform of Basel III, commonly referred to as 'Basel IV', involves the final calibration and design of capital output floors, based on revised standardised approaches. It also includes reforms of the IRB approach and the standardised approach for credit and operational risk.\n\n## Capital conservation buffer\n\nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) requires Van Lanschot Kempen to maintain Common Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets as a capital conservation buffer. If an institution fails to maintain this capital conservation buffer, it will be restricted in making discretionary distributions.\n\n## Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR)\n\nSet of rules and regulations established by the European Union to regulate the capital requirements for banks. It determines the amount of capital that banks must hold to ensure their financial stability and resilience. The CRR framework includes elements such as minimum capital requirements, risk-weighted assets, and liquidity requirements that banks must comply with to meet the regulations.\n\n## Cash flow hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nInstruments to hedge the exposure to fluctuations in cash flows of assets, liabilities or future transactions, arising as a result of interest rate changes and/or inflation.\n\n## Client option positions\n\nClients are unable to buy or sell share options directly on the stock exchange. Van Lanschot Kempen purchases or sells on behalf of these clients and covers this with offsetting transactions on the stock exchange. Such receivables and payables are recognised under Derivatives.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital\n\nAlso referred to as core capital, CET 1 capital encompasses a bank's share capital, share premium and other reserves, adjusted for deductions as specified by regulators, such as goodwill, deferred tax assets and IRB shortfall.\n\n## Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) ratio\n\nCET 1 capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets.\n\n## Contingent liabilities\n\nAll commitments arising from transactions for which the bank has given a guarantee to third parties.\n\n## Cost/income ratio\n\nRatio of operating expenses (excluding costs incurred for special items) to income from operating activities.\n\n## Cost/income ratio (IFRS)\n\nOperating expenses excluding impairments and results from the sale of public and private sector loans and advances, as a percentage of income from operating activities.\n\n## Countercyclical capital buffer\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital equivalent to the total risk exposure amount (calculated in accordance with the CRR) multiplied by the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates. The countercyclical buffer rates are set by the designated authority in each EU member state on a quarterly basis. The buffer is determined by calculating the weighted average of the countercyclical buffer rates that apply in the jurisdictions of the relevant credit exposures.\n\n## CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis\n\nGenerally known by its Dutch acronym, CPB Netherlands' Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis is an independent research institute that provides policy-relevant economic analyses and projections, conducting research on the Dutch economy and on general socio-economic policy.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nThe risk that loans are not repaid, not fully repaid or not repaid on time.\n\n## Credit support annex (CSA)\n\nForming part of an international swaps and derivatives agreement (ISDA), a CSA regulates credit support (collateral) for obligations resulting from derivatives.\n\n## Credit valuation adjustment (CVA)\n\nAn adjustment made on the valuation of derivatives transactions with a counterparty, reflecting the current market value of counterparty credit risk.",

        "page_content": "## Currency options\n\nCurrency options grant their buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a quantity of a certain currency at a pre-determined exchange rate during or at the end of a predetermined period. The currency option constitutes an obligation for the seller. Van Lanschot Kempen's currency options mainly relate to client transactions covered by offsetting transactions in the markets.\n\n## De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB)\n\nThe Dutch central bank.\n\n## Defined benefit scheme\n\nA pension scheme other than a defined contribution scheme (see below). In a defined benefit scheme, the company has the constructive obligation to make up any deficit in the scheme. This does not have to be based on any legal requirements, but may be simply on the basis of an historical intention on the part of the company to make up any deficits.\n\n## Defined contribution scheme\n\nA scheme in which the company makes agreed contributions to a separate entity (a pension fund) to secure pension rights. The company is not obliged, either legally or effectively, to pay additional contributions if the pension fund does not have enough assets to cover all of its current and future obligations.\n\n## Delta economic value of equity ( \u0394 EVE)\n\nA long-term economic measure used to assess the degree of interest rate risk exposure. The measure reflects how changes in interest rates impact the value of the bank's assets and liabilities.\n\n## Delta net interest income ( \u0394 NII)\n\nA short-term analysis of the interest income under a number of market interest rate scenarios, relative to the baseline scenario in which interest rates are expected to develop based on forward rates.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nFinancial assets whose value derives from the value of other financial assets, indices or other variables. Van Lanschot Kempen holds both derivatives whose size (face value), conditions and prices are determined between Van Lanschot Kempen and its counterparties (OTC derivatives), and standardised derivatives traded on established markets.\n\n## Discounted cash flow (DCF)\n\nA method to value an investment by estimating future cash flows, taking account of the time value of money.\n\n## Duration of equity\n\nA measure of the interest rate sensitivity of equity that reflects the impact on equity of a 1% parallel shift in the interest curve.\n\n## Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM)\n\nThe Dutch regulator for financial institutions in the Netherlands.\n\n## Economic hedges\n\nDerivatives used to manage risks without applying hedge accounting, carried at fair value. At Van Lanschot Kempen, these primarily take the shape of interest rate derivatives.\n\n## Effective interest rate\n\nThe rate that discounts estimated cash flows to the net carrying amount of the financial asset over the life of an instrument, or, where appropriate, over a shorter period.\n\n## Engagement\n\nA sustainability strategy that seeks to persuade companies, fund managers, borrowers and other stakeholders through active dialogue that their sustainability policies should be made compatible with international treaties and conventions.\n\n## Environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nEnvironmental, social and governance factors are used to evaluate companies and countries on their progress in terms of sustainability and ethical behaviour.\n\n## Expected credit losses (ECL) IFRS 9\n\nThe probability-weighted estimate of credit losses (i.e., the present value of all cash shortfalls) over the expected life of a financial instrument.\n\n## Expected loss (EL)\n\nExpected loss on loans, expressed in the formula EL=PD*EAD*LGD.\n\n## Exposure at default (EAD) Basel\n\nExposure at the time of a client's default, also referred to as net exposure.\n\n## Exposure at default (EAD) IFRS 9\n\nThe exposure at default is an estimate of the exposure at a future default date, taking into account expected changes in the exposure after the reporting date, including repayments of principal and interest, whether scheduled by contract or otherwise, expected drawdowns on committed facilities, and accrued interest from missed payments.\n\n## Fair value hedges (hedge accounting)\n\nA fair value hedge comprises one or more swaps concluded to cover the changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates, of debt securities, for example. Hedge relations are typically exact hedges, involving debt securities with fixed rates and terms being offset by swaps with exactly the same terms and fixed interest rates.\n\n## Fiduciary management\n\nHolding assets as a trustee or in another fiduciary role for individuals, trusts, pension providers and other institutions. These assets are not included in the consolidated financial statements because they are not Van Lanschot Kempen's assets.\n\n## Fitch\n\nCredit rating agency.\n\n## Forbearance\n\nMaking a concession regarding the terms and conditions of a loan agreement due to actual or anticipated financial difficulties which prevent a client from meeting their obligations vis-\u00e0-vis Van Lanschot Kempen. The concession enables the client to meet the revised obligations. This may also include the whole or partial refinancing of the existing loan.",

        "page_content": "## Forwards\n\nContractual obligations to purchase or sell goods or financial assets at a future date at a pre-determined price. Forward contracts are customised contracts traded on the OTC markets.\n\n## Foundation internal ratings-based approach (F-IRB)\n\nAn advanced credit risk measurement technique. Under FIRB, a bank is allowed to develop its own models, based on direct or indirect observations, to estimate parameters for calculating risk-weighted assets. Credit risk under F-IRB is determined by using internal input for probability of default (PD). In contrast to A-IRB, the loss given default (LGD) is included, based on prescribed values.\n\n## Fund for joint account (FGR)\n\nAs part of the partnership plan, partners' individual contributions are collected in a fonds voor gemene rekening (FGR). These contributions remain in the fund during their full tenure as a partner.\n\n## Funding ratio\n\nThe ratio between public and private sector liabilities and total loans and advances (excluding bank borrowing and lending).\n\n## Futures\n\nContractual obligations to purchase or sell goods or financial assets at a future date at a pre-agreed price. Futures are standardised contracts traded on organised markets, with stock exchanges acting as intermediaries and requiring daily settlement in cash and/or deposits of collateral. Van Lanschot Kempen has a number of futures on share indices on its books, partly for its own use and partly for clients, for offsetting transactions in the markets.\n\n## General meeting\n\nThe body formed by voting shareholders and others with voting rights.\n\n## Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)\n\nAn independent organisation which develops guidelines for sustainability reports. Van Lanschot Kempen's integrated annual report is based on GRI.\n\n## Gross exposure\n\nThe value at which receivables are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position, with the exception of derivatives. Gross exposure is calculated on the basis of an add-on percentage of the nominal value (fixed percentages in accordance with the Financial Supervision Act) and the positive replacement value.\n\n## Hedge\n\nProtection of a financial position - against interest rate risks in particular - by means of a financial instrument (typically a derivative).\n\n## Impairment\n\nAmount charged to the result for possible losses on nonperforming or irrecoverable loans and advances. Alternatively, an impairment test may suggest lower asset values, if fair values have dipped below carrying amounts and/or the fair value of investments and associates have moved below cost.\n\n## Interest rate option\n\nAn agreement between a buyer and a seller, under which the seller guarantees the buyer a maximum interest rate (cap) or minimum interest rate (floor) for a fixed term.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe risk that profit and equity are impacted by changes in interest rates, in particular in the event of an intentional or unintentional mismatch in the terms of funds lent and borrowed.\n\n## Interest rate swaps\n\nA contract in which two parties exchange interest payments for a pre-agreed period and a notional principal amount, while not swapping the face value. An interest rate swap typically involves exchanging fixed-rate cash flows for floating-rate cash flows in the same currency, with the floating rate based on a benchmark interest rate (usually Euribor).\n\n## Internal capital adequacy assessment process (ICAAP)\n\nStrategies and procedures designed for Van Lanschot Kempen's continuous assessment as to whether the amount, composition and distribution of its equity still reconcile with the size and nature of its current and potential future risks.\n\n## Internal liquidity adequacy assessment process (ILAAP)\n\nA key purpose of the ILAAP is to document and demonstrate overall liquidity adequacy. This documentation informs a bank's board and regulators of the ongoing assessment and quantification of the bank's liquidity and funding risks, how the bank intends to mitigate those risks and how much current and future liquidity is required. In addition to the analysis of liquidity risk, ILAAP should also include a detailed analysis of the bank's funding profile and evaluation of risks to the stability of the funding profile.\n\n## Internal ratings-based approach (IRB)\n\nAn advanced approach used to calculate credit risk. Van Lanschot Kempen applies only the advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approach.\n\n## International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n\nAccounting and reporting standards drawn up by the International Accounting Standards Board. These standards have been adopted by the European Union and have been applied by us from the 2005 financial year.\n\n## Irrevocable commitments\n\nAll obligations resulting from irrevocable commitments that could result in loans being granted.\n\n## Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments traded in an active market is based on the price at the reporting date (market price). The bid price is applied for financial assets and the offer price for financial liabilities. Since these instruments are traded in an active market, their prices adequately reflect current and frequent market transactions between unrelated parties.\n\n## Level 2: Inputs observable in the markets\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments not traded in active markets (e.g. over-the-counter financial derivatives) is established using cash flow and option valuation models. On the basis of its estimates, Van Lanschot Kempen selects a",

Their valuation is based on management's best estimate by reference to the most recent prices, prices of similar instruments and, to a not insignificant extent, information not observable in the market.\n\n## Leverage ratio (LR)\n\nThe leverage ratio represents the relationship between total assets plus contingent items and Basel III Tier 1 capital. It is calculated in accordance with the CRR.\n\n## Lifetime probability of default (LPD)\n\nSee \"Probability of default\".\n\n## Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\n\nThe LCR represents the ratio between high-quality liquid assets and the balance of cash outflows and cash inflows in the next 30 days.\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nThe risk that the bank has insufficient liquid assets available to meet current liabilities in the short term.\n\n## Loss given default (LGD)\n\nThe loss given default is an estimate of the loss arising in the event of a default occurring at a given time. It is based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due and those that the lender would expect to receive, including from the realisation of any collateral. It is typically expressed as a percentage of EAD.\n\n## Loss given loss (LGL) model\n\nA product-level model evaluating the part of exposure at default (EAD) that may be lost.\n\n## Market risk\n\nThe risk that the value of a financial position changes due to movements in stock exchange prices, foreign exchange and/ or interest rates.\n\n## Morningstar\n\nMorningstar rates mutual funds and ETFs from 1 to 5 stars based on how well they have performed in comparison to similar funds and ETFs.\n\n## Net Promoter Score (NPS)\n\nThe NPS provides information on client loyalty and the number of promoters of the organisation. The score lies within a range of -100 to 100 points. The formula is as follows: NPS = % promoters - % detractors. Promoters give the organisation a score of 9 or 10, whereas detractors award a score of between 0 and 6.\n\n## Net stable funding ratio (NSFR)\n\nThe relationship between available stable funding and the required amount of stable funding.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nNon-controlling interests in entities that are fully consolidated by Van Lanschot Kempen.\n\n## OECD Guidelines\n\nThe OECD Guidelines describe what the Dutch government expects from multinational enterprises when it comes to corporate social responsibility. The Guidelines provide companies with guidance in the field of e.g. supply chain management, human rights, child labour, environment and corruption.\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe risk of direct or indirect losses as a result of inadequate or defective internal processes and systems, inadequate or defective human acts, or external events.\n\n## Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)\n\nThe Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) provide a framework for incorporating environmental, social and governance criteria in investment policies.\n\n## Probability of default (PD)\n\nThe probability of default is an estimate of the likelihood of default over a given time horizon. In our IRB models (Basel), this time horizon is one year. For IFRS 9 purposes, we use the one-year PD as well as the lifetime PD. A default may only happen at a certain time during the assessed period if the facility has not already been derecognised and is still in the portfolio.\n\n## Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\n\nSecurities backed by residential mortgages. A provider of residential mortgages (typically a bank) will sell these on to a separate entity, a special purpose vehicle (SPV). To finance the mortgages, the SPV will then issue securities called RMBS, which are secured by the mortgages.\n\n## Risk-weighted assets (RWA)\n\nThe assets of a financial institution after being adjusted by a weighting factor, set by its regulators, that reflects the relative risk attached to the relevant assets. Risk-weighted assets, also referred to as \"total risk exposure amount\" are used to calculate the minimum amount of capital the institution needs to hold.\n\n## Settlement risk\n\nThe risk for financial transactions that are not settled within five days of the agreed deadline if the difference between the agreed settlement price and the price at the reporting date could lead to a loss.\n\n## Shortfall\n\nThe difference between the calculated expected loss (EL) and the provision made for a loan for which the capital adequacy requirement is calculated using the IRB method. If the calculated EL exceeds the provision made, the difference must be deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital.\n\n## Solvency\n\nThe bank's buffer capital expressed as a percentage of riskweighted assets.\n\n## Standard & Poor's\n\nCredit rating agency.\n\n## Standardised approach (SA)\n\nA method used under Basel to measure operational, market and credit risks, based on a standardised approach, in which risk weightings are prescribed by the regulators.",
