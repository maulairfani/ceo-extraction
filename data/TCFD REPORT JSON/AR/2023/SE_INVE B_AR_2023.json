The shareholdings of the family bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank (today's SEB), were transferred to Investor AB, an industrial holding company spun out of the bank. Since 1917, the Wallenberg foundations have been the largest shareholder of Investor. The foundations' purpose is to contribute to the betterment of Sweden through funding of excellent research, research projects and education. By building strong and sustainable companies, thereby generating dividends, Investor plays a crucial role in this unique ecosystem.\n\nSince 1917, SEK 44bn has been awarded in grants funded by dividends from the foundations' direct and indirect holdings. The oldest and largest foundation, Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, supports free basic research that benefits Sweden. This is achieved through long-term grants to excellent scientific research and to strategic programs that foster collaboration between academia and industry.\n\nSince the turn of the millennium, the Foundation's strategic initiatives have created an extensive network focused on building competence across the interface between the scientific community and industry. This encompasses fields such as life sciences, mathematics, data, materials science, AI, and quantum technology.\n\n'The better the individual companies within Investor perform, the more dividends will go to the foundations and, ultimately, support basic research at Swedish universities. That is the essence of the Wallenberg ecosystem'\n\nPeter Wallenberg Jr, Chair Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation\n\nSEK 13.5bn dividend paid in 2023, of which\n\n3.2bn SEK\n\nto the Wallenberg Foundations\n\n<!-- image -->",

It was the warmest year ever recorded. It was also a cold year, with wars, trade tensions and other threats. At Investor, we continued to stand strong and were more focused than ever on future-proofing our companies to help them build resilience in an increasingly complex and unpredictable world.\n\nWe are in the middle of a period of continuous challenges. First, Covid-19. Then, the Russian invasion of Ukraine with all its terrible human suffering and various related supply issues. More recently, the economic challenges with galloping inflation. And a few months ago, the Middle East exploded once again, bringing more horror and uncertainty to the region - and to the world.\n\nAlongside this we continue to see more polarization. Relations between the US, China and the EU are fragile. Protectionist walls are being built. India has surpassed China as the largest country in the world in terms of population, and the number of BRICS countries has increased. This group aims to become an even stronger voice in a geopolitical context. For the first time, the Nordics is united in NATO. Meanwhile, the EU is struggling to agree on how to strengthen its competitiveness and the single market.\n\n## The impact of multiple elections\n\n2024 is certainly going to be challenging from a political view, with upcoming elections in the United States and the European Union, as well as in countries such as India and the UK. In fact, nearly half of the world's population is eligible to vote in an election this year. The outcome of some of these elections may force us to reassess\n\nour world view once more. The playing fields of today may not be relevant tomorrow as protectionism and domestic narcissism get a firmer grip in many societies.\n\nThankfully, our companies are seeing the importance of this, the importance of looking ahead, of future-proofing. They are not only striving to deliver on short-term goals and objectives but are also remarkably good at adjusting the course for the long-term, trying to anticipate what is waiting around the corner.\n\nTake sustainability as an example, where several of our companies are thriving, as they have been able to adjust to the green transition and how it is fundamentally changing society, in everything from how we produce energy, to how we manufacture and how we consume. By thinking ahead, these companies have been able to gain new, stronger market shares and positions.\n\nTake digitalization. 2023 was a year when more and more people and companies realized the direct and immediate benefits of Generative Artificial Intelligence. Many of Investor's companies are working hard on being well positioned here. They have tried out new solutions and are now seeing how new technology can\n\n<!-- image -->",

Globally, major steps are taken to govern AI and the ethical aspects are being discussed. Undoubtfully this fills an important function, but still, I encourage all our companies to have their focus weighted towards the opportunities that Generative AI represents and not be too cautious in their development.\n\n## Competitiveness crucial for our companies\n\nAt Investor, we spend a lot of our time working together internally as well as with our companies, discussing how to best prepare for the future. But it is not only companies that need to do these exercises - also countries and regions must prepare for the future to\n\nsustain or increase their competitiveness. All parts of society need to do their part. Otherwise, with European productivity dropping and investments into technology, infrastructure and energy on the decline, we will be left behind.\n\nIn 2008, 15 years ago, the EU and the US were of equal size, by GDP. Today, the US economy is 25/uni202Fpercent bigger than that of the EU and the UK - combined. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has further accelerated investments in clean energy in the US. China is also gaining speed and becoming a technology leader in sector after sector. Here, the US is its closest competitor, while the EU is painfully absent on most innovation charts.\n\nThe EU is working on its response. Initiatives such as the Green Deal, Fit for 55, and improved regulatory frameworks are steps in the right direction, although not enough. In general, there is still more focus on sticks than carrots in Europe. We are all looking forward to the findings on the EU Single Market and European competitiveness by the two former Italian Prime Ministers Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi later this year and hope they can trigger a shift in this regard.\n\n## Investor well positioned ahead of CEO succession\n\nInvestor and our companies continue to stand strong and well prepared for 2024, with strong cash flow and a very healthy balance sheet. I am pleased that the Board of Directors has proposed a dividend per share of SEK/uni202F4.80 (4.40), in line with our objective to pay a steadily rising dividend.\n\nLast year we announced that we will be changing CEO in 2024. After nine successful years as CEO, Johan Forssell will later this year hand over the baton to Christian Cederholm. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Johan for fantastic results and drive over many years. I know he could not have delivered this without a strong management team and all the very committed employees at Investor as well as the stellar performance from so many of our companies, but he deserves his own fair share of recognition. On a more personal note, I would also like to thank him for good collaboration throughout his tenure.\n\nIn 2023, the number of Investor shareholders increased to some 560 000. It is very rewarding that so many of you believe in us, but I/uni202Fam also aware that your trust comes with a big responsibility. I was therefore pleased that the Investor share last year once again was able to outperform the Swedish stock market.\n\nThank you, dear shareholders, for your continued trust and support.\n\nJacob Wallenberg Chair of the Board",

Our adjusted net asset value grew by 24/uni202Fpercent, exceeding SEK/uni202F800bn for the first time, and our total shareholder return was 26/uni202Fpercent, compared to 19/uni202Fpercent for the SIXRX return index. This was the thirteenth straight year of Investor outperforming the stock market.\n\nDear fellow shareholders, 2023 was a successful year for Investor, despite a challenging backdrop. The global economy held up relatively well, and supply chains eased. As inflation tapered off, interest rates started to fall, driving equity markets higher. At the same time, many challenges remain. We have a difficult geopolitical situation, including the devastating wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, which could also cause renewed disturbances in global supply chains. In addition, the major economies China and Germany are showing weakness, and consumers are still under pressure.\n\n## Listed Companies\n\nListed Companies' total return was 25/uni202Fpercent, outperforming the SIXRX return index by 6/uni202Fpercentage points. We participated in Sobi's rights issue to finance the acquisition of CTI Biopharma, and we divested our stake in Accelleron, previously spun out of ABB. Many of our companies took important strategic steps. ABB continued to adjust its portfolio, divesting Power Conversion, and made significant investments to meet increasing demand within electrification and automation. Epiroc announced the acquisition of STANLEY Infrastructure, strengthening its position in attractive segments within infrastructure and construction, and Electrolux Professional's acquisition of Tosei significantly expands its offering in the important Japanese market. Leveraging its innovative technology and competitive offering, Ericsson signed a strategic 5G-contract with AT&T.\n\n## Patricia Industries\n\nPatricia Industries generated a total return of 24/uni202Fpercent, driven by strong earnings growth and cash flow generation. Combined sales and EBITDA reached SEK/uni202F63bn and SEK/uni202F15bn respectively. Sales growth for the major subsidiaries was 16/uni202Fpercent, of which 9/uni202Fpercent organically in constant currency. Adjusted EBITA grew by 26/uni202Fpercent. Encouragingly, both sales and earnings growth were broad-based. In addition, cash conversion recovered strongly.\n\nOur companies proceeded with many strategic initiatives, not the least within sustainability and new technology. Several important add-on acquisitions were made, with Laborie's acquisition of Urotronic and its Optilume TM BPH product being one of the highlights.\n\n## Investments in EQT\n\nDuring 2023, the value of Investments in EQT increased by 17/uni202Fpercent, driven by the strong total shareholder return generated by EQT AB, while the value of our fund investments remained essentially flat. Despite market conditions being more challenging than in a long time, EQT successfully reached the EUR 20bn target fund size for the flagship fund EQT X, a strong testament of EQT's franchise and track record. Expecting attractive returns going forward, we will continue to invest selectively in new EQT funds.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Against this background, and in line with our strategic priority to pay a steadily rising dividend, Investor's Board of Directors proposes a 9/uni202Fpercent dividend increase compared to last year.\n\n## Going forward\n\nDuring 2023, it was announced that I will step down as CEO of Investor and that Christian Cederholm, Head of Patricia Industries, will succeed me in May. Having worked with Christian for more than 20 years, I know him as a business savvy investor with a passion for developing both companies and people. I am certain that Christian will be a great new CEO of Investor during the company's next phase.\n\nI am proud of the journey Investor has made during my nine years in office. The Investor B share has generated an annualized total return of 17/uni202Fpercent per year, well above the SIXRX return index at 10/uni202Fpercent and our own annual 8-9/uni202Fpercent return requirement.\n\nWe have gradually increased our portfolio's exposure to secular growth. This has been accomplished by divestments of companies not fitting with our strategy and by the addition of a number of highly attractive, wholly-owned subsidiaries within Patricia Industries.\n\nHowever, as always, the lion's share of the value creation is generated by our companies. The spin-out of Epiroc out of Atlas Copco, ABB:s shift out of non-core areas, redeploying resources into long-term growth areas, the successful transformation of AstraZeneca, today one of the most innovative companies in the pharmaceutical industry, and the numerous strategic add-on acquisitions by the Patricia Industries subsidiaries, are a few examples of substantial value-creation. The accomplishments of our companies and their devoted employees, and their contribution to Investor's net asset value growth, are truly amazing.\n\n'I would like to thank all the fantastic people at Investor and in our companies for your dedication and hard work, making going to work a true joy. '\n\nFurthermore, I am very pleased that we took advantage of the period when interest rates were close to zero, borrowing substantial capital at highly favorable interest rate levels and extending our maturity profile. Given this, Investor is in a very strong financial position, enabling us to weather tougher times and act on attractive investment opportunities, both on the listed and the private side.\n\nWe have also taken big leaps when it comes to future-proofing our companies through strategic initiatives, while never compromising on efficiency. For us, future proofing is about driving sustainability, embracing innovation and new technology, including AI, bringing forward competitive solutions, and building strong customer relationships.\n\nTo summarize, we have a well proven ownership model, a clear strategic direction, a portfolio of leading companies in attractive industries, and strong financials. This provides Investor with a great foundation for sustained value creation, and I am convinced that there is a lot of untapped potential still to be realized.\n\nRounding off, I would like to thank all the fantastic people at Investor and in our companies for your dedication and hard work, making going to work a true joy. It has been an absolute honor and a great pleasure to lead Investor during an exciting chapter in the company's fantastic story. I am now looking forward to focusing fully on board work in several of our world-leading industrial companies. Lastly, I would like to thank all of you, dear fellow shareholders, for your trust and support through the years!\n\nJohan Forssell President and CEO\n\n## 2023 in numbers\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAdjusted net asset value (2022: 673)\n\nSEK\n\n818bn\n\nAdjusted net asset value growth (2022: -10)\n\n24%\n\nLeverage (2022: 2)\n\n2%\n\nMarket capitalization (2022: 584)\n\nSEK\n\n713bn\n\nTotal shareholder return (2022: -15)\n\n26%\n\nProposed dividend/share (2022: 4.40)\n\nSEK 4.80\n\nCO\u2082e emissions - Investor AB\n\nCompared to 2016 (2022: -42)\n\n-82%\n\nCO\u2082e emissions - portfolio Compared to 2016 (2022: -57)\n\n-65%\n\nClimate rating, CDP score (2022: B)\n\nB\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

We work in a structured way and apply the same approach to all companies, while acknowledging that they are in different phases in different industries.\n\nThe boards of our companies, and the chair in particular, are crucial in our ownership model. We always seek board representation and strive to ensure that the boards are the best possible in terms of relevant skills and experience. Our business teams, consisting of our board representatives and investment professionals, build deep knowledge about each company, its industry dynamics and competitive landscape, with the aim to identify key strategic value drivers. Our representatives communicate these value creation plans to the companies' boards and chairs.\n\nWhile the value creation plans differ between the companies, certain focus areas run across the portfolio. Such focus areas include digitalization, including AI, sustainability, talent management and succession planning.\n\nEvaluating corporate structures continues to be high on the agenda within the portfolio. It is critical that all companies work actively with their portfolios to reduce the exposure to areas that are not strategic or will decline over time and invest in areas that will benefit from transformational trends. It is key to ensure that sufficient resources are deployed in growth areas.\n\nIn recent years, geopolitical tensions have increasingly impacted many of our portfolio companies, where the relationship between the US and China is of high importance given the size of these countries. How to successfully manage these challenges is a key topic in our dialogs with the companies.\n\n## Our network\n\nIn addition to nominating board members in our portfolio companies and driving the value creation plans that our business teams define, we contribute with our extensive network, facilitate and encourage sharing of best practice and experiences between our companies, for example through our Chairs' Circle initiative. That our portfolio consists of non-competing companies is a great advantage in this aspect.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Value creation plan\n\nThe plan varies from company to company, but typically focuses on:\n\n- \u00b7  Sustainable profitable growth\n- \u00b7  Operational excellence\n- \u00b7  Corporate structure\n- \u00b7  Agility and financial flexibility\n- \u00b7  Succession planning and talent management\n\n## Value creation through engaged ownership\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nEach company Investor is engaged in has a dedicated business team, consisting of our board representatives in the company and investment professionals at Investor.\n\nThe value creation plan is the basis for our interaction with the company's board and chair. We constantly drive the plan, follow up on progress and refine it.",

Our annual return requirement is 8-9/uni202Fpercent (risk-free interest rate plus equity market risk premium). This is achieved by delivering on our three strategic priorities: grow net asset value, pay a steadily rising dividend and deliver on our ESG targets.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Comment\n\nDuring 2023, our total shareholder return (TSR) was 26/uni202Fpercent (-15), while the SIXRX return index gained 19/uni202Fpercent (-23).

Our net asset value growth outperformed the Swedish stock market and exceeded our annual return requirement during 2023. Over the past five years, annual adjusted net asset value growth has averaged 19/uni202Fpercent.\n\n## Description\n\nOur adjusted net asset value should grow in excess of our return requirement. To achieve this, we own high-quality companies and support them to grow profitably. We also strive to allocate our capital wisely.\n\n## Strategic priorities\n\n## Comment\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes a SEK/uni202F4.80  dividend per share (4.40), to be paid in two installments, SEK 3.60 per share in May, 2024, and SEK/uni202F1.20 per share in November, 2024. Based on this proposal, our dividend has increased on average by 9/uni202Fpercent annually over the past 10 years.\n\n## Pay a steadily rising dividend\n\n## Description\n\nInvestor's dividend policy is to pay a steadily rising dividend. Our dividend policy is supported by cash flow from all three business areas: Listed Companies, Patricia Industries and Investments in EQT.\n\n## Outcome",

That is also why one of our three strategic priorities is to deliver on our ESG targets.\n\nGuided by our purpose to create value for people and society by building strong and sustainable businesses, we continue our efforts to future-proof Investor and our companies. On a global scale we are in the midst of two major transformative shifts, digitalization and sustainability, impacting all companies. We believe that our companies must invest in and further speed up their transformation to mitigate their risks and capture business opportunities from these trends.\n\nInvestor's approach is built on materiality and the most important sustainability areas are identified based on our impact, both as a company and as an owner. In our role as an owner, we make an impact through the capital we provide, our engaged ownership, our representation on the boards and through the employment, innovations, products and services delivered by our companies.\n\n'By investing in sustainability our companies create significant business opportunities.'\n\nJacob Lund, Chief Communications & Sustainability Officer\n\nThree focus areas are identified based on our impact both as a company and as an owner\n\nClimate and Resource Efficiency\n\nDiversity and Inclusion\n\nCreate business opportunities\n\nDrive better companies\n\nBusiness Ethics and Governance\n\nThe foundation of our ownership model\n\n<!-- image -->",

The business community plays a pivotal role in initiating action and devising innovative solutions to combat climate change and increase resource efficiency.\n\nto Science Based Targets when relevant. By the end of 2023, 50/uni202Fpercent of our portfolio companies have committed to setting Science Based Targets. These companies account for more than 90/uni202Fpercent of the total emissions. More broadly, 100/uni202Fpercent of the portfolio companies had aligned their climate strategies to the Paris Agreement and set measurable targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 50/uni202Fpercent or more by 2030. The companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions equaled 859,100 tonnes in 2023, a reduction of 65/uni202Fpercent compared to 2016.\n\nInvestor expects that all companies have targets to reduce emissions from their value chain (companies' scope 3). In 2023, 79/uni202Fpercent of the companies had scope 3 targets (63) and 71/uni202Fpercent of the companies had resource efficiency targets relevant to their operations (63).

We also discussed digitalization and AI with all of our companies in the value creation meetings, and it was a key topic in the Chairs' Circle.

Customers are constantly demanding more seamless digital experiences, requiring banks to invest in new capabilities and re-skilling of their teams. At the same time capital requirements and regulatory compliance demands have increased, which means higher efficiency is needed to stay at the forefront.\n\nThe bank continuously adds to its digital capabilities where recent examples include accounting service integration for the bank's SME customers, broader savings functionality in the mobile app and further digitalization of the mortgage process. Benefits are two-fold: higher customer satisfaction and time freed up for SEB's employees.\n\nA more exploratory example is the launch of SEB Embedded with the purpose to give SEB's partners a competitive edge by embedding, for instance, card payments seamlessly into their offerings without the need to apply for banking licenses or build direct connections to the payment infrastructure. This enables companies to integrate the bank's products and services into their own businesses.\n\nSEB has always been in the forefront of banking and Investor is excited to be part of its journey to create the bank of tomorrow.\n\n<!-- image -->",

Through significant minority stakes and engaged ownership, we create sustainable long-term value.\n\n## Our ownership model\n\nInvestor's listed companies are Nordic-heritaged companies with international operations, strong market positions and proven track records within engineering, healthcare, financial services and technology.\n\nWe own significant minority stakes and are typically the largest shareholder. This creates a solid base for engaged ownership and is a prerequisite for being able to influence the board composition and to impact key strategic decisions.\n\nAs an engaged owner, we typically have board representation in each company. The Chair role is important in our governance model.\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nThe total return for Listed Companies amounted to 25 percent, compared to 19 percent for the SIXRX return index. The outperformance was mainly driven by strong contributions by Atlas Copco, ABB, SEB, Saab, W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and Sobi.\n\nInvestor received SEK 12.0bn in dividends (10.9). Investor invested SEK 2.2bn in Sobi's rights issue and divested its holding in Accelleron, which was spun out of ABB in 2022, for SEK 3.6bn.\n\nOur companies continued to drive important strategic initiatives, including investments in R&D and innovation, sustainability and active portfolio management. For example, ABB divested its Power Conversion business and announced a USD 280m investment to build a new Robotics campus in Sweden, serving as a hub for the European market. Sobi acquired CTI Biopharma, broadening its\n\nproduct portfolio within prioritized areas and strengthening its US presence. Epiroc announced the strategic acquisition of STANLEY Infrastructure, strengthening its position in attractive segments within infrastructure and construction, primarily in the US. Electrolux Professional acquired Tosei, expanding its position in the important Japanese market. Leveraging its innovative technology and competitive offering, Ericsson signed a strategic USD 14bn network contract with AT&T.\n\n## Key going forward\n\nTo stay competitive in today's fast-changing environment, our companies must continue to future-proof themselves by investing in innovation, digitalization and sustainability, focusing on secular trends to drive long-term profitable growth. Developing and launching energy efficient, environmentally friendly solutions, with focus on total cost of ownership for the customers, is prioritized. It is also important that our companies continue to reduce their operational climate footprint. At the same time, they must never lose focus on efficiency in order to perform successfully, regardless of market environment.\n\nRegarding capital allocation, we continue to prioritize investments in selected portfolio companies when we find it attractive from a valuation perspective and when we are not restricted.\n\n| Adjusted net asset value         | SEK 576bn   |\n|----------------------------------|-------------|\n| Of total adjusted assets         | 69%         |\n| Number of companies              | 13          |\n| Total return 2023                | 25%         |\n| Total dividends received         | SEK 12.0bn  |\n| Invested 2023                    | SEK 2.2bn   |\n| Divested 2023                    | SEK 3.6bn   |\n| CO2e  reduction compared to 2016 | -67%        |",

Close collaboration with customers and deep insight in real customer challenges lead to products and solutions with clear value propositions to help customers meet their sustainability ambitions.\n\nAs an example, energy consumption in the products' use phase has a significant impact on cost and carbon footprint for the customers. One of Atlas Copco's most groundbreaking innovations is the Variable Speed Drive (VSD) technology in compressors. This innovative technology helps customers increase their energy efficiency which reduces carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and saves costs. Now, the VSD technology is also available in generators and pumps. Other examples include leading solutions for electric vehicle battery assembly, machine vision for quality inspection of solar panels, compressors for wastewater treatment, as well as compressors for the handling of green hydrogen.\n\nTechnology development such as increased connectivity can be used to transform the efficiency of industrial processes. An increasing share of Atlas Copco's engineers work on product development projects where software, connectivity and data analytics are integral to solving the customer's problem. Digital and data-driven services and products are becoming an increasingly important part of the product offering. As a long-term owner, we support and encourage Atlas Copco in its strategic initiatives to further build on its technology leadership.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The vision is to be a great home for great companies.\n\n## Ownership model\n\nPatricia Industries' key focus is to build wholly-owned companies in the Nordics and North America within three prioritized areas: medical technology and life science tools/reagents, industrial technology, Real estate and infrastructure. Patricia Industries has offices in Stockholm and New York, with a separate investment mandate and a specially appointed Board of Directors.\n\nWe have a long-term ownership horizon, and the aim is to exceed 90/uni202Fpercent ownership, with the companies' managements and boards of directors as co-owners, to ensure full alignment of interest.\n\nThe boards of Patricia Industries' companies are typically composed of independent directors from our network and investment professionals from Patricia Industries, led by an independent, non-executive, chair.\n\nWe look for companies with strong market positions in attractive industry niches with long-term growth. The companies should have healthy profitability and cash flow generation, and they should be agile and resilient, with strong corporate cultures.\n\n## Key highlights 2023\n\nTotal return (excluding cash) amounted to 24/uni202Fpercent. Sales growth for the major subsidiaries was 16/uni202Fpercent, of which 9/uni202Fpercent organic in constant currency. Reported EBITA grew by 28/uni202Fpercent, while EBITA, adjusted for one-off items, grew by 26/uni202Fpercent.\n\nLaborie, Piab and Permobil made strategic add-on acquisitions. In total, the subsidiaries made 10 add-on acquisitions for a total\n\nenterprise value of SEK/uni202F4.2bn. Vectura signed an agreement to divest the majority of its Community Services real estate portfolio, in line with the company's new strategic focus on development of commercial properties and innovation clusters. To support Vectura's growth journey, Patricia Industries made a capital contribution, of which the majority will be repaid in 2024. In total, Patricia Industries invested SEK/uni202F7.1bn in its portfolio companies during the year.\n\nDistributions to Patricia Industries from M\u00f6lnlycke and Permobil totaled SEK/uni202F3.8bn. Shares in Cellnex were divested for SEK/uni202F0.6bn. These proceeds strengthen Patricia Industries' capacity to invest.\n\n## Key going forward\n\nOur top priority is to support profitable growth in our existing companies. With a challenging macro environment, many companies are focused on ensuring efficiency in operations, while growing. This creates room to reinvest for the future, both in organic and non-organic initiatives. Increased digitalization, automation and sustainability, are all examples of future-proofing efforts that the companies are engaged in. In particular, we believe there are opportunities for both additional growth and efficiency improvement from leveraging new technology, including software.\n\nWhile focusing on our existing companies, we are also open to add new subsidiaries, provided we find attractive opportunities in prioritized industry segments.\n\nAdjusted net asset value\n\nSEK\n\n174bn\n\nOf total adjusted assets\n\n21%\n\nNumber of companies\n\n10\n\nTotal return 2023\n\n24%\n\nTotal distribution received\n\nSEK\n\n3.8bn\n\nInvested 2023\n\nSEK 7.1bn\n\nCO2e reduction compared to 2016\n\n-25%",

The margin was supported by volume growth as well as lower raw materials and logistics costs, offset by a negative currency impact.\n- \u00b7  Cash conversion improved sharply, mainly driven by higher earnings and improved working capital.\n- \u00b7  M\u00f6lnlycke distributed EUR 300m to Patricia Industries.\n- \u00b7  Wound Care grew 10/uni202Fpercent organically in constant currency, driven by growth in all regions. To further support growth, investments are made in the key factory in Mikkeli, Finland. In addition, investments will be made in localized China manufacturing.\n\n## Key for future value creation\n\n- \u00b7  As a leading provider of innovative, evidencebased quality products within wound management, pressure ulcer prevention and surgical solutions, M\u00f6lnlycke offers attractive long-term, profitable organic growth opportunities.\n- \u00b7  Operating Room Solutions grew 11/uni202Fpercent organic ally in constant currency, driven by volume growth, mix and price. The trays category was the main driver, partly from increased value-add in the product offering.

Growth and operating leverage also contributed positively.\n- \u00b7  Vectura signed a divestment of the majority of its Community Service portfolio to Altura (managed by NREP) for nearly SEK/uni202F5bn. The annual return on investment has been approximately 15/uni202Fpercent during Vectura's ownership. The divestment is anchored in Vectura's new strategic direction, targeting growth within commercial properties and innovation clusters such as Forskaren in Stockholm and GoCo Health Innovation City in Gothenburg. Upon closing of the divestment during the first quarter 2024, Vectura will repay the majority of the SEK/uni202F3.5bn capital contribution made by Patricia Industries in 2023. Short-term, the divestment will negatively impact margins until ongoing projects start generating revenue.\n\n## Key for future value creation\n\n- \u00b7  Vectura's ongoing focus is on developing commercial properties with a focus on innovation clusters to enable co-operation between research, academia and industry.\n- \u00b7  Key priorities for Vectura are to successfully advance ongoing developments, execute on the project pipeline and to source additional growth opportunities.\n- \u00b7  A rental agreement was signed with Saab for a 22,000m 2 new office and industrial building in Lund, expected to be completed in 2025. Patricia Industries contributed SEK/uni202F400m in funding.\n- \u00b7  A new rental agreement were signed in Forskaren with AstraZeneca and the first tenants, Elekta and Sand Clinic, gained access. New agreements were signed in GoCo House as well. The pace of leasing is in line with expectations in all projects.\n- \u00b7  During 2023, the market value of Vectura's properties increased driven by investments in ongoing projects, project completion and increased rent from indexation, partly offset by, primarily, expansion in market yields.\n- \u00b7  Vectura engaged in projects focusing on future-proofing through the use of innovative materials and process transformation. The company received environmental certification for all new buildings and continued the process to certify 100/uni202Fpercent of the existing property portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n1%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Ownership*\n\n## Financial performance\n\n## Sustainability\n\nEstimated value of holding (SEK)\n\nShare of adjusted assets\n\n*Total Exposure: 100%\n\n| Financial figures, SEK M   | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Net sales                  | 336    | 302    |\n| EBITDA                     | 227    | 178    |\n| EBITDA, %                  | 67.6   | 58.9   |\n| EBITA                      | 71     | 50     |\n| EBITA, %                   | 21.2   | 16.7   |\n| Operating cash flow        | -1,517 | -614   |\n| Net debt                   | 3,387  | 5,223  |\n| Market value of properties | 10,998 | 9,650  |\n\nChair: Johan Skoglund CEO: Joel Ambr\u00e9 Patricia Industries board representation:\n\nJenny Ashman Haquinius\n\nSales growth\n\nReported EBITDA growth\n\n11%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCO2e emission change vs 2016\n\n-33%\n\nExecutive team, females\n\n33%\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Sustainability figures                                    |   2023 | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Number of employees                                       |     47 | 49     |\n| Gender balance in the executive team,  share of females % |     33 | 57     |\n| CO2e emissions, tonnes (scope 1 and 2)                    |    404 | 430 1) |\n| Energy intensity, kWh/m\u00b2                                  |    116 | 121    |\n| Employees trained on business ethics, %                   |     90 | 82     |\n| Employee satisfaction, index   (scale 0-100)              |     75 | 78     |\n\n1) Restated compared to Annual Report 2022.",

Net cash flow to Investor amounted to SEK -0.2bn.\n\nEQT AB launched Nexus, its first strategy for individual investors, enabling access to EQT's diverse range of investments strategies through a single investment.\n\nDespite a tough fundraising environment, EQT AB successfully reached the EUR 20bn target size for EQT X.\n\n## Key going forward\n\nKey for EQT is to continue to generate attractive returns for fund investors and to continue to develop its  successful business model, built on industrial value creation.\n\nOur investments in EQT's funds have been successful over time. Net cash flow to Investor is lumpy by nature and depends on whether the funds are in an investment or exit phase. We expect continued strong net cash flow over time, and we will continue to selectively invest in future funds.\n\n'By investing in EQT funds, we get attractive exposure to asset classes, industries and geographies that we do not invest in directly ourselves.'\n\nPetra Hedengran\n\nManaging Director, General Counsel, Head of\n\nCorporate Governance and Investments in EQT\n\n## Financial performance\n\nAdjusted value\n\nSEK\n\n82bn\n\nShare of adjusted assets\n\n10%\n\nNet cash flow to Investor 2023\n\nSEK\n\n-0.2bn\n\nValue change 2023\n\n17%",

Multiple new products have been launched in recent years and the company has expanded its position in a number of attractive geographies. The acquisition of Cogentix significantly strengthened Laborie's offering within urology diagnostics and therapeutics, and by adding Clinical Innovations, a global leader in childbirth and neonatal medical products, Laborie entered an attractive new adjacency.\n\nIn 2022, Laborie acquired Optilume TM for the treatment of urethral strictures, adding an innovative, highly differentiated product with a compelling value proposition to patients and physicians into its urology offering. Laborie's strong launch execution and the product's good clinical performance have driven robust revenue growth. In 2023, Laborie acquired Optilume TM for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), entering an additional large, growing, and highly complementary urology market with significant growth potential.\n\nDuring Patricia Industries' ownership, Laborie's sales have essentially tripled, with strong underlying profitability. Patricia Industries has contributed significant equity and partnered closely with management to support Laborie's growth, working hand-in-hand on both organic and non-organic initiatives. With its inspiring mission, strong product offering, dedicated team and global reach, we see great potential for Laborie to continue its profitable growth journey in the coming years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBuilding best-in-class companies",

Risk management is therefore a continuous process in the daily business. Proactive risk management is crucial for successful governance and operations. The Board and Executive Leadership Team frequently follow up on limits and risk exposure.\n\n## Risk management\n\nThe Board is responsible for ensuring effective risk management to reach the ultimate target of generating an attractive total return. Risk management is an integral part of the Group's processes and is kept close to business operations. The Board has adopted policies with risk levels, mandates and limits for the parent company and its business areas, while the boards of the subsidiaries decide and follow up on policies that have been adapted to manage the risks in their respective businesses.\n\nRisk management is conducted continuously in the day to day business at Investor and in the portfolio companies. A comprehensive risk assessment is made annually to identify and evaluate existing and emerging risks. This assessment encompasses all categories of risks and involves the Executive Leadership Team, representatives from the whole organization as well as input from the subsidiaries. Material risks are compiled in a company-wide risk map. When needed, action plans are defined and implemented to minimize the probability and impact of identified risks. The conclusions drawn from the risk assessments are discussed and confirmed with the Board.\n\nThe CEO and Executive Leadership Team continuously follow up on the implementation of action plans and report back to the Board. Material risks that impact Investor, fall within different risk categories and are described on the following pages. These risks can individually, or in combination, have a major negative impact on the business and the ability to grow net asset value and pay a steadily rising dividend. Actions to mitigate these risks are crucial and part of the everyday business at Investor.\n\n## Uncertainty factors\n\nCommercial and financial risks are the most significant risks and uncertainty factors affecting the Group. Currently there is high uncertainty in the global economy defined by a difficult geopolitical situation, including the devastating wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, which could cause renewed disturbances in global supply chains. In addition, the major economies China and Germany are showing weakness, and consumers are still under pressure. The described uncertainties may have a material adverse impact on Investor's and the portfolio companies' business operations and financial situations and ability to deliver on the strategies.",

Currently the geopolitical situation, wars and supply chain challenges affect all businesses. Market conditions and industry dynamics change. Transactions may not be feasible at a preferred time.\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions:\n\nThe Board has set investment principles and adopted an investment policy. The overall portfolio risk is mitigated by investments in several different industries and geographies. The business teams and the Executive Leadership Team follow up continuously and report regularly to the Board on the development of the portfolio.\n\nRisk mainly relates to priority:\n\n- 1.

Being at the forefront of R&D and adapting to new technology is a prerequisite for all portfolio companies to become or remain best-inclass.\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions:\n\nInvestor's business teams constantly analyze the industries and the technology development and adapt the value creation plans. The risk is managed by continuous focus on agile and flexible business models, product development, customer needs, market analysis and cost efficiency. The value creation plans are reported to the Board. Investor's Executive Leadership Team and Board regularly discuss and follow up on the value creation plans.\n\n## Risk mainly relates to priority:\n\n- 1.  Grow net asset value\n- 4.  Engaged ownership\n- 5.  Ensure an attractive portfolio\n\n## Environmental and climate-related risk\n\n## Political and geopolitical risk\n\n## Risk:\n\nRisks related to environmental factors of our portfolio companies continue to grow in importance at the same time as regulatory activity and reporting requirements are increasing. This includes for example resource scarcity, climate change and biodiversity. Environmentally related risks have bearing on most traditional risk types, such as reputational and market risk for our portfolio companies.\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions:\n\nThe Sustainability policy is updated annually and adopted by the Board. Clear expectations are set on the portfolio companies. Measures and targets have been set to further futureproof Investor and the portfolio companies. Investor expects the portfolio companies to continue to mitigate negative environmental impact and transition to a low carbon economy, e.g. by developing and executing on climate strategies and committing to reduce emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. This work is driven through the board representatives in the individual companies including following up on companies' targets and measures to reduce their environmental impact. Investor also monitors and follows up on the portfolio companies' progress through dialog and reporting.

Share price risk is the largest. The risks that liquidity is unavailable to meet payment commitments or that financing cannot be obtained or only at increased cost due to changed market conditions, are other material financial risks.\n\n## Risk Mitigating Actions:\n\nLimits for financial risks are set in the Finance policy adopted by the Board. A measure to manage fluctuations in exchange rates and interest rates is the option to hedge by using derivative instruments. The share price risk is not hedged. Daily procedures are established to monitor, evaluate and report to the Executive Leadership Team on current exposure. Also, ensuring financial preparedness by managing the liquidity ratio, allocating loan maturities over time and diversifying sources of capital are continuous risk mitigating activities. Regular reports on exposure versus set limits are provided to the Audit and Risk Committee by Treasury and Risk Control.

New portfolio companies are evaluated in the investment process' due diligence. Investor follows up the subsidiaries on a range of areas within governance, ethics, risk and compliance, all selected based on risk assessment. Preventive measures include regular risk assessments, procedure development to mitigate risk, regular training to strengthen awareness and having whistleblowing channels implemented.

Each Investor shareholder entitled to vote may vote for the entire number of the shares owned and represented by the shareholder without restrictions to the number of votes. A-shares are entitled to one vote and B-shares are entitled to 1/10 vote.\n\nIn addition to what follows from applicable law regarding shareholders' right to participate at General Meetings, under Investor's Articles of Association shareholders must (within the time stated in the convening notice) give notice of their attendance and notify the Company of any intention to bring assistants. The documents from the AGMs and the minutes recorded at the AGMs are published on www.investorab.com.\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\nIn accordance with the instruction adopted by Investor's AGM, the members of the Nomination Committee shall be appointed by the four shareholders controlling the largest number of votes in Investor, which desire to appoint a member. In addition, the Chair of the Board shall be a member of the Committee. The Committee is obliged to perform its tasks according to the Code. The instruction for the Committee is published on www.investorab.com.\n\nThe composition of the Committee meets the requirements concerning the independence of the Committee. The AGM documents related to the Nomination Committee are published on www.investorab.com.\n\n## Nomination Committee for the 2024 AGM\n\n| Members          | Appointed by                                                | 12/31 2023, % of votes   |\n|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Leif Johansson   | Wallenberg Foundations,  Chair of the Nomination  Committee | 50.2                     |\n| Anders Oscarsson | AMF Tj\u00e4nstepension &  AMF Fonder                            | 8.3                      |\n| Magnus Carlsson  | SEB Foundation                                              | 4.9                      |\n| Peder Hasslev    | Alecta                                                      | 2.1                      |\n| Jacob Wallenberg | Chair of the Board of  Investor                             |                          |\n\n## Auditor\n\nIn accordance with its Articles of Association, Investor must have one or two auditors, and no more than two deputies. A registered firm of auditors may be appointed as Investor's auditor. The auditor is appointed by the AGM for a mandate period of one year.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM, the registered auditing company, Deloitte AB was re-elected as auditor for the period until the end of the 2024 AGM. The Authorized Public Accountant Jonas St\u00e5hlberg is since 2020 the auditor in charge for the audit. Deloitte AB has been the auditor in charge since 2013. In 2022, a thorough tender procedure was carried out for the election of auditor at the 2023 AGM. For details on fees to auditors, see note 12, Auditor's fees and expenses.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board is ultimately responsible for Investor's organization and administration.\n\nPursuant to the Articles of Association, the Board must consist of no less than three and no more than thirteen Directors, as well as no more than four deputies.\n\nAt the 2023 AGM eleven Board members and no deputies were elected. The AGM re-elected all Board members. The CEO is the only Board member employed by Investor.\n\nThe Nomination Committee applied the Code rule 4.1 as diversity policy in its nomination work. The aim is to achieve a well functioning composition of the Board when it comes to diversity and breadth, as relates to, inter alia, gender, nationality, age and industry experience. The current Board composition is the result of the work of the Nomination Committee prior to the 2023 AGM. The Nomination Committee is of the opinion that the Board has an appropriate composition and size and reflects diversity and good variety regarding qualifications and experiences within areas of strategic importance to Investor.\n\nIn respect of gender balance, excluding the CEO, 40/uni202Fpercent of the Board are females (based on ten elected members who are not employed by Investor).\n\nThe composition of Investor's Board meets the requirements concerning the independence of Directors. Several of the Board members are Directors of Investor's holdings and they receive Board compensation from these companies. This is not considered to entail a dependence of these members on Investor or its Management. Investor is an industrial holding company and works actively through the boards of its holdings to identify and\n\ndrive value-creating initiatives. The work of the Board in Investor's holdings is the core of Investor's engaged ownership model. For Investor, where a fundamental component is to have the right board in each company, it is natural that members of Investor's Board and Management have board assignments in Investor's holdings. A more detailed presentation of the Board is found on page 64 and on www.investorab.com.\n\n## Work of the Board\n\nDuring the year, the Board held 17 meetings (of which 3 per capsulam). The Board members' attendance is shown on page 64. The secretary of the Board meetings was, with a few exceptions, Investor's General Counsel, Petra Hedengran. Each Board meeting has included an item on the agenda during which the Board had the opportunity to discuss without representatives of the Management being present.\n\nThe Board has discussed, among other things, investments in EQT funds, Sobi's rights issue, the divestment of holdings in Accelleron and the implementation of CSRD (EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive), and other strategic matters.\n\nIn October, the CEO, Johan Forssell, informed that he will leave Investor, and its Board, in conjunction with the AGM on May 7, 2024, to take on a new role as an industrial advisor with a particular focus on board work in industrial companies. In December, Investor announced that the Board has decided to appoint  Christian Cederholm as new CEO, effective from the AGM on May/uni202F7, 2024.\n\nThe Board has devoted time to both internal and external presentations of the financial markets, among other things with a focus on the developments and trends of the global economy, such as climate change, sustainability and the rapid technology advances, not the least within AI. The Board has also devoted time on macro effects as a consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East, lingering inflation and the central banks' rate hikes, the uncertainty of China's post pandemic recovery as well as other geopolitical issues. The Board has discussed the development and effects on industries, markets and individual companies, paying particularly close attention to Investor's holdings and the long-term strategies of such holdings. The Board has further discussed the complex and fast moving environment and the importance of flexibility, the ability to quickly adjust and the importance of future-proofing initiatives to ensure long-term competitiveness of the portfolio companies.",

Sustainability performance and succession planning are evaluated yearly by the Board.\n\nIn addition to participating in meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee, Investor's auditor also attended a Board meeting during which Board members had the opportunity to pose questions to the auditor without representatives of the Management being present.\n\n## Board Committees\n\nIn order to increase the efficiency of its work and enable a more detailed analysis of certain issues, the Board has formed Committees. The Board Committees are the Audit and Risk Committee and the Remuneration Committee.\n\nThe members of the Committees are appointed for a maximum of one year at the statutory Board meeting.

The objective of the evaluation is to provide insight into the Board members' opinions about the performance of the Board and identify measures that could make the work of the Board more effective. In addition, the objective is to form an overview of the areas the Board believes should be afforded greater scope and where additional expertise might be needed.\n\nThe 2023 evaluation was carried out with the support by an external service for analysis and compilation. In addition, the Chair of the Board met with each Board member separately to discuss the work done by the Board during the year. The Board discussed the results of this year's evaluation and the Chair of the Board reported them to the Nomination Committee.\n\nInvestor's Board continuously evaluates the performance of the CEO by monitoring the development of the business in relation to established criteria. A formal performance review is carried out once a year.\n\n## The CEO and Executive Leadership Team\n\nThe Board appoints the CEO and approves the Instruction for the CEO. The CEO is responsible for the day to day business of Investor, for example on-going investments, employees, finance and accounting issues and regular contact with Investor's stakeholders. The CEO ensures that the Board is provided with the necessary material for making well-informed decisions.\n\nThe CEO has appointed an Executive Leadership Team to support in the management of Investor's overall business. During the year a new Chief Communications and Sustainability Officer acceded. For members of the Executive Leadership Team, see page/uni202F66.\n\n## Control functions\n\nThe Risk Control function is responsible for coordinating the internal reporting of Investor's significant risks at the aggregate level.

The Compliance and ethics function reports to the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nThe review function, Internal Control, provides objective support to the Board on matters relating to the internal control structure, partly by investigating major areas of risk and partly by performing reviews and follow-ups in selected areas. The Internal Control function regularly provides reports on its work to the Audit and Risk Committee during the year.\n\n## Remuneration\n\nCompensation to the Board\n\nThe total compensation to the Board approved by the 2023 AGM was SEK/uni202F13,325t.

Patricia Industries' Board representative provides this information to Patricia Industries' Board, where analysis and follow-up take place. Patricia Industries' Board ensures that Investor's Board and Management receive information on any issues that could affect Investor's business and external reporting.\n\nThis description of the internal control over the financial reporting is based on the framework set by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\n\n## Control environment\n\nThe control environment is built around an organization with clear decision-making channels, powers and responsibilities and a corporate culture based on shared values. It also requires each individual's awareness of his/her role in maintaining effective internal control.\n\nAll of Investor's business areas have policies, instructions and detailed process descriptions. These documents establish responsibilities for specific tasks, mandates and powers and how validation is to be carried out. Accounting and reporting rules and routines are documented in Investor's Financial Handbook.\n\nAll governing documents are presented on the intranet for all employees. The documents are updated yearly or when needed. Focus this year has been on enhancing internal steering documents related controls of sustainability reporting.\n\n## Risk assessment\n\nRisk assessment is conducted continuously in the day to day business at Investor. Annually, the Finance department and the\n\nsubsidiaries assess risk for major errors in the financial reporting and sets action plans to reduce identified risks. Focus is placed on significant Income Statement and Balance Sheet items, which have a higher risk because of volatility, complexity, or where there is a risk that the effects of a potential error may become significant because of the high transaction values involved, but also risk of errors in the non-financial data is assessed.\n\nConclusions drawn from the risk assessments on risks for errors in the financial reporting 2023 have been reported to and discussed with the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nUsing the risk assessment as a starting point to ensure the reliability of the financial reporting, the Audit and Risk Committee determines which of the identified risks should be prioritized by the Internal Control function. Suggestions for improvements are identified and implemented on an ongoing basis. For a more detailed description of risks and other risk assessments, see note/uni202F3, Risks and Risk management.\n\n## Control activities\n\nTo ensure that the financial reporting gives a true and fair picture on each reporting date, every process incorporates a number of control activities. These involve all levels of the organization, from the Board and Executive Leadership Team to other employees.\n\nFinancial controls in the company include approval of business transactions, reconciliation with external counterparties, daily monitoring of risk exposure, daily account reconciliation, monthly custody reconciliation, performance monitoring and analytical monitoring of decisions. Investor's financial reports are analyzed and validated by the company's control function within Finance. Frequent analyses of the operating subsidiaries' financial reports are also performed.\n\nInvestor's function Internal Control regularly assesses the efficiency in processes and internal controls. During 2023 focus has been on HR processes and processes for reporting of sustainability data.\n\n## Information and communication\n\nFor the purpose of ensuring that the external information is correct, complete and timely, Investor's Board has adopted a Communication Policy.\n\nWithin the company, there are also instructions regarding information security and how to communicate financial and non-financial information between the Board, Management and other employees as well as from Patricia Industries to Investor.\n\nThe Finance department is responsible for ensuring uniform application of the Group's principles and instructions for the financial reporting. Finance identifies and communicates continuously improvement areas in the financial reporting to all subsidiaries.\n\nInvestor has an established external process for whistleblowing, accessible for all employees on the intranet and for external stakeholders on www.investorab.com. It can be used anonymously. Also the subsidiaries have established whistleblowing channels that can be used anonymously.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nBoth the Board and the Executive Leadership Team regularly follow up on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls to ensure the quality of processes for the financial reporting.\n\nInvestor's financial situation and strategy regarding the company's financial position are discussed at every Board meeting and the Board is provided with detailed reports on the development of the business to this end. The Board reviews all interim reports and the annual report before public release.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee plays an important role in ensuring and monitoring that control activities are in place for important areas of risk inherent in the processes for financial reporting and regularly reports the results from the committee work to the Board.\n\nThe Audit and Risk Committee, Executive Leadership Team and the Internal Control function regularly follow up reported deviations.",

The guidelines are forward-looking, i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2020. These guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided by the general meeting as is the case with the programs for long-term variable remuneration.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nInvestor's business model is to be an engaged long-term owner. Through substantial ownership and board participation, we drive the initiatives that we believe will create the most value for each individual company. For more information regarding Investor's business model, please see www. investorab.com.\n\nA prerequisite for the successful implementation of our business strategy and safeguarding of Investor's long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that we are able to recruit and retain qualified people. To this end, it is necessary that Investor offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the President and other members of the Extended Management Group a competitive total remuneration.\n\nPrograms for long-term variable remuneration have been implemented in Investor. Such programs are resolved by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For all employees within Investor there is a Stock Matching Plan and for Senior Management there is a Performance-Based Share Program. The performance criteria used for the Performance-Based Share Program is the total return on the Investor share during a three-year period as this provides a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' long-term value creation. As from 2017, a new program was introduced for employees within Patricia Industries, meaning that employees within Patricia Industries since then are not included in Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration. The performance criteria used for the long-term variable remuneration program within Patricia Industries are related to the value growth of Patricia Industries' portfolio. This provides exposure to both value increases and value decreases within existing and future investments made by Patricia Industries. Accordingly, there is a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' longterm value creation. Both Investor's and Patricia Industries'\n\nprograms for long-term variable remuneration are conditional upon the employee's own investment in Investor shares and holding of three years. For more information regarding these programs, including the criteria on which the outcome depends, please see www.investorab.com.\n\n## Types of remuneration, etc.\n\nThe remuneration shall be competitive and in line with market conditions and may consist of the following components: Fixed cash remuneration, short-term variable remuneration, pension and other benefits. Long-term variable remuneration is also included in the total remuneration. Long-term variable remuneration is decided by the general meeting and is, as mentioned, therefore not covered by these guidelines.\n\n## Fixed cash remuneration\n\nFixed cash remuneration shall be reviewed annually and constitutes the basis for calculation of the variable remuneration.\n\n## Short-term variable remuneration\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration for the President may amount to not more than 30/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. For other members of the Extended Management Group, the short-term variable remuneration may amount to not more than 75/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFurther remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are applied on an individual basis only, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Pension\n\nPension benefits, including health insurance, shall be premium defined. Variable remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 50/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\n## Other benefits\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, medical insurance and domestic services. Such benefits may amount to not more than 20/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFor employments governed by rules other than Swedish, the components of the total remuneration may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or local practice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\n## Termination of employment\n\nUpon termination of an employment, the notice period may not exceed six months. Fixed cash remuneration during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to two years fixed cash remuneration. When termination is made by the executive, the period of notice may not exceed six months and there is no entitlement to any severance pay. In addition, any non-compete undertakings may be compensated by remuneration for loss of income (compared to the fixed cash remuneration) for a maximum of six months following the termination of employment. This is not applicable, however, when severance is paid.\n\n## Criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration, etc.\n\nShort-term variable remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability. The shortterm variable remuneration shall be dependent upon the individual's satisfaction of annually set criteria. In that way the remuneration is clearly related to the work contributions and performance of the individual. The criteria can be financial or non-financial, qualitative or quantitative, and shall be based on factors which support Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being clearly linked to value creation, engaged long-term ownership and Investor's development.\n\nThe outcome of the short-term variable remuneration is reviewed annually. To which extent the criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration have been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For the President, the short-term variable remuneration is then confirmed by the Board of Directors.\n\nInvestor shall have the possibility, under applicable law or contractual provisions, subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract, to reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).\n\n## Remuneration and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, remuneration and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken\n\ninto account by including information on the employees' total remuneration, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate. The development of the gap between the remuneration to the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.\n\n## The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for remuneration to the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the President and the other members of the Extended Management Group, the application of the guidelines for remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in Investor. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of Investor and its Management. The President and the other members of the Extended Management Group do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\n## Deviation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve Investor's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure Investor's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nFor further information on remuneration, see Investor's Annual Report and Investor's website, www.investorab.com.",

These guidelines do not apply to remuneration decided by the general meeting as is the case with the programs for long-term variable remuneration. The Board of Directors' proposal regarding guidelines for remuneration to the Annual General Meeting 2024 corresponds in substance to the guidelines decided by the Annual General Meeting 2020.\n\n## The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy, long-term interests and sustainability\n\nInvestor's business model is to be an engaged long-term owner. Through substantial ownership and board participation, we drive the initiatives that we believe will create the most value for each individual company.

The performance criteria used for the Performance Plan is the total return on the Investor share during a three-year period as this provides a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' long-term value creation. Employees within Patricia Industries have separate programs for long-term variable remuneration, meaning that employees within Patricia Industries are not included in Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration. The performance criteria used for the long-term variable remuneration program within Patricia Industries are related to the value growth of Patricia Industries' portfolio. This provides exposure to both value increases and value decreases within existing and future investments made by Patricia Industries. Accordingly, there is a clear link to Investor's business model and thus to the shareholders' long-term value creation. Both\n\nInvestor's and Patricia Industries' programs are conditional upon the employee's own investment in Investor shares and holding of three years. For more information regarding these programs, including the criteria on which the outcome depends, please see www.investorab.com.\n\n## Types of remuneration, etc.\n\nThe remuneration shall be competitive and in line with market conditions and may consist of the following components: Fixed cash remuneration, short-term variable remuneration, pension and other benefits. Long-term variable remuneration is also included in the total remuneration as a significant component. Long-term variable remuneration is decided by the general meeting and is, as mentioned, therefore not covered by these guidelines.\n\n## Fixed cash remuneration\n\nFixed cash remuneration shall be reviewed annually and constitutes the basis for calculation of the variable remuneration.\n\n## Short-term variable remuneration\n\nThe short-term variable remuneration for the President may amount to not more than 30/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. For other members of the Executive Leadership Team, the short-term variable remuneration may amount to not more than 75/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFurther remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are applied on an individual basis only, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.\n\n## Pension\n\nPension benefits, including health insurance, shall be premium defined. Variable remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 50/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\n## Other benefits\n\nOther benefits may include, for example, medical insurance and domestic services. Such benefits may amount to not more than 20/uni202Fpercent of the fixed annual cash remuneration.\n\nFor employments governed by rules other than Swedish, the components of the total remuneration may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or local prac-\n\ntice, taking into account, to the extent possible, the overall purpose of these guidelines.\n\n## Termination of employment\n\nUpon termination of an employment, the notice period may not exceed six months. Fixed cash remuneration during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to two years fixed cash remuneration. When termination is made by the executive, the period of notice may not exceed six months and there is no entitlement to any severance pay. In addition, any non-compete undertakings may be compensated by remuneration for loss of income (compared to the fixed cash remuneration) for a maximum of six months following the termination of employment. This is not applicable, however, when severance is paid.\n\n## Criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration, etc.\n\nShort-term variable remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability. The shortterm variable remuneration shall be dependent upon the individual's satisfaction of annually set criteria. In that way the remuneration is clearly related to the work contributions and performance of the individual. The criteria can be financial or non-financial, qualitative or quantitative, and shall be based on factors which support Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being clearly linked to value creation, engaged long-term ownership and Investor's development.\n\nThe outcome of the short-term variable remuneration is reviewed annually. To which extent the criteria for awarding short-term variable remuneration have been satisfied shall be evaluated when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For the President, the short-term variable remuneration is then confirmed by the Board of Directors.\n\nInvestor shall have the possibility, under applicable law or contractual provisions, subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract, to reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).\n\n## Remuneration and employment conditions for employees\n\nIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines, remuneration and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total remuneration, the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time, in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are appropriate. The development of the gap between the remuneration to the President and the other members of\n\nthe Executive Leadership Team and remuneration to other employees is disclosed in the remuneration report.\n\n## The decision-making process to determine, review and implement the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for remuneration to the President and the other members of the Executive Leadership Team. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the President and the other members of the Executive Leadership Team, the application of the guidelines for remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in Investor. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of Investor and its Management. The President and the other members of the Executive Leadership Team do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.\n\n## Deviation from the guidelines\n\nThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines, in whole or in part, if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve Investor's long-term interests, including its sustainability, or to ensure Investor's financial viability. As set out above, the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThe Board of Directors' proposal regarding guidelines for remuneration to the Annual General Meeting 2024 corresponds in substance to the guidelines decided by the Annual General Meeting 2020. A low number of comments on the guidelines for remuneration decided by the Annual General Meeting 2020 have been received, which have been compiled and reported to the Remuneration Committee. The comments refer to requests for certain specific terms and have not rendered any changes, as the proposed guidelines for remuneration are considered to appropriately promote Investor's business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability.\n\nFor further information on remuneration, see Investor's Annual Report and www.investorab.com.",

We encourage the companies to align their climate targets with the Paris Agreement, to commit to Science Based Targets when relevant and to report in accordance with recommendations from Task force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n## Investor AB's emissions\n\nInvestor AB's direct environmental impact is limited, but we take action to reduce our negative impact and carbon footprint. This includes cautious use of natural resources and energy as well as managing waste in an environmentally sound manner. Investor integrates environment and climate considerations into its business operations and risk assessments. Investor is a member of the UN Global Compact and follows its ten principles, which include the precautionary principle.\n\nTo meet our own 2030 net-zero target, Investor AB has set a climate roadmap with interim targets to break down progress into achievable short-term goals.\n\nTypically, the energy usage at our head office accounts for over 65 percent of Investor's energy consumption. To increase energy efficiency at the head office, a larger renovation is in progress during 2023 and 2024. The renovation aims to reduce energy consumption by around 30 percent, increase solar panels on the\n\nroof and the overall goal is to reach LEED Gold for manual building design and construction.\n\nThe emissions from scope 1 consist of company cars and the scope 2 emissions include purchased electricity and district heating for our offices in Stockholm, New York and Amsterdam. In 2023, the total energy consumption in our offices amounted to 737 MWh compared to 1,019 MWh in 2022. In 2023, the proportion of renewable energy was 96/uni202Fpercent (77).\n\nIn 2023, the scope 1 and 2 emissions for Investor AB equaled 22 tonnes, a reduction of 82 percent compared to 2016. The reduction compared to 2016 is mainly due to energy efficiency and increased share of renewable energy.\n\nIn 2023, emissions from business travel increased compared to the previous year and is currently back at pre-pandemic levels. We have moved to a 'train first' travel policy when relevant and we are also promoting the use of digital meeting technologies. Other non-travel related proposals include for example extending life and usage of purchased IT equipment.\n\n| Emissions, tonnes CO2e           | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   | 2016  base year   |\n|----------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------------|\n| Scope 1                          | 11     | 11     | 11     | 22                |\n| Scope 2 market based  method     | 11     | 66 2)  | 66     | 96                |\n| (Scope 2 location based  method) | (123)  | (85)   | (81)   | (112)             |\n| Investor's   scope 1 and 2 1)    | 22     | 77     | 77     | 118               |\n\n| Scope 3 emissions, tonnes CO2e 1)             | 2023    | 2022    |\n|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| 1.

It is Investor's ambition to reduce the portfolio's carbon footprint by encouraging companies to reduce their carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. Investor aims to strengthen the portfolio's resilience and has committed to reduce absolute GHG emissions from portfolio companies by 70 percent between 2016 and 2030.\n\nThe target includes the portfolio companies' total scope 1 and 2 emissions and is set for the overall portfolio (not an equity approach). Investor has set targets on the total level in order to contribute to an actual reduction of carbon emissions. The baseline is 2016 as it was the first year we measured the companies' emissions and aligned with the Agenda 2030. The emissions from portfolio companies' exclude Financial Investments and EQT AB funds.\n\nThe companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions equaled 859,100 tonnes in 2023, a reduction of 65/uni202Fpercent compared to 2016. Investor works through its representation on the boards to drive the companies to set targets and strategies to develop resource efficient processes and to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, we encourage the integration of climate in our companies' value creation plans.\n\n| Emissions, tonnes CO2e 1)   | 2023    | 2022      | 2021      | 2016  base year   |\n|-----------------------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|\n| Listed Companies            | 758,900 | 946,700   | 1,202,900 | 2,302,000         |\n| Patricia Industries         | 99,800  | 107,300   | 141,600   | 132,300           |\n| EQT AB                      | 400     | 400       | 300       | 400               |\n| Portfolio emissions         | 859,100 | 1,054,400 | 1,344,800 | 2,434,700         |\n\n1) Emissions from our portfolio companies' total scope 1 and 2 emissions. The figures for emissions have been restated compared to Annual Report 2022 due to updated data from portfolio companies.\n\nBy the end of 2023, 50 percent of our portfolio companies have committed to setting Science Based Targets (50). The portfolio companies with reduction targets that have been approved by the SBTi make up more than 90/uni202Fpercent of total emissions. More broadly, 100 percent of the portfolio companies had aligned their climate strategies to the Paris Agreement and set measurable targets to decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 50 percent or more by 2030.\n\nEmissions in relation to revenue, tonnes of CO2e/SEK m.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe reduction of emissions is both in absolute terms and in relation to revenues, i.e. decoupling (lower carbon impact and higher revenues and economic results). The diagram shows the emissions from the portfolio in relation to the revenue from the portfolio companies.\n\nA milestone for 2023 was to ensure that all portfolio companies within Patricia Industries have action plans for reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. The main focus has been to reduce absolute emissions by increasing energy efficiency and in addition increase the utilization of renewable energy.\n\n## Portfolio approach: companies' scope 3 emissions\n\nInvestor has set an additional portfolio target to ensure that all of our companies have relevant reduction targets for their scope 3 emissions. The portfolio companies' scope 3 emissions are material. It is challenging to set an overall reduction target due to the complexity of the different business models and industries. Investor has therefore set this target to ensure that all our companies integrate climate into their business strategies where it is most relevant to them, while also ensuring that emissions upstream and downstream in the value chain are taken into consideration.\n\nIn 2023, 92 percent of our companies measured scope 3 emissions (83) and 79 percent had reduction targets related to their products, services or value chain (63). This is an increase compared to 2020 when 43 percent of the companies had reduction targets for scope 3 emissions. A milestone for 2023 was to ensure all companies within Patricia Industries conducted a scope 3 screening. By the end of 2030, 80 percent of the companies within Patricia Industries had conducted a scope 3 screening. High priority is to ensure all companies screen and measure relevant scope 3 emissions and set targets.\n\n| Portfolio companies' indirect emissions                         | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Share of our companies that measure   scope 3 emissions         | 92%    | 83%    |\n| Share of our companies that have   reduction target for scope 3 | 79%    | 63%    |\n| Share of our companies that have   resource  efficiency targets | 71%    | 63% 1) |\n\n1) Restated compared to Annual Report 2022 due to updated data from portfolio companies.\n\nIn 2023, 71 percent of our companies had targets regarding resource efficiency (63). Many of our portfolio companies are sustainability leaders and have over many years developed products demanded by customers who require resource efficient solutions. The future success of our companies depends on their capacity to drive change and to invest for the long-term in new solutions that are more resource efficient and that meet the needs of their customers. We therefore monitor the companies' investments in research and development (R&D). In 2023, R&D expenses in our companies totaled SEK/uni202F207 bn.\n\nAt Investor, climate-related issues are monitored continuously and once a year a more comprehensive analysis is conducted on all portfolio companies. As an owner we assess our portfolio's overall exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities. All portfolio companies report their yearly sustainability performance to Investor. The collection of information is both through a sustainability reporting system and through follow-up dialog with each company. Climate calculations and analyses are performed for Investor's portfolio companies in order to identify companies' fossil fuel dependency and negative trends for carbon emissions.\n\nInvestor monitors and follows our companies progress through dialog and reporting. An overview of the portfolio companies' performance is presented to Investor's Board of Directors yearly. Investor develops individual value creation plans for each portfolio company and drives the climate strategy through our board representation in the individual companies.\n\nThe business teams and sustainability team engage with our portfolio companies on a regular basis. Investor follows-up with the companies each year regarding water consumption, waste and greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n## Reporting principles\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are reported in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard. Activity data includes, but is not limited to, purchasing data and internal tracking controls. Where data has been unavailable - estimates have been used. All GHG emissions are calculated in metric tonnes and converted to metric tonnes of CO2 equivalents (or 'CO2e') using the global warming potentials. Definitions are presented on page 164. The totals in the tables may not precisely match the totals due to rounding.\n\nMore detailed information, risks and opportunities and description of emission factors are found in Investor AB's separate TCFD Report available on the webpage.",

Diverse and inclusive teams stimulate innovation and drive better decision-making.\n\n## Investor\n\nOur Diversity and Inclusion Policy is part of our Sustainability Policy, approved by the Board of Directors and includes diversity and inclusion targets. Our approach and procedures are summarized in the Diversity and Inclusion Plan, which is approved by Investor's Executive Leadership Team and aimed at providing guidance on how to embrace inclusion and diversity and execute on the policy as a company.\n\nOur aspiration is that all employees are encouraged and comfortable to express opinions and constructive ideas. We aim for our employees to feel a sense of belonging and feel valued as individuals. To create a workplace and a culture that is inclusive and free from discrimination, we focus on six areas: working conditions, professional development, work and parenthood, recruitment, remuneration and zero-tolerance against harassment and discrimination.\n\nA Diversity and Inclusion group, made up of employee representatives and representatives from the Executive Leadership Team, actively collaborate on initiatives to further strengthen diversity and inclusion within Investor.\n\nWe are convinced that making use of the total available talent pool builds stronger and more dynamic teams and we strive to expand our recruitment pool. It is our ambition to contribute to a meritocratic business community free from unconscious bias. When it comes to equal pay, we conduct an annual salary evaluation to ensure that we provide equal compensation for the same competence and responsibility, regardless of gender. Investor mirrors the collective bargaining agreement for the banking community and offers our employees the same or better benefits.\n\nInvestor's target is a gender balance of 40/60 in the Executive Leadership Team by 2030, meaning at least 40 percent of the underrepresented gender. In 2023, the proportion of females in Investor's Executive Leadership Team was 43 percent and 54 percent in the overall organization. At the end of 2023, the number of employees was 100 (headcount). Investor is diversified in terms of age, gender and expertise.

The surveys in 2023 came out with strong results versus the external benchmark. The employee Net Promoter Score was 72 (69) and the engagement score was top 5 percent of a global finance benchmark (5). There are strong results in the confidence of the business strategy and related to positive and good peer-relationships.\n\nInvestor measures perceived level of inclusion among our employees as well as the ability as individuals to make an impact and contribute to the overall strategy. In 2023, employees reported a high level of inclusion compared to external benchmark, scoring on average 8.7 (scale 1-10). On belonging and on feeling valued, the scores were 8.6 and 8.7.\n\n| Employee survey 1)                                   |   2023 |   2022 |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Employee Inclusion average score (scale 1-10)        |    8.7 |    8.8 |\n| Employee Diversity average score (scale 1-10)        |    7.6 |    7.7 |\n| Employee Engagement average score (scale 1-10)       |    8.8 |    8.7 |\n| Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS scale -100 to 100) |   72   |   69   |\n\n| Employee Data 1)  December 31   | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Number of employees             | 100    | 95     | 96     |\n| Personnel turnover 2)           | 7%     | 7%     | 2%     |\n| Average sick leave 3)           | 0.9%   | 1.0%   | 0.4%   |\n\n|                                | 2023   | 2023   | 2022   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Employee turnover 1)           | Female | Men    | Female | Men    |\n| Number of new employee hires   | 9      | 5      | 3      | 3      |\n| Rate of new employee hires     | 9%     | 5%     | 3%     | 3%     |\n| Number of employee turnover 2) | 3      | 4      | 3      | 3      |\n| Rate of employee turnover      | 6%     | 9%     | 7%     | 7%     |\n\n|                                           | 2023   | 2023   | 2022  5)   | 2022  5)   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|--------|------------|------------|\n| Parental leave 1)                         | Female | Men    | Female     | Men        |\n| Average time on parental leave,  weeks 4) | 14     | 11     | 8          | 7          |",

These employees' work tends to be project-based or in support of daily processes. In 2023 there was one compared to two in 2022.\n\n## Portfolio approach\n\nInvestor encourages the portfolio companies to actively promote diversity and inclusion and has set diversity and inclusion targets for our portfolio. Investor drives diversity in its portfolio companies through the nomination committees and board representation.\n\nThe first target is to ensure that all portfolio companies measure the perceived level of inclusion among employees on a regular basis. The second target is to reach a gender balance of 40/60 in the portfolio companies' board of directors and executive teams from an overall portfolio perspective by 2030.\n\nOur portfolio companies report progress yearly on the basis of voluntary and self-reported data. In 2023, all companies reported that they have policies covering diversity and anti-discrimination and 96 percent of our companies have a commitment or target related to diversity, mainly focused on gender (96). 96 percent of our companies measured the perceived level of inclusion among employees (92).\n\nThe average proportion of females in the companies' executive teams amounts to 30 percent (28). The average age is 53 and there are 25 nationalities represented. The five most common nationalities are Swedish, American, British, Danish and Finnish. Among the Swedish portfolio companies, the executive teams have on average 41 percent Non-Swedish members.\n\n| Portfolio executive teams, female        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Listed Companies                         | 27.7%  | 23.3%  | 21.0%  |\n| Patricia Industries                      | 32.5%  | 33.6%  | 33.2%  |\n| EQT AB                                   | 33.3%  | 27.3%  | 12.5%  |\n| Average share of female                  | 29.9%  | 27.8%  | 25.7%  |\n| Portfolio executive teams, nationalities | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n| Listed Companies                         | 22     | 22     | 22     |\n| Patricia Industries                      | 13     | 12     | 12     |\n| EQT AB                                   | 7      | 7      | 5      |\n| Total number of different nationalities  | 25     | 24     | 23     |\n\nInvestor works with succession planning for strategic positions and has during the last years worked actively with broaden the network and developed a diverse candidate pool for recruitment. We are working to increase the number of female candidates in the candidate pool.\n\nParticipating in nomination committees, in order to compose the best possible board for each company, is one of Investor's most important tasks as an owner. Investor is represented in eleven nomination committees in listed companies. In seven of these, Investor has female representation.\n\nThe average proportion of females on the companies' boards of directors amounts to 37 percent (33). The average age is 57 and there are 15 nationalities represented. The most common nationalities are Swedish, American, British, Canadian and Danish. Among the Swedish portfolio companies, the boards of directors have on average 35 percent Non-Swedish members.\n\n| Portfolio Board of Directors, female        | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Listed Companies                            | 39.9%  | 37.6%  | 38.8%  |\n| Patricia Industries                         | 35.0%  | 25.5%  | 26.0%  |\n| EQT AB                                      | 28.6%  | 37.5%  | 50.0%  |\n| Average share of female                     | 37.4%  | 32.5%  | 34.0%  |\n| Portfolio Board of Directors, nationalities | 2023   | 2022   | 2021   |\n| Listed Companies                            | 14     | 15     | 14     |\n| Patricia Industries                         | 9      | 8      | 8      |\n| EQT AB                                      | 4      | 5      | 4      |\n| Total number of different nationalities     | 15     | 16     | 15     |\n\nIn the reported diversity data, executive directors are excluded from the Board of Directors (e. g., CEO) to prevent double counting as they are included in the executive teams.",

Business ethics and governance is the foundation for Investor's ownership model and sustainability approach.\n\n## Policy framework and approach\n\nInvestor's Board of Directors has decided on a policy framework and Code of Conduct that sets the principles for how Investor should act as a responsible owner and company. The Code of Conduct and other documents in the policy framework address topics such as sustainability, human rights, anti-corruption and whistleblowing. The Code of Conduct is based on our values and policies and applies to all employees, the Boards of Directors and company representatives. In 2023, all employees have participated in Code of Conduct training and signed the Code of Conduct which also includes the anti-bribery and anti-corruption policy.\n\nInvestor has zero tolerance for corruption and bribery. The risk for bribery and corruption is evaluated continuously and also assessed on an annual basis as part of Investor's risk assessment process. We have internal procedures approved by the Executive Leadership Team, aimed at providing guidance to evaluate what is appropriate and not appropriate in professional relations regarding, among other things, gifts and benefits. Gifts and benefits given and received shall always be characterized by openness and moderation. In doubtful situations, the immediate manager shall always be informed and consulted. Investor's Legal department is also available for guidance. We hold regular trainings, and all policies and procedures are available on Investor's intranet. In 2023, all employees at Investor participated in anti-corruption and anti-bribery training.\n\n## Report concerns and whistleblowing\n\nWe strive to maintain a transparent business climate and high business ethics and we value the safety and respect of everyone affected by our business. Employees should in the first instance turn to their immediate manager, any member of the Executive Leadership Team or HR with issues and concerns. Other stakeholders, such as our shareholders, can bring up questions, issues and concerns via the webpage where contact details are available. Any concerns or incidents are investigated and documented according to established investigation routines. Material incidents are reported to the Executive Leadership Team and the Board and corrective actions are taken. Through our whistleblowing system, both employees and other external stakeholders can also report suspected violations of law or business ethics. The whistleblowing procedure is prepared and managed by Compliance and approved by Investor's Executive Leadership Team. The purpose of the whistleblowing channel is to encourage employees and other\n\nstakeholders to blow the whistle on suspected misconduct without any risk of retaliation, as well as to ensure an appropriate investigation process. The function of the system is evaluated yearly and updates are implemented. Reports are handled confidentially by representatives at Investor's Legal department. Access to messages received through the channel is restricted. Representatives from the Legal department decide if and how a whistleblowing report should be escalated based on established investigation procedures. A summary of received reports is presented to the Board on an annual basis. In 2023, Investor received three reports through the whistleblowing channel, all were related to concerns in our portfolio companies (7). All reports have been processed and managed in accordance with set investigations procedures. There has been no incidents at Investor relating to bribery, corruption and other fines or sanctions during 2023 (0).\n\n## Portfolio approach\n\nInvestor's Sustainability Guidelines set expectations for our portfolio companies to conduct their operations in a responsible and ethical manner (see page 23). Our companies are expected to adhere to Investor's Sustainability Guidelines. They require, among other things, that our portfolio companies have adequate policies, processes and resources to manage and monitor business ethics, and that they have secure whistleblowing systems in place. Reports shall be managed in accordance with established investigation procedures, escalated to relevant governance body and any corrective action should be taken.\n\nInvestor has initiated a structured Governance, Risk and Compliance program to follow up and improve risk awareness, maturity, and governance structures among the portfolio companies. The program covers areas that are selected based on a risk assessment and include areas such as ethical business conduct, whistleblowing, anti-corruption and anti-bribery. The program includes awareness initiatives, maturity assessments and deep dive reviews. Investor uses a risk-based approach when assessing the maturity of the subsidiaries' work within the selected areas. In addition to the overall maturity assessment a focus area is selected each year for deeper reviews.\n\nIn 2023 the focus area was the companies' governance, processes and quality in sustainability reporting. The reviews were conducted together with our auditor. Representatives from all wholly-owned companies participated in an awareness training followed by a review of their maturity and quality in sustainability reporting.\n\nDialogs were also held with all listed companies about governance and processes around sustainability reporting. Based on reviews and dialogs, it is concluded that all companies have an active approach to continuously develop their processes to increase quality. Formalization of the reporting processes and internal controls are examples that some companies have identified to further enhance.\n\nTo raise awareness of ethical and compliance risks within our companies and to ensure efficient management of potential incidents, Investor has launched an awareness program. This program focuses on key risk and compliance areas for board representatives and our Investment organization. In 2023 areas in focus have been Competition law, Anti-bribery and Anti-corruption.\n\nInvestor continuously monitors the portfolio companies' development and progress. Both through reviews, dialogs and the annual sustainability selfassessment questionnaire.\n\nThe business teams within Investor develop value creation plans for each portfolio company which include business ethics and sustainability. Progress within the companies regarding business ethics and the sustainability guidelines are monitored regularly and if a serious sustainability related issue occurs in one of our companies, the business team is responsible for raising the matter. If misconduct or lack of business ethics is discovered, Investor expects that the Board and Management take action and ensure that the company's compliance efforts are adequate. Investor's business team monitors the steps taken.",

The content is mainly found on pages 19-23, 38-49, 54-56 and in this supplement on pages 71-87. The report has been prepared in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021, as well as the disclosure requirements set out in the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Compared with the consolidated financial reporting, Investor's portfolio of financial investments are not in scope with respect to the sustainability reporting.\n\nThe sustainability reporting focus on Investor AB and includes material information related to the portfolio of the business areas; Listed Companies, Patricia Industries and Investments in EQT. The report has been limited assured by our auditors, Deloitte.\n\nIn 2023, the number of major portfolio companies decreased by one, from 25 to 24 compared to 2022. Listed Companies divested Accelleron, an earlier spin-off from ABB. The divestment was completed in the third quarter 2023 and is therefore not included in the sustainability key performance indicators for 2023. The wholly-owned subsidiaries have sustainability sections on pages 38-48 and on 79-80. The listed companies and a number of the companies within Patricia Industries also publish their own sustainability reports.\n\nOur sustainability work is also disclosed on our website where our Sustainability Policy, Code of Conduct, guiding principle on tax, Diversity and inclusion plan, TCFD report and whistleblowing procedures are available. A mapping of Investor's existing sustainability reporting with references to SASB metrics is also available on our webpage. Investor reports its Communication of Progress to the UN Global Compact and climate data to CDP.\n\nRestatement of information is communicated in connection to where data is presented in this section of the report. The principles for restatements of climate related data are found in the Recalculation Principles on Investor webpage.\n\nGRI Standards requires reporting on omissions. One omission relates to disclosure GRI 2-21 Annual total compensation ratio which is reported in the Remuneration Report 2023 where the amounts are reported in absolute figures rather than as a ratio. Otherwise throughout this report omissions of information are presented alongside the associated GRI disclosure, for example as a footnote to an information table.\n\n## Governance and approach\n\nInvestor's Board of Directors has decided on a policy framework that sets the principles for how Investor should act as a responsible owner and company. The policies are reviewed and approved on an annual basis. The Board of Directors is responsible for Investor's overall strategy, including the approach to integrate sustainability aspects as part of our value creation. It is the overall Board of Directors that are responsible for overseeing the management of the organization's impacts on the economy, environment and people. The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for Investor's organization and administration and signs off on the reported sustainability information.\n\nThe CEO has overall responsibility for Investor's business strategy including for example climate-related issues and business ethics. The Executive Leadership Team decides on the development and execution of the sustainability approach. The managerial responsibility for responsible investments lies within the investment organization. The Heads of Listed Companies and Patricia Industries are responsible for integrating sustainability into the investment and ownership strategies, including risk assessment, due diligence, continuous monitoring and follow-up. Investor's board representative together with the business teams engage with the companies at least yearly regarding sustainability. Investor also has a dedicated sustainability team that together with the business teams drive specific sustainability related projects across all three focus areas. All employees within Investor have a responsibility to work in line with the overall sustainability strategy. Investor conducts sustainability training and awareness sessions for employees regularly and at least yearly. All new employees take part in Investor's onboarding program, where Investor's sustainability strategy and focus areas are presented.\n\nThe remuneration policies are indirectly related to sustainability objectives and performance. Sustainability is one of Investor's three strategic priorities. During the annual review when performance is assessed for the CEO, Executive Leadership Team and managers, one factor considered is whether and how Investor is delivering on its strategic priorities.\n\n## Board of Director oversight\n\nThe senior executives report to the Board of Directors on the management and report progress continuously when relevant topics arise. Each board meeting contains a regulatory update and at least yearly a more comprehensive presentation on changes to the regulatory landscape is presented. At least once a year the Board receives a more detailed update on how Investor delivers on its sustainability targets. The investment organization also presents recent sustainability performance of the portfolio companies as a part of the deep-dive into each portfolio company.\n\nOn a regular basis, CEO's from Investor's portfolio companies are invited to meet with the Board of Directors to present the company strategy and performance, which includes sustainability. In 2023 the Board of Directors visited three portfolio companies with a focus on their sustainability approach and performance. In the yearly board evaluation, the board assesses how ESG matters are incorporated into the meeting agenda, that they have sufficient information about the most important issues and how to determine the sustainability activities that provides most value add to the business.\n\n## Conflicts of interest\n\nInvestor maintains rules regarding conflicts of interest. Directors are not participating in discussions or decisions of a matter where the Director has an interest which is not aligned with the interests of Investor or its shareholders.\n\n## Stakeholder engagement\n\nInvestor continuously monitors its most significant economic, environmental and social impacts to ensure that Investor addresses the most important issues to its stakeholders. Key stakeholder groups have been identified based on their interest and potential impact from and on Investor's operations.\n\nInvestor's most significant sustainability topics have been identified and prioritized via ongoing engagements, dialogs, group meetings, and interviews with stakeholders through different channels and methods. Most of them are integrated in our regular work through for example ongoing dialog with investors, analysts, employees, suppliers and partners.",

The stakeholders raised the importance of Investor encouraging the portfolio companies to create sustainable business models and work in a sustainable way. All of our stakeholders stress the importance of active governance of sustainability issues both as a company and as an owner in order to secure Investor's long-term attractiveness as an investment.\n\nThe results from different stakeholders showed great similarities when it comes to what was most valued. Topics that have been raised by our key stakeholders are governance, business ethics, anti-corruption, climate and diversity. All stakeholders considered these topics to be very important. The results from the stakeholder dialog were used when setting Investor's sustainability approach and focus areas.\n\nThere have been no change related to the material topics during the year. Investor has conducted a double materiality assessment during 2023 that will be finalized early 2024. The result from the assessment will form the basis for the sustainability reporting in accordance with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).\n\n| Material topic                    | Boundary and impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Business   Ethics and  Governance | Impact within and outside the organization. Ethical business  conduct is the foundation for our and our portfolio companies'  long-term success. The information regarding the material  topic covers Investor AB and aggregated data for our portfolio  companies.                                    |\n| Diversity and  Inclusion          | Impact within and outside the organization. Investor views  both diversity and inclusion as business imperatives and  believes the value that is created benefits society at large. The  information regarding the material topic covers Investor AB  and aggregated data for our portfolio companies. |\n| Climate and  Resource  Efficiency | Impact mainly outside the organization. Small direct impact  from Investor AB and main impact is indirect through the  operations of our portfolio companies. Investor reports scope  1, 2 and 3 emissions. Our scope 3 emissions includes our  portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2 emissions.          |\n\n## Policy and strategic documents\n\nThe Sustainability Policy sets the framework for Investor's sustainability approach and work.\n\n| Areas                                        | Policy and strategic documents                                                                                                                                                |\n|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Compliance with laws  and business ethics    | \u00b7  Code of Conduct \u00b7  Sustainability Policy (incl.

Investor is also a member in Sida's Swedish Investors for Sustainable Development with the aim of developing more efficient performance indicators and processes to measure development of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Cross-sector collaboration between civil society, academia and the business community is key to achieve these goals.\n\nInvestor is committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and has identified six of the SDGs where we as an owner can contribute the most and where we are also mostly impacted.\n\nInvestor aims to continuously generate sustainable, economic value and simultaneously have a positive impact on society and the environment, thus creating shared value. In 2023, our total paid dividend amounted to SEK/uni202F13.5 bn, whereof approx. SEK/uni202F3.2bn, was distributed to our lead owners, the Wallenberg Foundations, whose purpose is the betterment of Sweden through granting funding to scientific research. Investor strives to be a good corporate citizen and also supports organizations such as Beredskapslyftet, IVA, SNS, Chambers of Commerce, Business Challenge and Young Enterprise Sweden. The areas we prioritize are youth, education and entrepreneurship.\n\n## Value chain and procurement\n\nIt is in our role as an owner of portfolio companies that we make our largest impact. This is through the capital we provide, our engaged ownership and our representation on the/uni202Fboards.\n\nThere have been no material changes to the value chain during 2023. As an industrial holding company, our supply chain is neither extensive nor complex. The primary suppliers are office, software and hardware providers, consultancies and travel agents. In 2023, a risk assessment was conducted to categorize the suppliers into three different categories. Our own analysis shows limited sustainability related risks in our supply chain. Suppliers are primarily active in Nordic countries and there have been no major changes of suppliers during 2023.\n\nBased on the result from the risk categorization, Investor conducted specific dialogs during 2023 with suppliers related to offices (landlord and cleaning services), hardware providers and consultancies. Investor requires its suppliers to comply with principles set forth in the Supplier Code of Conduct. Investor's Supplier Code of Conduct sets the principles for how we expect our suppliers to behave with regards to their ethical, social and environmental business practice.\n\nThis year additional disclosures are provided on workers who are not employees. There are some individuals such as contractors or consultants hired through a consultant agency who are workers and not categorized as employees. They commonly work on specific fixed-term projects where expertise is to be supplemented within the team. In 2023 there were 21 such workers (28).\n\nInvestor has a procurement process that defines roles and responsibilities when evaluating suppliers and products. Among other things suppliers and products should be evaluated in relation to quality, price, information security, business ethics, climate and human rights. There are regular follow-ups with suppliers, mostly through dialogs and assessments.\n\nEach subsidiary sets its own procedures for evaluation and audits of its suppliers. Where action is taken in the year that materially improves those procedures, this is disclosed in further detail in the following company specific information pages.\n\n## UN Sustainable Development Goals\n\nInvestor is committed to the UN Sustainable Development Goals and contributes to a number of them.

All turnover, CapEx, and OpEx that were provided in an alternative currency, have been converted to SEK.\n\n## Turnover\n\nTotal turnover corresponds to Net sales in the Consolidated income statement in the Financial Report on page 96. More information about net sales and the revenue from the sale of products and services within the Group can be found in note 7, Revenues in the Annual Report.\n\n## Capital expenditures\n\nTotal CapEx corresponds to additions to tangible and intangible assets, including tangible and intangible assets resulting from business combinations and right-ofuse assets. Goodwill arising from business combinations has been excluded. The total CapEx equals the additions as specified in note 16, Intangible assets, note 17, Buildings and land, note 18, Investment Property and note 19, Machinery and Equipment. The applicable rows in note 16, are Business combinations (except Goodwill), Internally generated intangible assets and Acquisitions. In note 17, 18 and 19, the applicable rows are Business combinations and Other acquisitions.\n\n## Operating expenditures\n\nTotal OpEx corresponds to non-capitalized research and development costs, building renovation costs, short-term leases, maintenance, and repair costs and other indirect costs for the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant, and equipment.\n\n## Share of eligible turnover, CapEx and OpEx\n\nTurnover, CapEx and OpEx in accordance with the above definitions and associated with eligible activities constitute the basis for calculating the share of eligible turnover, CapEx and OpEx.\n\n## Assessment of eligibility and alignment\n\nInvestor has assessed its economic activities in relation to the EU taxonomy regulation. Eligibility is calculated for all six environmental objectives, while alignment is considered for the first two objectives Climate Change Mitigation\n\n(CCM) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA). This is because of an update in the EU taxonomy this year with four new environmental objectives: Sustainable Use and Protection of Water and Marine Resources (WTR), Transition to a Circular Economy (CE), Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) and Protection and Restoration of Biodiversity and Ecosystems (BIO).\n\n## Eligible economic activities\n\nEach wholly-owned company has identified its relevant sector and economic activities. The most relevant sectors for these portfolio companies are manufacturing, transport and construction and real estate. Each company assessed their economic activities in relation to the taxonomy to identify eligibility. The majority of our companies' economic activities are not currently covered by the EU taxonomy regulation. Eight of the wholly owned companies in the above sectors have identified activities that are eligible under the EU taxonomy.\n\nThe following activities are eligible for our companies:\n\n- \u00b7 CCM 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport is eligible for Permobil and BraunAbility given the manufacturing of transporting vehicles, electric wheelchairs and wheelchair accessible vans.\n- \u00b7 CCM 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility components, is eligible for BraunAbility due to the company's production of components for vans.\n- \u00b7 CCM 7.1. Construction of new buildings is eligible for Vectura as the company is in the construction and real estate industry.\n- \u00b7 CE 1.2 Manufacture of electrical and electronic equipment is eligible for Advanced Instruments, Piab, Laborie and BraunAbility, all of which manufacture or are owners of electrical products.\n- \u00b7 CE 5.2 Sale of spare parts is eligible for Permobil, given the manufacturing of spare parts for wheelchairs.\n- \u00b7 CCM 7.7. Acquisition and ownership of buildings is mainly eligible for Vectura's turnover as the company is in the real estate industry. The economic activity is also CapEx eligible for M\u00f6lnlycke, Sarnova, Laborie and BraunAbility, either for newly signed leasing contracts or for investments related to owned buildings.\n- \u00b7 CCM 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings is mainly eligible for Vectura's turnover as the company is in the real estate industry. The economic activity is also CapEx eligible for BraunAbility that has minor investments.\n- \u00b7 PPC 1.2 Manufacture of medicinal preparations is eligible for M\u00f6lnlycke, as some products contain pharmaceutical preparations.\n- \u00b7 CE 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing is eligible for BraunAbility, given its business includes renewing older vans.\n- \u00b7 CCM 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles is eligible for leasing of cars for Permobil, Piab and BraunAbility.\n\n- \u00b7 CCM 7.3, 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 relates to energy efficiency measures and renewable energy which is eligible for several companies, although the total eligibility is less than 0.5 percent.\n\nAs Vectura, BraunAbility and Permobil has the highest share of eligibility, a more detailed explanation of their economic activities follows.\n\n- \u00b7 Vectura is in the Construction and Real Estate industry and has mapped six activities CCM 7.1 Construction of new buildings, 7.2 Renovation of existing buildings, 7.3 Installation, maintenance and repair of energy efficiency equipment, 7.5 Installation, maintenance and repair of instruments and devices for measuring, regulation and controlling energy performance of buildings and 7.7 Acquisition and ownership of buildings.\n- \u00b7 BraunAbility is a global manufacturer of mobility transportation solutions, including wheelchair accessible vehicles, wheelchair lifts and seating, storage and securement products. BraunAbility's main eligibility is for three categories CCM 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport, 3.18 Manufacture of automotive and mobility components and CE 5.1 Repair, refurbishment and remanufacturing.\n- \u00b7 Permobil's products include a range of manual wheelchairs, which are classified as Personal Mobility Devices with a propulsion that comes from the physical activity of the user. Permobil has eligibility for three economic activities CCM 3.3 Manufacture of low carbon technologies for transport, 6.5 Transport by motorbikes, passenger cars and light commercial vehicles and CE 5.2 Sale of spare parts.\n\n## Aligned economic activities\n\nFor an economic activity to be considered taxonomy-aligned, and hence environmentally sustainable, it needs to substantially contribute to at least one of the EU's six environmental objectives and not significantly harm any of the other objectives, so called Do No Significant Harm (DNSH) criteria. Lastly, the Minimum Safeguards needs to be fulfilled.\n\nThe companies have assessed and determined whether their eligible activities complied with the substantial contribution criteria set out in the Taxonomy. Meaning, the thresholds and the criteria to determine whether the activity is contributing towards climate change mitigation (CCM) or towards climate change adaptation (CCA) and if so, what proportion of turnover, CapEx and OpEx are associated with mitigation or adaptation. All alignment reported is from Vectura and relates to the first objective, climate change mitigation.",

Taxonomy-aligned turnover and CapEx consist of investments and revenue that are directly related to projects in line with the EU taxonomy's technical criteria. The substantial contribution criteria for CCM for these activities is energy efficiency. For construction of new buildings, the limit is at least 10/uni202Fpercent lower than the threshold for nearly zero-energy buildings. For renovation of buildings, a reduction of primary energy demand by at least 30/uni202Fpercent is required. For acquisition and ownership, the properties that fall within the top 15/uni202Fpercent in national primary energy demand or properties with an energy declaration in class A, meets the criteria.\n\nVectura's respective projects are reviewed by an external party. When needed, measures are implemented to ensure alignment. As such, additional requirements on energy and water consumption have been introduced. Vectura ensures that their projects have full control of the environmental aspects of selected building materials to avoid chemical pollution and to recycle non-hazardous building waste. As a standard, Vectura's projects work with controls on environmental aspects for selected building materials to avoid pollution of chemicals and to recycle non-hazardous building waste. Further on, to fulfill the DNSH criteria for climate change adaptation for these activities, Vectura has performed climate risk assessments for all properties, carried out by an external party. The analysis has included potential climate risks based on geographic location and possible development in various scenarios produced by the UN climate panel (IPCC), after which action plans have been established. Within activity 7.1 Construction of new buildings, Vectura also includes projects where the projection is taxonomy alignment, even though a final inspection is awaited.\n\nThe last three aligned activities CCM 7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 relates to energy efficiency for buildings, equipment, charging stations for electric vehicles and energy systems, although they have significantly lower eligibility .\n\n## Minimum safeguards\n\nTo determine whether the company complies with the Minimum Safeguards, per Article 18 of the Taxonomy, each company conducted a self-assessment on a company level. The questions were developed to ensure that the companies comply with international standards (e. g., human and labor rights, bribery, taxation and fair competition), such as the OECD Guidelines for Multinational enterprises, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGP) and have policies and processes in place to ensure the adherence to these standards. Investor reviewed the results from the portfolio companies' self-assessments against the result from Investor's own governance, risk and compliance maturity assessment that is made as a part of the Governance Risk and Compliance program (read more on page 75). The maturity assessment is risk based and includes review of the companies' governance structures, policies and procedures, controls and reporting. There are no material deviations in the results from the self-assessments and maturity assessments . Investor has therefore assessed that the requirements for minimum safeguards are being met.\n\n## Contextual information\n\nThe data collected from each wholly-owned company, that is used to determine the denominator for turnover, CapEx and OpEx, have been reconciled to the financial data used for Group consolidation purposes. Any differences have been evaluated, and if necessary, corrected. All information used for calculating taxonomy eligibility and alignment are stored in the Group accounting consolidation system which makes it possible to have a clear audit trail and prevent double counting.\n\n## Changes compared to last year\n\nWe have updated our accounting policies concerning activities that are not part of our companies core business. In accordance with the EU taxonomy, our accounting policies for the current fiscal year include CapEx associated with the acquisition of solar cells. Furthermore, our taxonomy reporting includes CapEx for\n\nleasing and investments in automobiles and buildings for all companies, last year only Vectura had eligibility related to buildings.\n\nIn accordance with the updated criteria outlined in the EU taxonomy, our accounting policies have been updated to explicitly address eligibility for the four new objectives. More specifically the eligible activities CCM 3.18, CE 1.2, CE 5.1, CE 5.2 and PPC 1.2 were introduced in the EU taxonomy regulation during 2023. As alignment is not reported for the fiscal year 2023, no analysis for alignment has been performed. Investor aim to provide voluntary reporting of the complete portfolio when data for all six environmental objectives are available from all portfolio companies.\n\n## Eligibility\n\nFollowing the four new environmental objectives and implementation of new economic activities, the eligibility for turnover has increased to 30/uni202Fpercent (20). The economic activities CCM 3.18 and CE 5.1 has increased BraunAbility's eligibility for turnover and the economic activity CE 5.2. has increased Permobil's eligibility for turnover. The eligibility for CapEx was 34/uni202Fpercent (36) and the eligibility of OpEx was 20/uni202Fpercent (14).\n\n## Alignment\n\nTaxonomy-aligned CapEx accounted for 73/uni202Fpercent of Vectura's total CapEx in 2023 (68). A large portion relates to the construction of new buildings, followed by renovations and acquisitions. Taxonomy-aligned CapEx consist of investments that are directly related to projects in line with the technical criteria.\n\nThe assessment from Vectura, shows that 50/uni202Fpercent of their turnover was taxonomy aligned in 2023 (35). This includes income from Vectura's properties that fall within the top 15/uni202Fpercent properties in national primary energy demand and properties with an energy declaration in class A.\n\nIn 2023, taxonomy-aligned OpEx accounted for 26/uni202Fpercent of Vectura's total OpEx (11), all related to the acquisition and ownership of buildings. The main OpEx for Vectura consist of minor renovations in properties awaiting projects that will bring them into alignment with the Taxonomy.",

The Company has defined the scope of the Sustainability Report on page 76 in the Annual Report.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team for the Sustainability Report\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team are responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report in accordance with the applicable criteria, as explained on page 76 in the Annual Report, and are the parts of the Sustainability Reporting Guidelines published by GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) which are applicable to the Sustainability Report, as well as the accounting and calculation principles that the Company has developed. This responsibility also includes the internal control relevant to the preparation of a Sustainability Report that is free from material misstatements, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Auditor\n\nOur responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Sustainability Report based on the limited assurance procedures we have performed. Our engagement is limited to historical information presented and does therefore not cover future-oriented information.\n\nWe conducted our limited assurance engagement in accordance with ISAE 3000 (revised) Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information . A limited assurance engagement consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for the preparation of the Sustainability Report, and applying analytical and other limited assurance procedures. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.\n\nThe firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We are independent of Investor AB in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nThe procedures performed consequently do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nAccordingly, the conclusion of the procedures performed do not express a reasonable assurance conclusion.\n\nOur procedures are based on the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team as described above. We consider these criteria suitable for the preparation of the Sustainability Report.\n\nWe believe that the evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our conclusion below.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the limited assurance procedures we have performed, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Sustainability Report, is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the criteria defined by the Board of Directors and Executive Leadership Team.\n\nStockholm March, 2024\n\nDeloitte AB\n\nJonas St\u00e5hlberg\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant\n\nAdrian Fintling\n\nExpert Member of FAR",

This corresponded to a turnover rate (market value-based) of 14/uni202Fpercent (9) for the A-share and 39/uni202Fpercent for the B-share (45), compared to 48/uni202Fpercent for Nasdaq Stockholm as a whole (56).

Significant accounting policies for the Parent company can be found on page 150.\n\n## Statement of compliance\n\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. In addition the Swedish rules, RFR 1 Supplementary Accounting Policies for Groups, was applied.\n\n## Basis of preparation for the Parent company and consolidated financial statements\n\nThe financial statements are presented in SEK, which is the functional currency of the Parent company. All amounts, unless otherwise stated, are rounded to the nearest million (SEK m). Due to rounding, numbers presented throughout these consolidated financial statements may not add up precisely to the totals provided and percentages may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.\n\nThe majority of the consolidated assets are financial assets and the majority of these as well as the majority of the real estate property within the Group are measured at fair value. Other assets and liabilities are in essence measured at historical cost.\n\nNon-current assets and non-current liabilities consist primarily of amounts that are expected to be settled more than 12 months from the balance sheet date. Other assets and liabilities are presented as current assets and current liabilities.\n\nThe accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented in the financial statements, unless otherwise noted. The accounting policies have also been consistently applied to the reporting and consolidation of the Parent company, subsidiaries and associates.\n\nCertain comparative figures have been reclassified in order to conform to the presentation of the current year's financial statements. In cases where reclassifications pertains to significant amounts, special information has been provided.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies\n\nThe following is a description of the revised accounting policies applied by the Group and Parent company as of January 1, 2023.\n\n## Changes in accounting policies due to new or amended IFRS\n\nFrom January 1, 2023 there are amendments in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements resulting in changed requirements regarding disclosures of accounting policies. Significant instead of material accounting policies should be disclosed. In IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors a definition of estimate is introduced with the aim to clarify the differences between estimates, judgments and errors. In IAS 12 Income Taxes changes are made to clarify that transactions that simultaneously gives rise to an asset and a liability should not be covered by the exemption from account for deferred tax on temporary differences. The amendments are approved by EU. None of the amendments have had any significant effect on the accounting for the Group, but resulted in disclosures not considered significant being deleted and significant accounting policies to some extent being clarified.\n\n## New IFRS regulations and interpretations to be applied in 2024 or later\n\nThere are no published changes to IFRS and IFRIC to be applied in the future that are expected to have any significant impact on the Group's reporting.\n\nFrom January 1, 2024 amendments in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements come in to force clarifying when liabilities are to be classified as short-term. Furthermore there have been minor amendments to IFRS 16 Leases for the requirements for sale and leaseback transactions and new disclosure requirements for supplier finance arrangements in IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.\n\nThe amendments that will be in force from January 1, 2024 are approved by EU.\n\n## Consolidation principles\n\nThe consolidated financial statements comprise of the Parent company, subsidiaries and associates. The assessment of Investor is that the Investment entity criteria in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements are not fulfilled, mainly in regards of the purpose of the business and the lack of exit strategies.\n\nThe following symbols IS and BS show which amounts in the notes that can be found in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet.\n\n## Note 2: Critical estimates and key judgments\n\nIn order to close the books and prepare the financial statements in accordance with IFRS, management must make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of the accounting policies and the amounts recognized for assets, liabilities, income and expenses.\n\nEstimates and judgments are based on historical experience, market information and assumptions that management considers to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and the actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made.\n\n## Judgments in relation to the application of accounting policies\n\nWithin the scope of IFRS, there are some instances where management must either choose between accounting policies, or choose whether to apply a particular accounting policy, in order to provide a fair view of the Group's activities. The development relating to accounting and the choice of policies are discussed in the Audit and Risk Committee.\n\nSignificant items for which a special judgment has been made in order to define the Group's accounting policies are presented below.\n\n|                                                       | Judgments                       | See note   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------|\n| Consolidation principles                              | Investment entity or not        | 1          |\n| Participations in Group  companies                    | Control over investment or not  | M7         |\n| Participations in associates                          | Fair value or equity method     | 20         |\n| Owner-occupied property                               | Revaluation or cost model       | 17         |\n| Interest-bearing liabilities  and related derivatives | Application of hedge accounting | 32         |",

Currently there is high uncertainty in the global economy when it comes to geopolitical tensions and war, which may have a material impact on the financial risks. Risks and uncertainty factors are described further in detail in the Administration report on pages 53-56. Investor's Finance policy adopted by the Board sets principles, limits and mandates to mitigate financial risks such as market risk, liquidity and financing risk as well as credit risks. The main financial risks that the Investor Group is exposed to is market risks. Derivative instruments may be used to manage financial risks. All derivative transactions are handled in accordance with established policies and procedures.\n\nRisk measurement is performed daily regarding the Treasury and Trading businesses and provided to Investor's Management. Financial reports are compiled monthly and followed-up by Management. Yearly a more comprehensive risk assessment is performed.\n\nThe Board follows up frequently on limits and risk exposure to ensure the abil-\n\nity to reach business strategies and goals. There has been no significant change in the measurement and follow-up of risks compared with the preceding year.\n\nThe financial risks in the subsidiaries are managed by each subsidiary's Finance function and reported to respective board.\n\n## Market risks\n\nMarket risks refer to the risk of a change in value of a financial instrument because of changes in share prices, exchange rates or interest rates.\n\n## Share price risk\n\nInvestor's most significant risk is share price risk. The majority of Investor's share price risk exposure is concentrated to Listed Companies. At year-end 2023, Listed Companies accounted for 79/uni202Fpercent of total assets of reported values (77). The companies are analyzed and continuously monitored by Investor's analysts. Thus, a large portion of share price exposure in a listed company does not necessarily lead to any action. It is the long-term commitment that lays the groundwork for Investor's strategic measures. Investor does not have defined goals for share price risks, as share prices are affected by short term fluctuations. The share price risk for the listed companies is not hedged. If the market value of Listed Companies was to decline by 10/uni202Fpercent, the impact on income and equity would be SEK -57.6bn (-47.5).\n\nPatricia Industries including wholly-owned subsidiaries, Three Scandinavia and financial investments, but excluding Patricia Industries' cash, accounted for 10/uni202Fpercent of total assets of reported values (11). There is no share price risk associated with the wholly-owned subsidiaries. However, Patricia Industries' listed financial investments face a share price risk. A 10/uni202Fpercent decline in share prices for the financial investments would impact income and equity with SEK/uni202F0m (2.5).\n\nThe investment in EQT AB is listed and as such exposed to share price risk. The EQT fund investments are partly exposed to share price risk. The total EQT investment accounted for 11/uni202Fpercent of total assets of reported values (11) as per year-end 2023. Should the market value and the valuation parameters, in accordance with the guidelines of the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, decline with 10/uni202Fpercent, the impact on the values of the total EQT investment would be SEK -8.2bn (-7.0).\n\nInvestor has a trading operation for the purpose of executing Listed Companies transactions and obtaining market information. The trading operation conducts\n\nshort-term equity trading and deals in equity derivatives (primarily for hedging market risk in the portfolio). The market risk in this activity is measured and monitored in terms of cash delta. Limits on gross, net and maximum position size are measured as well as liquidity risk. At year-end 2023, the trading operation accounted for less than 0.5/uni202Fpercent of total assets of reported values (0.5). If the market value of the assets belonging to the trading operation were to decline by 10/uni202Fpercent, the impact on income would be SEK -20.5m (-11.4).\n\n## Listed holdings in all business areas\n\nListed holdings in all business areas account for 86/uni202Fpercent of total assets of reported values (84). If the market value of listed holdings in all business areas were to decline by 10/uni202Fpercent, the impact on income and equity would be SEK/uni202F-62.6bn (-51.4), which equals 8.7/uni202Fpercent of Investor's reported net asset value (8.5). Market risks associated with listed shares constitute the greatest risk for Investor.\n\n## Exchange rate risk\n\nCurrency exposure arises in the translation of Balance sheet items to foreign currencies (balance sheet exposure), from cash flows in foreign currencies (transaction exposure), and the translation of foreign subsidiaries' Balance sheets and Income statements to the Group's accounting currency (translation exposure).\n\nThere is no regular hedging of foreign currency since the investment horizon is long-term and currency fluctuations are expected to equal out over time. This hedging policy is subject to continuous evaluation and deviations from the policy may be allowed if judged beneficial from a market economic perspective. Exchange rate risk in excess liquidity on group level resulting from investments in foreign currency is managed through currency derivative contracts. Exchange rate risk arising in connection with loans in foreign currency is managed by, among other things, exchanging the loans to SEK through currency swap contracts. This strategy is applied considering the holdings in foreign currency.\n\n## Balance sheet exposure\n\nSince the majority of listed companies are listed in SEK, there is a limited direct exchange rate risk that affects Investor's Balance sheet. However, Investor is indirectly exposed to exchange rate risks in listed companies that are listed on foreign stock exchanges or that have foreign currency as their pricing currency. In addition, there are indirectly exchange rate risks since the majority of the companies in the Listed Companies business area are active in several markets.\n\nThese risks have a direct impact on the respective company's Balance sheet and Income statement, which indirectly affects valuation of the shares.\n\nThe wholly-owned subsidiaries are exposed to exchange rate risks in businesses and investments made in foreign companies. Also the EQT fund investment is exposed to exchange rate risks.\n\nAt year-end 2023, shares and participations recognized at fair value with an exposure to EUR amounted to SEK/uni202F43,801m (9, 274) and with exposure to USD amounted to SEK/uni202F35,412m (42,227). The significant increase in exposure against EUR mainly referes to EQT funds being moved from a company with EUR as reporting currency to a company with SEK as reporting currency, but also value increase for the W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 holding. The decrease in exposure against USD are to the larger extent dependent on value decrease for the holding in Nasdaq and changes in EQT funds.",

The significant currency risk exposure relates to some items in EUR and USD, see the table below. There are no hedging of the financial liabilities in foreign currency with significant exposure.\n\n| Exposure in                                                 | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022   | 12/31 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|\n| foreign currencies, SEK m                                   | EUR          | USD          | EUR          | USD          |\n| Cash and cash equivalents                                   | 3,486        | 1,057        | 3,219        | 403          |\n| Long-term liabilities                                       | 36,559       | 12,098       | 36,147       | 12,019       |\n| Net of group internal receiva- bles (+) and liabilities (-) | -1,824       | 6,359        | -1,145       | 5,497        |\n\nThe monetary financial instruments of the Investor Group are mainly sensitive to changes in rates for EUR/SEK and USD/SEK. If the SEK were to appreciate with 10 pecent against EUR, the impact on income would be SEK/uni202F3.5bn (3.4). An appreciation of SEK against USD would impact income with SEK/uni202F0.3bn (1.0).\n\n## Currency exposure associated with transactions\n\nInvestor and its subsidiaries seeks primarily to find natural hedges of transactions in foreign currencies, i.e. matching cash inflow with outflow in the same currency. The subsidiaries do not normally hedge their operational cash flows.\n\nThe Investor Board of Directors have decided on limits for the Parent company for the major currencies EUR and USD, on outstanding exposure at a specific time. Cash flows in other foreign currencies exceeding SEK/uni202F50m are to be hedged. As per year-end there was no such hedge outstanding.\n\nCurrency exposure associated with net investments in foreign operations Currency exposure associated with investments made in independent foreign entities is considered as a translation risk and not an economic risk. The exposure arises when the foreign net investment is translated to SEK on the balance sheet date and it is recognized in the translation reserve under equity. To reduce such currency exposure Investor targets primarily to neutralize net investments in foreign currencies with loans in the same currency. Remaining currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations is not hedged.\n\nThe table below show the exposure, in main currencies, arising from net investments in foreign subsidiaries (in investment currency).\n\n| Currency exposure in equity   | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| EUR m                         | 4,899        | 4,696        |\n| USD m                         | 2,782        | 3,181        |\n\nIf the SEK were to appreciate by 10/uni202Fpercent this would decrease equity by SEK/uni202F-8.2bn due to translation effects of currency exposure in net investments in foreign subsidiaries (-8.8).\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group's interest rate risk is primarily associated with long-term borrowings. In order to minimize the effects of interest rate fluctuations, limits and instructions have been established for example regarding fixed interest rate periods.\n\n## Excess liquidity and debt portfolio\n\nInvestor AB's Treasury manages interest rate risks, exchange rate risks, liquidity risks and financing risks associated with the administration of the excess liquidity portfolio and financing activities.\n\nFor excess liquidity exposed to interest rate risks, the aim is to limit interest rate risks firstly and secondly to maximize return within the established guidelines of the Finance policy. High financial flexibility is also strived for in order to satisfy future liquidity needs. Investments are therefore made in interest-bearing securities of short duration and high liquidity. For further information, see note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents. A one percentage point parallel movement upward of the yield curve would reduce the value of the portfolio and affect the Income statement by SEK -167m (-271). On the liability side, Investor strives to manage interest rate risks by having an interest rate fixing tenor within the established limits and instructions of the Finance policy. Fixed rates are established to provide flexibility to change the loan portfolio in step with investment activities and to minimize volatility in the cash flow over time. Investor uses derivatives to hedge against interest rate risks (related to both fair value and cash flow fluctuations) in the debt portfolio. Some derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting, but are still grouped together with loans since the intention of the derivative is to achieve the desired fixed-interest term for each loan. The total outstanding carrying amount of hedged loans, including fair value hedge adjustment, was at year-end SEK/uni202F6,364m (6,410).\n\nThe table below shows the value of all interest rate derivatives by the end of 2023. The effect of fair value hedges is recognized in the Income statement. The remaining maturities of fair value hedges vary between 10 and 14 years. For further information on the maturity structure, see schedule, 'Investor AB's debt maturity profile'.\n\n|                                                       | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2023      | 12/31 2022   | 12/31 2022      |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Interest rate derivatives,   fair value hedges, SEK m | Fair value   | Nominal  amount | Fair value   | Nominal  amount |\n| Assets                                                | 681          | 6,336           | 797          | 6,021           |\n| Liabilities                                           | 25           | 1,250           | 17           | 100             |\n\n|                                                      | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2023      | 12/31 2022   | 12/31 2022      |\n|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Interest rate derivatives,   cash flow hedges, SEK m | Fair value   | Nominal  amount | Fair value   | Nominal  amount |\n| Assets                                               | 20           | 979             | 51           | -               |\n| Liabilities                                          | 29           | 2,360           | 97           | 3,627           |\n\nFor more information on financial instruments and hedge accounting, see note 31, Financial instruments.\n\nThe table below shows the effect of a parallel movement of the yield curve up with one percentage point (100 basis points) for the Group's fair value loans and derivatives.\n\n|                                                                      | 12/31 2023                   | 12/31 2023                               | 12/31 2022                   | 12/31 2022                               |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Interest sensitivity of loans  and derivatives at fair value,  SEK m | Effect on  income  statement | Effect on  other com- prehensive  income | Effect on  income  statement | Effect on  other com- prehensive  income |\n| Hedged loans                                                         | -566                         | -                                        | -575                         | -                                        |\n| Swaps for hedges                                                     | 524                          | 6                                        | 570                          | 31                                       |\n| Other swaps                                                          | -12                          | -                                        | -12                          | -                                        |\n| Net interest rate  sensitivity                                       | -54                          | 6                                        | -17                          | 31                                       |\n\nThe interest cost effect related to instruments with floating interest is non- material at a parallel movement of the yield curve with one percentage point.\n\n## Liquidity and financing risk\n\nLiquidity risk refers to the risk that a financial instrument cannot be divested without considerable extra costs, and to the risk that liquidity will not be available to meet payment commitments.\n\nLiquidity risks are reduced in Treasury operations by limiting the maturity of short-term cash investments and by ensuring that cash and committed credit lines always exceed short-term debt, i.e. a liquidity ratio higher than one. Liquid funds are invested in deposit markets and short-term interest-bearing securities with low risk and high liquidity. In other words, they are invested in a wellfunctioning second-hand market, allowing conversion to cash when needed.\n\nLiquidity risk in the trading operations is restricted via limits established by the/uni202FBoard.\n\nFinancing risks are defined as the risk that financing can not be obtained, or can only be obtained at increased costs as a result of changed conditions in the capital market. To reduce the effect of refinancing risks, limits are set regarding average maturities for loans. Financing risks are further reduced by allocating loan maturities over time (please refer to Investor AB's debt maturity profile) and by diversifying sources of capital. An important aspect, in this context, is the ambition to have a long-term borrowing profile. Furthermore, proactive liquidity planning efforts also help limit both liquidity and financing risk.",

Investor has a European Medium Term Note Program (EMTN), which is a loan program intended for long-term financing. The program is for EUR 5.0bn (SEK/uni202F55.5bn), of which EUR 3.1bn (SEK/uni202F34.1bn) has been utilized.\n\nFor short-term financing, Investor has an uncommitted Swedish and a European Commercial Paper program (CP/ECP) for SEK/uni202F10.0bn and USD 1.5bn (SEK/uni202F15.1bn), respectively. These programs are dormant and at year-end 2023 these facilities were unutilized.\n\nAt year-end Investor had a committed syndicated bank loan facility of SEK/uni202F8.0bn. The facility was unutilized at year-end. This facility is available until 2028, with an option to prolong two years. In contrast to an uncommitted credit facility, a committed loan program is a formalized commitment from the credit grantor. There are no financial covenants in any of Investor AB's loan contracts, meaning that Investor does not have to meet special requirements with regard to key financial ratios for the loans it has obtained.\n\nThe wholly-owned subsidiaries ensure their financial preparedness by keeping credit facilities, should there be a need for additional working capital or minor acquisitions. The terms of the credit facilities require the companies to meet a number of covenants. During the year the subsidiaries have fulfilled all covenants.\n\nWith an equity/assets ratio of 86/uni202Fpercent at year-end (84), Investor has considerable financial flexibility, since leverage is low and most assets are highly liquid.\n\nThe following table shows the Group's contracted cash flow of loans including other financial payment commitments and derivatives.\n\n|                                                                | 12/31 2023                                                      | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022                                                      | 12/31 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Cash flow of financial liabilities  and derivatives 1) , SEK m | Loans and   other financial  debts and  commitments Derivatives |              | Loans and   other financial  debts and  commitments Derivatives |              |\n| < 6 months                                                     | -9,964                                                          | 26           | -7,482                                                          | 190          |\n| 6-12 months                                                    | -2,927                                                          | 17           | -1,460                                                          | -18          |\n| 1-2 years                                                      | -15,017                                                         | -215         | -14,130                                                         | 1            |\n| 2-5 years                                                      | -26,350                                                         | -279         | -30,470                                                         | 38           |\n| > 5 years                                                      | -59,784                                                         | -26          | -60,026                                                         | 809          |\n\n1) Interest payments included.\n\nFor information on the Group's excess liquidity and how it is invested, see note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.\n\nExposure from guarantees and other contingent liabilities also constitutes a liquidity risk. For such exposure as per December 31, 2023, see note 33, Pledged assets and contingent liabilities.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nCredit risk is the risk of a counterparty or issuer being unable to repay a liability to Investor. Despite the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical uncertainties that have impacted the global economy negatively, Investor and the subsidiaries have not been affected by any major credit loss during the year.\n\nInvestor is exposed to credit risks primarily through investments of excess liquidity in interest-bearing securities, which all are market valued. Credit risks also arise as a result of positive market values in derivative instruments (mainly interest rate, currency swaps). Investor applies a wide-ranging limit structure with regard to maturities, issuers and counterparties in order to limit credit risks on single counterparties. With a view to further limiting credit risks in interest rate and currency swaps, and other derivative transactions, agreements are established with counterparties in accordance with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), as well as netting agreements. Credit risk is monitored daily and the agreements with various counterparties are continuously analyzed. For more information see note 32, Financial instruments.\n\nThe following table shows the total credit risk exposure by rating category as of December 31, 2023.\n\n| Exposure per   rating category   | Nominal  amount,  SEK m   |   Average  remaining  maturity,  months |   Number of  counter-  parties |   Percentage  of the credit  risk exposure |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|\n| Government bonds (AAA)           | 1,400                     |                                     1.3 |                              1 |                                          4 |\n| AAA                              | 13,406                    |                                    11.8 |                             11 |                                         37 |\n| AA                               | 6,922                     |                                     0.3 |                             62 |                                         19 |\n| A                                | 14,226                    |                                     0.8 |                             39 |                                         39 |\n| Lower than A                     | 243                       |                                    10.5 |                             16 |                                          1 |\n| Total                            | 36,196                    |                                     4.9 |                            129 |                                        100 |\n\nThe total credit risk exposure at the end of 2023 amounted to SEK/uni202F36,196m (36,859). The credit risks resulting from positive market values for derivatives, which are included in the total credit risk, amounted to SEK/uni202F1,218m (945) and is reported in the Balance sheet.\n\nThe credit risk in the wholly-owned subsidiaries relates mainly to trade account receivables. M\u00f6lnlycke's and Permobil's credit risks are limited due to the fact that a significant portion of their customers are public hospitals/care institutions.\n\nThe maximum exposure related to commercial credit risk corresponds to the carrying amount of trade receivables. Assessment of expected losses is described in note 32, Financial instruments.\n\nThe following table shows the aging of trade receivables and other short-term receivables within the Group.\n\n|                              | 12/31 2023              | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022              | 12/31 2022   | 12/31 2022   |\n|------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Aging of receivables,  SEK m | Gross  carrying  amount | Impair- ment | Net          | Gross  carrying  amount | Impair- ment | Net          |\n| Not past due                 | 6,269                   | -31          | 6,238        | 5,748                   | -22          | 5,726        |\n| Past due 0-30 days           | 985                     | -11          | 974          | 1,075                   | -8           | 1,067        |\n| Past due 31-90 days          | 623                     | -13          | 610          | 688                     | -8           | 680          |\n| Past due 91-180 days         | 302                     | -15          | 286          | 290                     | -6           | 284          |\n| Past due 181-360  days       | 179                     | -21          | 158          | 155                     | -22          | 133          |\n| More than 360 days           | 196                     | -71          | 126          | 145                     | -74          | 71           |\n| Total                        | 8,555                   | -162         | 8,393        | 8,101                   | -141         | 7,960        |\n\n## Concentrations of credit risks\n\nConcentrations of risk are defined as individual positions or areas accounting for a significant portion of the total exposure to each area of risk.\n\nBecause of the global nature of its business and sector diversification, the Group does not have any specific customers representing a significant portion of receivables.\n\nThe concentration of credit risk exposure related to fair value reported items, is presented in the table in the middle column. The secured bonds issued by Swedish mortgage institutions have the primary rating category of AAA. The proportion of AAA-rated instruments accounted for 41/uni202Fpercent of the total credit risk exposure (63).",

The companies have aligned their climate targets with the Paris Agreement. The companies are encouraged to commit to Science Based Targets when relevant and to report in accordance with recommendations from Task force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures.\n\nOne of Investor's sustainability targets is to reduce absolute GHG emissions from portfolio companies by 70/uni202Fpercent by 2030 compared to 2016 (the portfolio companies' scope 1 and 2). The target is set for the overall portfolio and companies can therefore have different reduction targets and investment needs.\n\nAs an engaged long-term owner, we strive to empower our companies to invest and innovate. The future success of our companies depends on their capacity to drive change and to invest for the long-term in new solutions that are more resource efficient and that meet the needs of their customers, not only today but also tomorrow. We encourage our companies to invest in innovation and develop products that make a positive contribution to the environment. We follow-up on our portfolio companies yearly regarding waste, water consumption and carbon emissions. Investor encourage our companies to set targets regarding resource efficiency.\n\nIn Investor's TCFD Report, published on the webpage, information about Investor's processes for risk assessment is described and how the responsibility for potential risks and opportunities are handled within different levels of the Group. For our portfolio of listed companies, more details on their industry and business-specific risks and opportunities can be found in their own TCFD reports or addressed in their own sustainability reporting.\n\nThe Investor subsidiaries within Patricia Industries have both short-term and long-term environmental and climate related risks and opportunities. In this note these are described more in detail and which effects they have had or can have on the financial reporting. The overall assessment for all risks and opportunities is that they do not have any significant effect on the financial reporting neither in the short-term nor the long-term perspective.\n\nInvestor's contribution is performed through the governance model and Investor's value creation plan for each company.\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities connected to a sustainable low carbon economy\n\nThere is a risk that our portfolio companies do not transform quickly enough to meet the demands for a sustainable low carbon economy. This can affect the companies possibility to meet customer demand for products and services. At the same time there are opportunities for increased market shares and lower costs for energy and GHG emissions. To accelerate the transition and reduce the risk, the following initiatives are being implemented among other measures:\n\n## \u00b7 Increased efforts within research and development\n\nAs presented in note 10, Operating costs, costs related to research and development has increased with 13/uni202Fpercent during 2023 compared to 2022. Incurred costs aim to develop new products and services that can eventually generate future revenues. In addition to these costs, the companies have had expenses for development activities expected to generate revenues in the near future. These are detailed in note 16, Intangible assets.\n\n## \u00b7 Adapt service and product offering\n\nOne of the companies that especially is affected by changing needs connected to a sustainable low carbon economy, is BraunAbility that for example make wheelchair accessible vehicles. Here the transition from fossil-fueled vehicles to electric and autonomous vehicles, affects both production and market to a large extent. This for example would have an effect on impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, and the useful life of existing machinery and equipment in the production facilities. In the short-term forecasts this future transition have had limited effect. However, in the longer run forecasted future cashflows will be affected of both changed margins and the need for investments.\n\n## \u00b7 Integrate sustainability in business model\n\nBy clearly integrating sustainability in the business model the companies can reach financial advantages through increased demand and new markets. One example is the real-estate company Vectura, that has EU taxonomy aligned turnover, CapEx and OpEx related to the objective climate change mitigation. Vectura's aim is to be a leader for both constructing and managing properties when it comes to minimum climate impact and circular material flow. More financial information related to this can be found in note 18, Investment property and in the chapter EU taxonomy on pages 81-85.\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities connected to new technology\n\nTechnology is mainly regarded as an opportunity for Investor and our portfolio companies, as we are on the frontline of technological development. The main opportunity relates to being customers' preferred choice by leveraging new technology to take the lead in developing products and services with a low or positive climate impact. However, there is always a risk that our companies do not adopt quickly enough. Increased resources on research and development, and development of technologies for market leading products and services are therefore important. As shown in note 16, Intangible assets, capitalized development expenditure and proprietary technology have increased due to both business combinations, internally generated intangible assets and other acquisitions. For example, Piab is in the forefront in producing and distributing gripping and moving solutions for end-users and manufactures, in order to improve energy efficiency, productivity and working environment.\n\n## Transition risks and opportunities connected to policy changes and carbon pricing\n\nTo reach the targets agreed upon in the Paris Agreement, it is likely that governments and international bodies such as EU, will continue to introduce various regulatory measures, that will increase the price of GHG emissions. Most of our holdings have a comparably low fossil dependency and it is likely that only a few larger manufacturing plants will be affected by increased carbon costs. Investments are made continuously for increased energy efficiency, renewable energy and reduced emissions.\n\nAs an example, M\u00f6lnlycke has committed to transitioning to 100/uni202Fpercent fossil-free electricity by the end of 2024 as part of its efforts to achieve its Science- Based Target aligned with the 1.5\u00b0C goal. The company has entered into a virtual Power Purchase Agreement (vPPA) with Neoen for a wind farm in Finland covering the factories in Belgium, Czech Republic and Denmark (35 GWh/y during 10 years). A second vPPA in Malaysia was signed with Engie (14 GWh/y for 21 years) in early 2024. In addition, solar power plants were installed on two facilities to increase the share of renewable energy and several sites are planning to do the same in 2024.\n\nInvestments in solar panels and other energy efficiency measures mainly have financial impact on property, plant and equipment. Power Purchase Agreements can have financial impact on the financial instruments for the Group.\n\nBased on the scope 1 and 2 emissions for the portfolio companies within Patricia Industries, and an estimated carbon cost of SEK/uni202F1,000 per tonnes, the additional cost would lead to a 0.2/uni202Fpercentage point lower EBITA margin for Patricia Industries.\n\n## Other climate related risks\n\nAs described in Investor's TCFD report there are also other climate related risks such as reputational risks and acute and chronic risks related to physical assets and production facilities. These risks have not yet had any effect on the financial reports, but can in the future affect for example provisions for environmental- and climate-related commitments, increased need for investments and write-down of property, plant and equipment.",

Goodwill and strong trademarks that are considered to have an indefinite useful life, are not amortized but tested annually for impairment, or whenever there is any indication of impairment.\n\nConsideration that is contingent upon the outcome of future events is valued at fair value and the change in value is recognized in the Income statement.\n\nTransaction related costs derive from external legal fees and due diligence expenses. These costs are included in the line item Administrative, research and development and other operating cost in the Group's consolidated income statement.\n\n## Non-controlling interests\n\nAt the time of an acquisition, the Group must choose to either recognize non-controlling interest at fair value, meaning that goodwill is included in the non-controlling interest or recognize the non-controlling interest as the share of the net identifiable assets. The Group have chosen to recognize the non-controlling interest as the share of the net identifiable assets for all acquisitions.\n\nFor information regarding put options to non-controlling interests, see note 26, Equity.\n\n## Laborie's acquisition of Urotronic\n\nOn October 27, 2023, Laborie acquired the remaining 91/uni202Fpercent of Urotronic, a US medical technology company, including its OptilumeTM device for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). In 2020, Laborie entered a strategic partnership with Urotronic, whereby Laborie acquired 9/uni202Fpercent of the company. The consideration for the 91/uni202Fpercent amounted to SEK/uni202F2,235m and was funded with USD 225m in equity from Patricia Industries, in addition to cash from Laborie. In addition, up to USD 314m in additional payments contingent on the achievement of revenue and reimbursement milestones may fall out. The acquisition adds new innovative, highly differentiated products with significant growth potential. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, goodwill amounted to SEK/uni202F2,164m. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Transaction related costs amounted to SEK/uni202F65m.\n\n## Permobil's acquisition of PDG Mobility\n\nOn September 13, 2023, Permobil finalized the acquisition of PDG Mobility, a Canada-based global leader in designing and manufacturing manual 'tilt-in-space' wheelchairs. The consideration amounted to SEK/uni202F144m and was funded with cash from Permobil. The acquisition adds expertise and a leading range of tilt-in-space products to Permobil's best-in-class portfolio of complex rehabilitation solutions. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, goodwill amounted to SEK/uni202F119m. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Transaction related costs amounted to SEK/uni202F4m.\n\n## Piab's acquisition of IB\n\nOn April 20, 2023, Piab finalized the acquisition of IB Verfahrens- und Anlagentechnik GmbH & Co. KG. IB develops and builds customer-specific, turnkey systems for filling, emptying, metering, and conveying bulk materials. The consideration amounted to SEK/uni202F117m and was funded with cash from Piab. The acquisition of IB product portfolio completes the Piab additive manufacturing offering and enables Piab Group to offer full powder handling solutions, particularly in the Food, Pharma and Chemical industries. In the preliminary purchase price allocation, goodwill amounted to SEK/uni202F86m. The goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes. Transaction related costs amounted to SEK/uni202F9m.\n\n## Piab's acquisition of COVAL\n\nOn March 28, 2023, Piab finalized the acquisition of COVAL, a global player in vacuum automation components and systems. The consideration amounted to SEK/uni202F716m and was funded with SEK/uni202F222m in equity from Patricia Industries, in addition to cash from Piab and external debt.

Dividends received are recognized when the right to receive payment has been established.\n\n## Disaggregated revenues from contracts with customers into the field of operation\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods or services, and leasing, are disaggregated into the four field of operations Health care equipment, Life science, Real estate, and Gripping and moving solutions.\n\n## Health care equipment\n\nThe majority of the revenues in the field of operations Health care equipment are derived from sale of single use products and solutions for managing wounds and preventing pressure ulcers. This field of operations also includes sales from: wheelchair accessible vehicles and wheelchair lifts; powered and manual wheelchairs as well as cushions and accessories; distribution of healthcare products to national emergency care providers, hospitals, schools, businesses and federal government agencies; and innovative capital equipment and consumables for the diagnosis and treatment of urological and gastrointestinal disorders.\n\nRevenues within the field of operations Health care equipment are allocated to geographical area by the location of where the customer is resident. Health care equipment are sold through retail distribution channels and directly to customers.\n\nThe sale of medical equipment, products and supplies are recognized at the point of time when control transfers. The sale of extended warranty, service agreements and program management contracts are recognized over the term of the contract.\n\n## Life science\n\nRevenue within the field of operations Life science is mainly earned from the sale of equipment and consumable supplies within osmolality testing. Life science also includes revenue from the sale of advanced reagents for basic and clinical research and services from smart healthtech solutions.\n\nRevenues are allocated into geographical area by the location of where the respective customer uses the services and products.\n\nCustomers within osmolality testing products can separately purchase maintenance contracts and revenue are also earned from servicing of customer equipment and repair calls not covered by maintenance contracts. Revenue from the sale of equipment and consumable supplies is generally recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer. Maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the contract period and revenue from other service or repairment of equipment is recognized when the service is performed.\n\nThe sale of products and services from the sale of reagents for basic and clinical research is mainly performed by own personnel and revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time. The same goes for services from smart healthtech solutions.\n\n## Real estate\n\nThe field of operations Real estate includes revenue from rental agreements with external tenants. The majority of the rental agreements are related to office premises.\n\nRental agreements are signed directly with the tenants and the revenue is recognized over the term of the contract.\n\n## Gripping and moving solutions\n\nThe field of operations Gripping and moving solutions mainly generates revenue from the sale of finished products and customer-specific solutions. The finished products are vacuum pumps, vacuum accessories, vacuum conveyors and suction cups for a variety of automated material handling and factory automation processes. The customer-specific solutions are assembled to the specification of each customer and comprise of products and components in combination with services such as installation and training activities.\n\nRevenues are allocated to geographical area by the location of where the customer is resident. The sale channels are both through distributors and directly to customers and the revenue is mainly recognized at a point in time.\n\n## Performance obligations and Transaction prices\n\nRevenues from the sale of goods or services are derived from four relatively different fields of operations. Below details can be found about different types of performance obligations in the contracts from customers and information about how transaction prices are determined and allocated to performance obligations. The information is on an aggregated level based on different types of customer contracts.\n\n## Sale of finished products\n\nSale of finished products are by far the largest part of Investor's net sales. The products mainly relates to Health care equipment but also products within Life science and Gripping and moving solutions. Performance obligations in the contracts with customers from sale of finished products mainly refers to goods manufactured by the selling company. A minor part of the performance obligations also relates to distribution of goods as retailer, products having a trial period and revenue from customer-specific solutions.\n\nThe sales contracts can, to a limited extent, also include performance obligations related to various forms of services, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations.\n\nFor finished products the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the goods has transferred to the customer. The point in time is upon delivery to the customer or shipment of the goods, which is determined by the delivery terms of each contract. The evaluations in order to identify when a customer obtains control of promised goods is to a large extent based on the shipping terms. This is because shipping terms typically specifies when title passes and will also affect when risk and rewards of ownership transfer to the customer. For the majority of the sale, control is transferred upon delivery of the goods to the customer.\n\nFor distribution of health care products as a retailer, control is transferred upon shipment from the distribution center. At this point in time, the performance obligation is fulfilled and revenue is recognized. For products having a trial period, the revenue is recognized at the expiration of the trial period.\n\nCustomer-specific solutions are mainly relevant within Gripping and moving solutions and represents one performance obligation as a bundle of goods and services, since the separate goods and services are not considered as distinct within the context of each contract. The performance obligation is satisfied over time since the asset is not created with an alternative use to the Group and the Group has an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date.\n\nThe selected method used to measure the progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation is the input method on the basis of cost incurred relative to the total expected costs for each customer-specific solution. Costs mainly include costs for labor and material. The input method is selected since the timing of the costs related to each customer-specific solution provides the best reflection of how control is transferred to the customer. The estimations related to revenue recognition from the input method require judgments that affect the determination of the amount and timing of revenue from customer-specific solutions. The initial estimate of total expected costs of each customer-specific solution is continuously controlled and updated if necessary.\n\nPayment terms varies normally from 30-60 days and could in some instances be up to 90 days. Hence, the contracts does not involve any significant financing component. For certain countries and customers, when deemed appropriate from a credit risk perspective, payment in advance is requested before delivery of goods.\n\nThe transaction price for finished products is typically based on a list price, but where a contract contains elements of variable rebates, right of returns, customer discounts or similar, revenue is recognized net after recognizing a refund liability for such variable considerations. Right of returns is adjusted based on its accumulated historical experience to estimate the number of returns. These variable considerations can be paid both quarterly and yearly dependent on customer contract. The customer accrual of yearly contracts will increase the liability until repayment, which usually takes place during Q1, then the liability will be significantly reduced compared to year-end.\n\n## Sale of services\n\nSales of services mainly relates to services connected with the sale of products, but also services within Life science. The sale of products can, to a limited extent, also include performance obligations related to various forms of services, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations.\n\nWithin Life science the services mainly relates to basic and clinical research related services and services for automated healthcare technology solutions and integrated care platforms. Most of the services are performed as distinct services and each contract therefore identified as one performance obligation.\n\nThere are also performance obligations related to services connected with the sale of products, for example extended warranty, service agreements, program management contracts and similar obligations. Revenues are mainly recognized over time as the services are performed.",

Accrued revenue represents the right to consideration for goods and services that has been transferred to a customer, but payment has not yet been received.\n\nContract liabilities are an entity's obligation to transfer goods and services to a customer for which the entity has received consideration from the customer. These are comprised of deposits and prepayments collected on orders that will be transferred in a future period. Other forms of contract liabilities are payments related to extended warranty contracts and program management contracts, which are deferred and recognized straight-line over the contract life.\n\n## Contract costs\n\nSince all sales commissions paid would have been amortized within one year, the practical expedient to recognize these costs as an expense when incurred is used. However an associated company, accounted for using the equity method, recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer and the asset is amortized as the contracts are completed.\n\n## Net sales 2023\n\n|                                                   | Field of operation      | Field of operation   | Field of operation   | Field of operation             |        |\n|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|--------|\n|                                                   | Health care   equipment | Life  science        | Real estate          | Gripping and  moving solutions | Total  |\n| By geographical market:                           |                         |                      |                      |                                |        |\n| Sweden                                            | 961                     | 148                  | 317                  | 122                            | 1,547  |\n| Scandinavia, excl.

The lease liability is included in Long-term interest-bearing liabilities and Current interest-bearing liabilities.\n\n## Lessor\n\nFor Investor as a lessor, leases are classified as operating leases. The lease contracts do not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying assets. Lease payments from operating leases are recognized as income on a straight-line basis.\n\n## Information about lease contracts - Lessee\n\nLease contracts are related to vehicles, office equipment and rental agreements regarding offices, warehouses and factory buildings.\n\nLeasing contracts for vehicles do normally not include any extension options. Outstanding leasing agreements for offices, warehouses and factories include various extension and termination options, as well as contracts that are automatically extended for a certain period if not actively being canceled.\n\nWhen determining the lease term, extension options are considered. If no plan is initiated to move to another building six months before notice must be given, to not have the contract automatically extended, the extension option is included in the lease period. For other leased buildings individual assessments of the current lease term is made on an ongoing basis.\n\n## Lease amounts for the period - lessee\n\n|                                                                             | 2023   | 2022   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Disclosures related to the financial performance                            |        |        |\n| - Depreciation charge for right-of-use buildings                            | -508   | -407   |\n| -  Depreciation charge for right-of-use machinery and  equipment            | -129   | -127   |\n| - Interest expense on lease liabilities                                     | -77    | -69    |\n| - Expense relating to short-term leases                                     | -57    | -64    |\n| - Expense relating to low-value leases                                      | -14    | -14    |\n| Disclosures related to cash flows                                           |        |        |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, interest                                         | -82    | -69    |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, payment of lease liability                       | -622   | -524   |\n| - Cash outflow for leases, low value and short-term                         | -69    | -74    |\n| Disclosures related to the financial position                               |        |        |\n| -  Carrying amount of right-of-use asset as per   December 31, included in: |        |        |\n| Buildings and land                                                          | 1,943  | 1,856  |\n| Machinery and equipment                                                     | 276    | 247    |\n\n|                                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| - Lease liability as per December 31, included in: |        |        |\n| Long-term interest-bearing liabilities             | 1,641  | 1,653  |\n| Current interest-bearing liabilities               | 586    | 512    |\n\n## Information about lease contracts - lessor\n\nLease contracts are mainly related to rental agreements regarding premises and housing.

This cost is adjusted in subsequent periods to reflect the actual number of vested options and shares. However, no adjustment is made when options and shares expire only because share price related conditions do not reach the level needed for the options to vest.\n\nWhen equity-settled programs are exercised, shares are delivered to the employee. When exercised, the payment of the exercise price that was received from the employee is reported as an increase in equity. The delivered shares are treasury shares that are repurchased when needed.\n\nEquity-settled programs issued to employees in Group companies In the Parent company, the value of equity instruments, which is offered to employees of other companies belonging to the Group, is reported as a capital contribution to subsidiaries. The value of participations in subsidiaries increases simultaneously to the Parent company's reporting of an increase in equity. The costs related to employees in companies concerned are invoiced to the subsidiaries. The cash settlement of the invoices then neutralizes the increase of participations in subsidiaries.\n\n## Accounting for cash-settled programs\n\nCash-settled stock option and share programs and cash-settled (synthetic) shares result in an obligation that is valued at fair value and recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in liabilities. Initial fair value is calculated and the grant value is recognized over the vesting period as a personnel cost, which is similar to the recognition of equity-settled programs. However, cash settled programs are revalued at fair value every balance sheet date and at final settlement. All changes in the fair value as a result of changes in share price or fair value of the underlying instruments are recognized in the financial net with a corresponding change in liabilities.\n\nWhen cash-settled programs are exercised, the liability to the holder of the synthetic shares is settled.\n\nAccounting for social security attributable to share-based payment transactions\n\nSocial security expenses attributable to share-based remuneration are recognized and accrued in accordance with the same principles as the costs for synthetic shares.\n\n## Guidelines for remuneration for the President and other members of the Executive Leadership Team\n\nThe 2020 AGM decided on guidelines for remuneration for the President and other members of the Executive Leadership Team. The complete guidelines can be found on page 68. The proposals for resolutions on guidelines, from the 2024 AGM, can be found on page 69.\n\n## Average number of employees in the Group\n\n|                              | 2023   | 2023              | 2022   | 2022              |\n|------------------------------|--------|-------------------|--------|-------------------|\n|                              | Total  | Of which  females | Total  | Of which  females |\n| Parent company, Sweden       | 78     | 40                | 76     | 38                |\n| Sweden, excl.

program descriptions\n\nThe Board of Directors encourages employees to build up a significant shareholding in Investor. Through the long-term variable remuneration programs, part of the remuneration to employees is linked to the long-term performance of the Investor share. Investor has two programs for long-term variable remuneration: Investor's program and the program for Patricia Industries.\n\n## Investor's program for long-term variable remuneration\n\nThe program consists of the following two components:\n\n## 1) Stock Matching Plan\n\nThrough the Stock Matching Plan, an employee could acquire or commit shares in Investor (Matching share) at the market price during a period (determined by the Board) subsequent to the release of Investor's first quarterly report for each year, respectively (the 'Measurement Period'). After a three-year vesting period, two options (Matching Options) are granted for each Investor share acquired or committed by the employee, as well as a right to acquire one Investor share (Matching Share) for SEK/uni202F10.00. Matching Share may be acquired during a fouryear period subsequent to the vesting period. Each Matching Option entitles the holder to purchase one Investor share, during the corresponding period, at a strike price corresponding to 120/uni202Fpercent of the average volume-weighted price paid for Investor shares during the Measurement Period.\n\nThe President, other members of the Executive Leadership Team and a maximum of 22 other executives within Investor ('holders of Business Critical Roles') are required to participate in the Stock Matching Plan with Participation Shares corresponding to a 'Participation Value' of at least 5/uni202Fpercent of their fixed cash remuneration before taxes. 'Participation Value' refers to the number of Participation Shares multiplied by the Participation Price.\n\nIn addition, holders of Business Critical Roles are offered to participate with Participation Shares to such an extent that the value of the allocated Matching Options and Matching Shares amounts to a maximum of between 10 and approximately 50/uni202Fpercent of their respective annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes, depending on position, performance, etc. Other employees are not obligated, but have a right, to participate with Participation Shares to an extent that the value of the allotted Matching Options and Matching Shares amounts to a maximum of 10 or 15/uni202Fpercent of fixed cash remuneration depending on position, performance, etc.\n\nUnder the Stock Matching Plan, the President is entitled to participate with (invest in) Participation Shares corresponding to a Participation Value of up to 44/uni202Fpercent of the annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes. If the President participates fully in the Stock Matching Plan, the possibility to receive a Matching Shares and Matching Options under the Stock Matching Plan corresponds to a theoretical value of approximately 42/uni202Fpercent of the annual fixed cash remuneration before taxes.\n\n## 2) Performance Plan\n\nHolders of Business Critical Roles have, in addition to the Stock Matching Plan, the right to participate in a Performance Plan. Under this plan, which presumes participation in the Stock Matching Plan, participants have, after a three-year vesting period, the right during a period of four years thereafter, to acquire additional Investor shares of class B ('Performance Shares') at a price corresponding to 50/uni202Fpercent of the Participation Price conditional upon the total return on the Investor shares exceeding a certain level during the vesting period. The total return is measured during a three-year qualification period (quarterly measurement on running 12-month basis where the total outcome is estimated as the average total return during the three years based on 9 measurement points). In order to give the participants the right to acquire the maximum number of Performance Shares, the average annual total return of the Investor share (including reinvested dividends) must exceed the interest on 10-year government bonds by more than 10/uni202Fpercentage points. If the total return does not exceed the 10-year interest on government bonds by at least 2/uni202Fpercentage points, then participants of the Performance Plan are not entitled to acquire any Performance Shares. If the total return is between the 10-year interest on government bonds plus 2/uni202Fpercentage points and the 10-year interest on government bonds plus 10/uni202Fpercentage points, then a proportional (linear) calculation of the number of shares that may be acquired shall be made. The theoretical value of the opportunity to acquire Performance Shares for",

See tabel below for specification of the basis of calculation.\n- 3) Performance Shares not available for exercise at year-end.\n\nThe difference between the theoretical value and fair value is mainly due to the fact that the anticipated personnel turnover is taken into consideration when determining the theoretical value. When estimating the fair value in accordance with IFRS 2, personnel turnover is not taken into account; instead the anticipated number of vested shares or options is adjusted. The adjustment is based on average historical outcome.\n\nThe calculation of the fair value on the grant date, according to IFRS 2, was based on the following conditions:\n\n|                                                             | 2023           | 2023            | 2023              | 2022           | 2022            | 2022              |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n|                                                             | Matching Share | Matching Option | Performance Share | Matching Share | Matching Option | Performance Share |\n| Averaged volume-weighted price paid for Investor   B shares | 215.87         | 215.87          | 215.87            | 176.48         | 176.48          | 176.48            |\n| Strike price                                                | 10.00          | 259.00          | 107.94            | 10.00          | 211.70          | 88.24             |\n| Assumed volatility 1)                                       | 21%            | 21%             | 21%               | 21%            | 21%             | 21%               |\n| Assumed average term 2)                                     | 5 year         | 5 year          | 5 year            | 5 year         | 5 year          | 5 year            |\n| Assumed percentage of dividend 3)                           | 0%             | 2.1%            | 0%                | 0%             | 2.1%            | 0%                |\n| Risk-free interest                                          | 2.48%          | 2.48%           | 2.48%             | 1.62%          | 1.62%           | 1.62%             |\n| Expected outcome 4)                                         |                |                 | 50%               |                |                 | 50%               |\n\n- 1) The assumed volatility was based on future forecasts based on the historical volatility of Investor B shares, in which the term of the instrument is an influencing factor.\n- The historical volatility has been in the interval of 15 to 30/uni202Fpercent.\n- 2) The assumption of average term for the instruments at grant is based on historical exercise patterns and the actual term of the instruments within each remuneration program.\n- 3) The dividend for Matching Shares and Performance Shares is compensated for by increasing the number of shares.\n- 4) Probability to achieve the performance criteria is calculated based on historic data and verified externally.",

The purpose of the PI program is to encourage employees to build up significant economic holdings in Investor shares as well as, directly or indirectly, in existing and future investments made by PI.\n\nIn summary, the PI program is built on the same structure as the Investor program, but is related to the value growth of PI. The instruments in the PI program are granted under two different Plans, as further described below: (i) The PI Balance Sheet Plan (the 'PI-BS Plan') and (ii) The PI North America Subsidiaries Plan (the 'PI-NA Plan').

During the year, a total of SEK/uni202F16m was paid out to employees from this program (82). The provision (not paid out) on unrealized gains amounted to SEK/uni202F61m at year-end (37).\n\n## Incentive programs in Patricia Industries' subsidiaries\n\nSenior executives and selected senior staff in BraunAbility, Laborie, Sarnova and Advanced Instruments, are offered the opportunity to invest in Stock Appreciation Rights and Stock Options in the respective subsidiary. These instruments are mainly cash settled and the participants do not need to make any initial investment.\n\n## Management participation programs\n\nBoard members and senior executives in unlisted investments, including M\u00f6lnlycke, Permobil, Piab, Vectura, BraunAbility, Sarnova, Laborie, Advanced Instruments and Atlas Antibodies are offered the opportunity to invest in the companies through management participation programs or similar. The terms of most of the programs are based on market valuations and are designed to yield lower return to the participants than that of the owners if the investment plan is not reached but higher return to the participants than that of the owners if the plan is exceeded.\n\n## Profit-sharing program for the trading operation\n\nThis program includes participants both from the trading organization and the investment organization. The participants in this program receive, in addition to their base salary, a variable salary equivalent to 20/uni202Fpercent of the trading function's net result. The program includes a clawback principle by which 50/uni202Fpercent of the variable salary allotment is withheld for one year and will only be paid out in full if the trading result for that year is positive. In order to receive full allotment, two consecutive profitable years are required. In total, approximately 10-15 employees participate in the program.\n\n## Accounting effects of share-based payment transactions\n\n| Costs relating to share-based payment transactions, SEK m           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Group                                                               |        |        |\n| Costs relating to equity-settled share-based  payment  transactions | 55     | 44     |\n| Costs relating to cash-settled share-based payment  transactions    | 743    | 260    |\n| Social security relating to share-based payment  transactions       | 106    | 36     |\n| Total                                                               | 904    | 340    |\n| Parent company                                                      |        |        |\n| Costs relating to equity-settled share-based  payment  transactions | 52     | 41     |\n| Costs relating to cash-settled share-based payment  transactions    | 23     | 12     |\n| Social security relating to share-based payment  transactions       | 47     | 7      |\n| Total                                                               | 121    | 60     |\n\n| Other effects of share-based payment transactions, SEK m           | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Group                                                              |        |        |\n| Effect on equity relating to Stock-Options exercised  by employees | 11     | 22     |\n| Carrying amount of liability relating to cash-settled  instruments | 1,321  | 812    |\n| Parent company                                                     |        |        |\n| Effect on equity relating to Stock-Options exercised  by employees | 51     | 22     |\n| Carrying amount of liability relating to cash-settled  instruments | 48     | 73     |\n\n## Remuneration to the Board of the Parent company\n\nAt the 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM), it was decided that Board remuneration should total SEK/uni202F13,325t (12,885), of which SEK/uni202F11,815t (11,415) would be in the form of cash and synthetic shares and SEK/uni202F1,510t (1,470) would be distributed as cash remuneration for committee work done by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Synthetic shares 2008-2023\n\nSince 2008, Board members have been given the opportunity to receive a part of their gross remuneration, excluding committee fees, in synthetic shares. AGM's decision regarding synthetic shares 2023 is essentially identical to the decision of the AGM 2022. In 2023, Board members were entitled to receive 50/uni202Fpercent of the proposed remuneration before tax, excluding remuneration for committee work, in the form of synthetic shares and 50/uni202Fpercent in cash (instead of receiving 100/uni202Fpercent of the remuneration in cash). A synthetic share carries the same economic rights as a class B Investor share, which means that the value of the Board of Director's remuneration in synthetic shares, just like for class B shares, is dependent upon value fluctuations as well as the amount of dividends during the five-year period until 2028, when each synthetic share entitles the Board member to receive an amount corresponding to the share price, at the time, of a class B Investor share. At the statutory meeting in May 2023 the Board approved, as in 2022, establishment of a policy pursuant to which members of the Board (who do not already have such holdings) are expected to, over a five-year period, acquire ownership in Investor shares (or a corresponding exposure to the Investor share, for example in synthetic shares) for a market value that is expected to correspond to at least one year's remuneration for board work, before taxes and excluding remuneration for committee work.\n\nThe Director's right to receive payment occurs after the publications of the yearend report and the three interim reports, respectively, during the fifth year following the general meeting which resolved on the allocation of the Synthetic Shares, with 25/uni202Fpercent of the allocated Synthetic Shares on each occasion. In case the Director resigns as Board member prior to a payment date the Director has a right, within three months after the Director's resignation, to request that the time of payment shall be brought forward, and instead shall occur, in relation to 25/uni202Fpercent of the total number of allocated Synthetic Shares, after the publications of each of the year-end report and the three interim reports, respectively, which are made during the year after the year when such request was received by the Company.",

For more information about net financial items, see note 32, Financial instruments.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nPart of the difference between the effective tax rate and the Parent company's tax rate that occurs upon reconciliation is due to the fact that the Parent company is taxed in accordance with the rules that apply to industrial holding companies.\n\nThe Group applies the exemption for reporting and providing information on deferred tax assets and liabilities related to income taxes from Pillar two, which is specified in the amendments to IAS 12 issued in May 2023.\n\n## Income taxes recognized in the Income statement\n\n|                                    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Current tax                        | -2,060 | -1,252 |\n| Deferred tax                       | 1,132  | 406    |\n| Income tax for current year        | -928   | -845   |\n| Current tax related to prior years | 59     | -233   |\n| IS Income tax expense              | -868   | -1,079 |\n\nInformation about the connection between income tax expense and reported profit before tax\n\n|                                                               | 2023    | 2022    |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Reported profit before tax                                    | 127,686 | -73,684 |\n| Current tax at Swedish statutory rate of 20.6 (20.6)%         | -26,310 | 15,187  |\n| Tax effect of other tax rates in other jurisdictions          | -180    | -261    |\n| Tax effect of changes in tax rates                            | 6       | 1       |\n| Tax effect of non-deductible expenses                         | -5,478  | -29,547 |\n| Tax effect of non-taxable income                              | 30,643  | 14,211  |\n| Tax effect due to status as an industrial holding  company 1) | 823     | 788     |\n| Tax effect of not recognized losses or temporary  differences | -788    | -1,165  |\n| Tax related to prior years                                    | 59      | -233    |\n| Other                                                         | 357     | -60     |\n| IS Income tax expense                                         | -868    | -1,079  |\n\n1) For tax purposes, since all received dividend is taxable, industrial holding companies may deduct the dividend approved at the subsequent Annual general meeting.",

The amount mainly refers to the tax amount of unrecognized losses carry-forward. The amount does not include the Parent company due to its status as an industrial holding company for tax purposes.\n\nTax relating to temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized amounted to SEK/uni202F541m on December 31, 2023 (579). The amount refers to the tax amount on unrealized taxable foreign exchange gain on an intercompany loan that will be taxable when the loan is close to fully repaid. Since the Group has the full decisive power to decide if and when the loan is to be repaid and the Group has no intention to repay the loan within a foreseeable future, no deferred tax liability has been recognized.\n\n## Pillar two\n\nInvestor is covered by the new OECD's Pillar two model rules, adopted into Swedish law as of December 31, 2023. These rules may result in a Top-up tax for the Group in some jurisdictions, where the effective tax rate according to Pillar two is below a minimum tax rate of/uni202F15%. Investor currently evaluates if there are jurisdictions in which Top-up tax may be imposed. The initial assessment is that there is no significant exposure for Top-up tax.\n\n## Note 15: Earnings per share\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nWhen calculating diluted earnings per share, the average number of shares is adjusted to take into account the effects of dilutive potential ordinary shares, originating during the reported periods from stock option and share programs that have been offered to employees. Dilutions from stock option and share programs affect the number of shares and only occur when the strike price is less than the share price.\n\n## Basic earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                        | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit/loss for the year attributable to the holders   of ordinary shares in the Parent company, SEK m | 127,045 | -74,681 |\n| Weighted average number of ordinary shares  outstanding during the year, millions                      | 3,062.8 | 3,063.2 |\n| IS Basic earnings per share, SEK                                                                       | 41.48   | -24.38  |\n| Change in the number of outstanding shares, before dilution                                            | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Total number of outstanding shares at beginning   of the year, millions                                | 3,063.0 | 3,063.5 |\n| Repurchase of own shares during the year, millions                                                     | -0.9    | -0.8    |\n| Sales own shares during the year, millions                                                             | 0.8     | 0.4     |\n| Total number of outstanding shares at   year-end, millions                                             | 3,062.9 | 3,063.0 |\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\n|                                                                                                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Profit for the year attributable to the holders of  ordinary shares in the Parent company, SEK m | 127,045 | -74,681 |\n| Weighted average number of  outstanding  ordinary shares, millions                               | 3,062.8 | 3,063.2 |\n| Effect of issued:                                                                                |         |         |\n| Employee share and stock option programs, millions                                               | 1.7     | 1.5     |\n| Number of shares used for the calculation  of diluted earnings per share, millions               | 3,064.6 | 3,064.7 |\n| IS Diluted earnings per share, SEK                                                               | 41.46   | -24.38  |\n\n## Instruments that are potentially dilutive in the future and changes after the balance sheet date\n\nOutstanding options and shares in long-term share-based programs are to be considered dilutive only if earnings per share was less after than before dilution. Some options are out of money due to a lower average share price (SEK/uni202F210.81) compared to exercise price and potential value per option to be expensed in accordance to IFRS 2. Finally there are Performance Shares for which performance terms and conditions are to be met before they can be dilutive. See note 11, Employees and personnel costs, for exercise price and a description of performance terms and conditions.\n\n## Note 16: Intangible assets\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nIntangible assets, except for goodwill and tradenames with indefinite life, are reported at cost after a deduction for accumulated amortization or any impairment losses.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arises when the acquisition cost in a business combination exceeds the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities according to the purchase price allocation.\n\n## Tradenames and Trademarks\n\nTradenames and Trademarks are valued as part of the fair value of businesses acquired from a third party. The tradenames and trademarks must have long-term value and it must be possible to sell them separately.\n\n## Proprietary technology\n\nProprietary technology consists of assets such as patents and licenses and is valued as part of the fair value of acquired businesses.\n\n## Customer contracts and relations\n\nCustomer contracts and relations are valued as part of the fair value of acquired businesses (less any amortization or impairment losses). The useful life of these assets are sometimes long, which reflects the long-term nature of the underlying business. Customer contracts and relations are based on the period of time over which net payments are expected to be received from the contract, as well as legal and financial factors.\n\n## Amortizations\n\nAmortizations are made linearly over the asset's estimated useful life. Goodwill and tradenames with an indefinite useful life are not amortized.\n\nEstimated useful lives:\n\n| Trademarks                          | 3-15 years   |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|\n| Capitalized development expenditure | 3-10 years   |\n| Proprietary technology              | 5-20 years   |\n| Customer contracts and relations    | 3-18 years   |\n| Software and other                  | 2-10 years   |\n\n## Impairment\n\nThe recoverable amount of an asset is calculated whenever there is an indication of impairment. For goodwill and trademarks with an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is calculated once a year.",

Investor makes regular tests to determine that the carrying values of these assets do not exceed the value in use. The method for impairment testing is based on a discounted cash flow forecast to determine the value in use. Various assumptions are used to suit the different companies and its business. The calculated value in use is then compared to the carrying amount.\n\n## Value in use\n\nValue in use is calculated as Investor's share of present value of future estimated cash flow generated from the subsidiaries. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon reasonable assumptions and best knowledge of the company and future economic conditions. The base for the estimate is an assumption of the future growth rate, budgets and forecasts. The chosen discount factor reflects specific risks that are assignable to the asset and marketable assessments of the time value of money.\n\nIf there are environmental and climate-related risks and opportunities, these have been reflected in forecasts and assumptions of growth rate. In 2023 no apparently significant climate-related risks have been identified, that have had impact on impairment tests. One of the main sustainability focus areas for the portfolio companies is climate and resource efficiency. It is Investor's ambition to reduce the portfolio's carbon footprint by encouraging companies to reduce their carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement. The reduction in carbon emissions will for most companies require investments in both tangible assets and research and development. When calculating the value in use, these future investments have been considered based on forecasts and current value creation plans.\n\nThe base for calculation of the discount rate is the company's weighted average cost of capital, where the assumption of the risk free interest rate, market risk premium, leverage, cost of debt and relevant tax rate are important components. The ambition is to use a discount rate which is not dependent on short term market sentiment, but instead reflects a long-term cost of capital corresponding to Investor's long-term investment horizon.\n\n## Key assumptions\n\nThe estimated value for each cash-generating entity is based on a value in use calculation in which assumptions of future growth rate and operating margins are important components. The estimated value in use is based on the budget for the coming year and financial forecasts for the four years after that (or a longer period if deemed more relevant). Operating margin in the value in use calculations reflect management's past experience together with reasonable assumptions and best knowledge of the company and future economic conditions.\n\nA growth rate of 1.9-2.9/uni202Fpercent has been used to extrapolate the cash flows for the years beyond the forecast period (1.8-2.9/uni202Fpercent in previous year impairment test). The growth-rate is individual for each entity and is considered reasonable given the company's historical growth, geographical positioning and industry fundamentals. A sector's long-term growth drivers, such as demographics and lifestyle aspects can be considered as well.\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nFor all entities except Atlas Antibodies the assessment is that no reasonably possible change in any key assumptions will lead to a calculated recoverable amount that is lower than the carrying amount.\n\nAtlas Antibodies acquired two subsidiaries during 2021, significantly increasing the value of the company with a large part of the value consisting of goodwill. Lower sales and margins, mainly driven by weaker short- to medium-term outlook within the evitria business, have in 2023 resulted in a calculated value lower than the carrying amount of the net assets. Hence a write down of goodwill of SEK/uni202F800m has been recognized. The write down is reported in the Consolidated\n\nincome statement as an Administrative, research and development and other operating costs within the operating segment Patricia Industries. The view of the company's long-term potential remains intact.\n\nThe calculated value in use is primarily sensitive to changes in growth rate, EBITDA-margins and the discount factor. Sales growth is based on historical performance, expected market growth and planned strategic initiatives. Due to this year write down, the calculated value in use equals the carrying amount. All negative changes in assumptions and parameters will therefore result in the value in use being lower than the carrying amount.\n\n| 12/31 2023            | Amount of   goodwill, SEK m   | Amount of  tradenames, SEK m 1)   | Valuation method   | Budget for   | Financial   forecasts until   | Growth rate beyond  forecast period   | Discount rate   (pre tax)   |\n|-----------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Cash generating units |                               |                                   |                    |              |                               |                                       |                             |\n| M\u00f6lnlycke             | 24,443                        | 5,698                             | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 1.9                                   | 10.0                        |\n| Laborie               | 10,733                        | 580                               | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.5                                   | 10.1                        |\n| Sarnova               | 9,136                         | 929                               | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.4                                   | 10.1                        |\n| Piab                  | 5,590                         | 1,337                             | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.9                                   | 9.5                         |\n| Advanced Instruments  | 5,391                         | 596                               | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.9                                   | 10.1                        |\n| Permobil              | 3,939                         | 1,443                             | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.2                                   | 9.9                         |\n| BraunAbility          | 3,250                         | 344                               | Value in use       | 2024         | 2028                          | 2.1                                   | 10.1                        |\n| Atlas Antibodies      | 2,300                         | -

Fair value has been determined based on current market prices for comparable properties and by using a return model based on a calculation of the present value of future cash flows.\n\nThe discount rate has been estimated at 5.9/uni202Fpercent (6.0) and consists of an estimated inflation rate of 2/uni202Fpercent 2024 and onwards, a risk-free long-term real rate of interest and a risk premium. Payments for operations and maintenance have been assessed following the rate of inflation during the calculation period.\n\nThe residual value has been assessed by the long-term, normalized net operating income for the year after the calculation period divided by an estimated longterm yield. The long-term yield requirement has been assessed to be 3.9/uni202Fpercent (3.8). Value determined on an earnings basis nominal development during the calculation period will then be around 2/uni202Fpercent.\n\nAll valuations in level 3 are based on assumptions and judgments that management consider to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made. The valuation of owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model is dependent on the level of the discount rate and the long-term yield requirement. A 0.5/uni202Fpercentage point change of the discount rate would have an effect on the value of the owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model of SEK/uni202F50m (34). Respectively a 0.5/uni202Fpercentage point change of the long-term yield requirement would have an effect on the value of SEK/uni202F116m (81).\n\nAll properties were revalued during 2023.\n\n|

All investment property is measured using the fair value model. Changes in the fair value are recognized in profit/loss for the year.\n\nThe market value of each property is assessed individually by external valuers. The valuation method uses a 10-15 year cash flow analysis, based on the property's net operating income. Opening value-impacting factors, such as yield requirement, are assessed using the location-based pricing method. The location's market rental rate and long-term vacancy rate are also assessed.\n\nEach property is assessed using property-specific value-impacting events, such as newly signed and renegotiated lease agreements, terminated leases and investments. In estimating the fair value of the properties, the highest and best use of the properties is their current use. Changes to the unobservable inputs used in the valuations during the period are analyzed by management at each closing date against internally available information, information from completed and planned transactions and information from external sources. The valuation method therefore complies with Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy in IFRS 13.\n\n## Fair value measurement of Investment property\n\nThe discount rate has been estimated to be in a span of 6.1-9.11/uni202Fpercent (5.5-7.95) and consists of an estimated inflation rate of 2/uni202Fpercent 2024 and onwards, a riskfree long-term real rate of interest and a risk premium. Payments for operations and maintenance have been assessed following the rate of inflation during the calculation period.\n\nThe residual value has been assessed by the long-term, normalized net operating income for the year after the calculation period divided by an estimated long-term yield. The long-term yield requirement has been assessed to be in a span of 4.1-7.0/uni202Fpercent (3.4-5.75). Value determined on an earnings basis nominal development during the calculation period will then be around 2/uni202Fpercent.\n\nAll valuations in level 3 are based on assumptions and judgments that management consider to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made. The valuation of owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model is dependent on the level of the discount rate and the long-term yield requirement. A 0.5/uni202Fpercentage point change of the discount rate would have an effect on the value of the owner-occupied property recognized with the revaluation model of SEK/uni202F271m (451). Respectively a 0.5/uni202Fpercentage point change of the long-term yield requirement would have an effect on the value of SEK/uni202F331m (767).

The dividend is subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2024.\n\nThe dividend for 2022 amounted to SEK/uni202F13,478m (SEK/uni202F4.40 per share) and the dividend for 2021 amounted to 12,254m (SEK/uni202F4.00 per share).\n\nDividends paid out per share for 2022 and 2021 correspond to proposed dividend per share. Dividends are recognized as a liability as soon as the Annual General Meeting has approved the dividend for the year.\n\n## Capital management\n\nIn order to be able to act upon business opportunities at any point in time, it is vital for Investor to maintain financial flexibility. The Group's goal is to have leverage (net debt as a percentage of total adjusted assets) of 0-10/uni202Fpercent over an economic cycle. While leverage can fluctuate above and below the target level, it should not exceed 20/uni202Fpercent for a longer period of time. Investor's leverage at the beginning of the year was 1.5/uni202Fpercent and at the end of the year 1.7/uni202Fpercent. The change is mainly due to cash flows arising from dividends and divestmentsfrom Listed Companies, proceeds from sales within the operating segments Investments in EQT and Patricia Industries, investments within Listed Companies, Patricia Industries and EQT funds and dividends paid to shareholders. For more information, see the Administration report page 92.\n\nThe Group's total shareholder return objective (sum of the share price change and dividend) is to exceed the risk-free interest rate plus a risk premium, i.e. 8-9/uni202Fpercent. The total shareholder return for 2023 was 26/uni202Fpercent. Capital is defined as total recognized equity.\n\n| Equity                                             | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Attributable to shareholders of the Parent company | 716,768      | 604,865      |\n| Attributable to non-controlling interest           | 663          | 788          |\n| BS Total                                           | 717,431      | 605,653      |",

If assets in funded plans under perform this yield, it will increase the amount of deficit. Allocation of assets among different categories is important to reduce the portfolio risk. The time horizon for the investments is also an important factor.\n\n## Interest risks\n\nA decrease in corporate bond yields will increase the value of the defined benefit obligation for accounting purposes.\n\n## Longevity risk\n\nThe majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the plan member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## Salary risk\n\nThe majority of the obligations are to provide benefits for plan members based on annual salaries. If salaries increase faster than has been assumed, this will result in an increase in the defined benefit obligation.\n\n## Pension benefits\n\nEmployees in Group companies have various kinds of pension benefits. These benefits are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. In Sweden the total retirement benefit package is often a mixed solution with some parts being defined contribution pension plans and others being defined benefit pension plans. Salaried employees' plans comprise of the defined benefit plan ITP and the additional defined contribution plan ITPK.\n\nThe ITP plan is secured with the insurance company Alecta. Since the information provided by Alecta is not sufficient to be able to account for as a defined benefit plan, the Alecta plan has been reported as a defined contribution plan (multi-employer plan).\n\nThe ITP plan has contracts with a premium, where benefits continue unchanged until retirement. This means that premiums can not be changed to the policyholder's or the insured's disadvantage.\n\nThe Group operates defined contribution plans in Sweden, U.S., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand, Italy and France. The plans imply that the Group obtains pension insurances or makes payments to foundations.\n\n75/uni202Fpercent of the Group's defined benefit plans exist in Sweden. Other defined benefit plans exist in the U.S., Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Thailand, Italy and France. The plans in Belgium, the U.S. and the Netherlands are funded. In Sweden there are funded and unfunded plans and the plans in other countries are unfunded.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n| Assumptions for defined  benefit obligations 2023   | Sweden   | Other (weighted average)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Discount rate                                       | 4.1      | 4.1                        |\n| Future salary growth                                | 1.2      | 2.2                        |\n| Future pension growth                               | 2.0-2.4  | 0.8                        |\n| Mortality assumptions used                          | DUS23    | Local mortality tables     |\n\n| Assumptions for defined  benefit obligations 2022   | Sweden   | Other (weighted average)   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|----------|----------------------------|\n| Discount rate                                       | 4.1      | 3.6                        |\n| Future salary growth                                | 1.4      | 2.4                        |\n| Future pension growth                               | 2.0-2.8  | 0.9                        |\n| Mortality assumptions used                          | DUS21    | Local mortality tables     |\n\n## Basis used to determine the discount rate\n\nThe discount rate has been set separately for each country by reference to market rates on high quality corporate bonds with a duration and currency that is consistent with the duration and currency of the defined benefit obligation. This may involve interpolation of bond yield curves where there is no direct match for duration or the market is not deep for matching bond durations. The market for high quality Swedish mortgage backed bonds is considered to be deep and thereby fulfills the requirements of high quality corporate bonds according to IAS 19. Swedish mortgage backed bonds have therefore served as reference when determining the discount rate used for the calculation of the defined benefit obligations in Sweden. In countries where there is no deep market for high quality corporate bonds, government bonds are used as a reference when determining the discount rate.\n\n## Maturity profile of the defined benefit obligation\n\n| Maturity profile   |   0-3 year |   4-6 year |   7-15 year | Over 15 year   | Total   |\n|--------------------|------------|------------|-------------|----------------|---------|\n| Cash flows         |         89 |        142 |         478 | 1,643          | 2,352   |\n\n## Multi-employer plans\n\nThe Swedish ITP plan is secured with the insurance company Alecta, which is a mutual life insurance company, owned by its customers, i.e. businesses and their employees. The company form means that any surplus in operations is returned to the customers and the insured population is responsible for any deficit. For the fiscal year 2023 the Investor Group did not have access to information that would make it possible to recognize it as a defined benefit plan. The ITP pension plan secured through insurance from Alecta is therefore recognized as a defined contribution plan. The premium for the defined benefit pension plan is calculated individually and depends on salary, pension already earned and expected remaining period of service. For 2024, the Investor Group expect to pay SEK/uni202F13m for premiums to Alecta (13).\n\nA measure of the financial strength of a mutual insurance company is the collective funding ratio, which shows the relationship between the assets and the total insurance undertaking. The collective funding ratio measures distributable assets in relation to insurance commitments. The insurance commitment is comprised of guaranteed commitments and allocated rebates to the insured and policy holders, calculated according to Alecta's technical methods and assumptions, which differ from the methods and assumptions applied in the valuation of defined benefit pensions according to IAS 19.\n\nAccording to Alecta's consolidation policy for defined benefit insurance, the collective funding ratio is usually allowed to vary between 125 and 175/uni202Fpercent. With a low funding ratio, one measure to increase the ratio can be to increase the price of newly subscribed benefits and benefit increases. If the collective funding ratio exceeds 150/uni202Fpercent, the policyholder's premiums can be reduced. By the end of 2023 the surplus of the collective funding ratio in Alecta was preliminary 157 percent (172).",

Liabilities recognized in the Balance sheet include the following: loans, shares on loan, trade payables and derivatives.\n\nA purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized on the trade date, which is the date that an entity commits itself to purchase or sell an asset.\n\n## Classification and measurement\n\nFinancial instruments are allocated to different categories. For financial assets classification is based on the entity's business model for managing the financial asset and the characteristics of the contractual cash flows of the asset.\n\n## Financial assets\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit/loss Financial assets measured at fair value through profit/loss are divided into assets within a business model that are measured at fair value through profit/ loss and derivatives used in hedge accounting.\n\nFinancial assets, except derivatives used in hedge accounting, includes all share holdings within the Group. All financial investments and cash and cash equivalents within the liquidity portfolio are included here as well.\n\nDerivatives used in hedge accounting, consists of derivatives used in hedge accounting with a positive fair value. More information can be found under Derivatives on page 144.\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income\n\nThis category includes derivatives used in hedge accounting, that consists of derivatives used in hedge accounting with a positive fair value - cash flow hedges. More information can be found under Derivatives on page 144.\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nThis category mainly includes trade receivables, other short-term receivables and cash and cash equivalents in the subsidiaries within Patricia Industries. These assets are short-term in nature, which is why they are reported at nominal amounts without any discounting.\n\nA loss allowance is recognized for all financial assets classified as measured at amortized cost. For all these financial assets, except trade receivables, the loss allowance is calculated as 12 month expected losses or, if the credit risk for the financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition, as lifetime expected losses. The assessment is made every balance sheet day and if any contractual payments for a loan are more than 30 days past due, the credit risk is considered to have increased significantly since initial recognition.\n\nFor trade receivables a simplified approach is applied and a loss allowance based on lifetime expected credit losses are recorded. The deduction for defaulted debts are assessed on an individual basis, with an additional allowance for trade receivables that are not past due. This loss rate allowance reflects a three years history of credit losses and are calculated and reviewed regularly in order to reflect current conditions and forecasts about the future.\n\n## Financial liabilities\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit/loss Financial liabilities in this category includes derivatives with a negative value used in hedge accounting and derivatives not used in hedge accounting.\n\nThe latter relates to written put options that may result in Group companies receiving their own equity shares and being obligated to deliver cash corresponding to the fair value of the equity shares. Shares on loan in the trading operation are classified as financial liabilities held for sale. When shares on loan are sold, an amount corresponding to the fair value of the shares is recorded as a liability. This category also includes contingent considerations recognized in business combinations to which IFRS 3 applies.\n\nMore information about all derivatives can be found under Derivatives on page 144.\n\n## Financial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nThis category includes all other financial liabilities than those measured at fair value through profit/loss above.\n\n## Disclosures\n\nDisclosures regarding financial instruments can also be found in: note 3, Financial risks and risk management; note 13, Net financial items; note 21, Other financial investments, short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents; and note 27, Interest-bearing liabilities.",

Measurements of financial instruments at fair value\n\nFollowing is a description of the methods and assumptions used to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities shown in this Annual report. Changed conditions regarding the determination of fair value of financial instruments cause transfer between levels described below.\n\n## Measurements of financial instruments in level 1\n\nListed holdings\n\nListed holdings are valued on the basis of their share price (bid price, if there is one quoted) on the balance sheet date.\n\n## Measurements of financial instruments in level 2\n\nShares and participations\n\nShares and participations in level 2 consist of holdings in listed shares for which the classes are not actively traded. The measurement of these shares is based on the market price for the most traded class of shares for the same holding.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nDerivatives in level 2 consist mainly of currency and interest rate swaps for which the valuation is based on discounted future cash flows according to the terms and conditions in the agreement and based on relevant market data.\n\n## Measurement of financial instruments in level 3\n\nUnlisted holdings and fund holdings\n\nUnlisted holdings are measured on the basis of the 'International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines'.\n\nFor directly owned holdings (i.e. those owned directly by a company in the Investor Group), an overall evaluation is made to determine the measurement method that is appropriate for each specific holding. It is first taken into account whether a recent financing round or 'arm's length transaction' has been made. As a secondary measure, a valuation is made by applying relevant multiples to the holding's key ratios, derived from a relevant sample of comparable companies, with deduction for individually determined adjustments as a consequence of the size difference between the company being valued and the sample of comparable companies.\n\nUnlisted holdings in funds are measured at Investor's share of the value that the fund manager reports for all unlisted fund holdings (Net Asset Value) and is normally updated when a new valuation is received. If Investor's assessment is that the fund manager's valuation does not sufficiently take into account factors that affect the value of the underlying holdings, or if the valuation is considered to deviate considerably from IFRS principles, the value is adjusted.\n\nWhen estimating the fair value market conditions, liquidity, financial condition, purchase multiples paid in other comparable third-party transactions, the price of securities of other companies comparable to the portfolio company, and operating results and other financial data of the portfolio company are taken in consideration as applicable. Representatives from Investor's management participate actively in the valuation process within Investor Growth Capital (IGC) and evaluate the estimated fair values for holdings in IGC and the EQT funds in relation to their knowledge of the development of the portfolio companies and the market. Listed holdings in funds are measured in the same way as listed holdings, as described on the next page.",

The financial instruments are categorized on three levels, depending on how the fair value is measured:\n\nLevel 1: According to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical instruments Level 2: According to directly or indirectly observable inputs that are not included in level 1 Level 3: According to inputs that are unobservable in the market\n\n## Financial assets and liabilities

No transfers have been made between level 1 and 2.\n\nAll valuations in level 3 are based on assumptions and judgments that management consider to be reasonable based on the circumstances prevailing at the time. Changes in assumptions may result in adjustments to reported values and the actual outcome may differ from the estimates and judgments that were made.\n\nShares and participations in level 3 are mainly fund investments within EQT. Unlisted holdings in funds are measured at Investor's share of the value that the fund manager reports for all unlisted fund holdings (Net Asset Value) and is normally updated when a new valuation is received. The value change on Investor's investments in EQT funds are reported with a one-quarter lag.\n\nPart of the unlisted portfolio within Financial Investments is valued based on comparable companies, and the value is dependent on the level of the multiples. The multiple ranges provided in the note show the minimum and maximum value of the actual multiples applied in these valuations.\n\nA 10/uni202Fpercent change of the multiples would have an effect on this part of the unlisted portfolio of approximately SEK/uni202F155m (200). For the derivatives, a parallel shift of the interest rate curve by one percentage point would affect the value by approximately SEK/uni202F600m (660).\n\nIn other long-term and current liabilities, the fair value of issued put options over non-controlling interest are included with SEK/uni202F8,708m (6,306). Fair value for these liabilities is to a large extent based on the estimated market values for the respective major subsidiary within Patricia Industries, for which put options to non-controlling interest have been issued. The methodology for calculating estimated market values is presented together with Alternative Performance Measures on page 166. Important unobservable input that has been used for each subsidiary are presented on page 8 in the Year-End Report for Investor for 2023.\n\n## Changes of financial assets and liabilities in level

Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value through profit/loss, which means that transaction costs are charged to profit/loss for the period. In the following periods, the derivative instrument is recognized at fair value and changes in the value are recognized in the Income statement as income or expense (part of operating profit) or as part of net financial items. Where they are reported is based on the purpose of the derivative and whether its use is related to an operating item or a financial item. The interest rate coupon from an interest rate swap is recognized as interest and value changes are recognized as other financial items as a component of financial net, provided that the interest rate swap is not part of a cash flow hedge, which is accounted for according to the description below. Disclosures related to derivatives can also be found in note 3, Financial risks and risk management.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nInvestor applies hedge accounting in order to reduce fluctuations in profit/loss related to hedging of interest rate risks and currency risks. When hedge accounting is applied, value changes related to the hedging instrument is presented in profit/loss at the same time as the result from the hedged item. The effective part of the hedge is presented in the same component of the income statement as the hedged item. Hedging instruments with a positive fair value are in the Consolidated balance sheet reported within the balance sheet items current and long-term receivables respectively. Hedging instruments with a negative fair value are in the Consolidated balance sheet reported within the balance sheet items current and long-term liabilities respectively.\n\nHedging of interest rate and exchange rate risks - fair value hedges In some cases, the Group uses derivatives as hedging instruments for different types of financial risks connected with the Group's external borrowing.\n\nFor example, a fixed rate loan in foreign currency can be swapped to floating rate SEK with foreign currency interest rate swaps. The loan's credit spread component on initial recognition is not included in the hedging relationship.\n\nThe so-called FX basis spread is defined as a hedging cost and is not part of the hedge either. The market value of the hedging instrument relating to basis spread is instead accounted for in equity.\n\nAs long as hedge accounting is applied, the carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted for fair value changes attributable to the risk being hedged, and those fair value changes are recognized in profit/loss. The hedging instrument is measured at fair value, with changes in fair value also recognized in profit/loss.\n\nHedging of the Group's interest rate exposure - cash flow hedges In some cases Investor uses interest rate swaps to control the exposure to variability in cash flows of future interest rate fluctuations for loans with a variable interest rate. In the Balance sheet, interest rate swaps are valued at fair value. The interest rate coupon is recognized on an on-going basis in the Income statement as a component of interest expense. Unrealized changes to the fair value of interest rate swaps are recognized in Other comprehensive income and are included as a component of the hedging reserve until the hedged item has an effect on the Income statement and as long as the criteria for hedge accounting and effectiveness are met.\n\n## Hedging instruments together with hedged items and derivatives without hedge

A provision is recognized if and only if a present obligation (legal or constructive) has arisen as a result of a past event (the obligating event), the payment is probable (more likely than not), and the amount can be estimated reliably.\n\n| Pledged assets                                                    | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| In the form of pledged securities for  liabilities and provisions |              |              |\n| Real estate mortgages                                             | 4,572        | 1,782        |\n| Shares etc. 1)                                                    | 27,197       | 27,979       |\n| Other pledged and equivalent collateral                           |              |              |\n| Bank Guarantee                                                    | 3            | 3            |\n| Total pledged assets                                              | 31,772       | 29,764       |\n\n1) Pledged shares for loans in subsidiaries.\n\n| Contingent liabilities             | 12/31 2023   | 12/31 2022   |\n|------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|\n| Guarantees on behalf of associates | 2,440        | 2,440        |\n| Other contingent liabilities       | 2,314        | 1,616        |\n| Total contingent liabilities       | 4,754        | 4,056        |\n\nOther contingent liabilities consist of warranties within the wholly-owned subsidiaries.\n\nThe credit facilities within the wholly-owned subsidiaries are subject to financial covenants.\n\n## Note 34: Related party transactions\n\nThe following additional information about related parties is being provided in addition to what has been reported in other notes to the financial statements.\n\n## Relations with related parties\n\nThe Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation has significant influence over Investor (in accordance with the definition in IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures) and therefore a related party relationship (see Other related party in the table). Investor has also a related party relationship with its subsidiaries and associated companies.\n\n## Companies with common board members\n\nIn addition to the above-noted relations with related parties, there are a number of companies in which Investor and the company have common board members. Since these situations do not imply influence of the type described in IAS 24, information has not been provided in this note.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nTransactions with related parties are priced according to market terms, for information about the Parent company see note P18, Related party transactions. The Audit and Risk Committee oversees the procedures for related-party transactions. The Committee has also implemented a pre-approval process for non-audit services carried out by the external auditor.\n\n## With key management personnel\n\nSee note 11, Employees and personnel costs for information about salaries and other compensation, costs and commitments regarding pensions and similar benefits, and severance payment agreements for the board, President and other senior executives.\n\n## Investment programs\n\nSelected senior staff and other senior executives within Patricia Industries have had the opportunity for a number of years to make parallel investments to some extent with Investor. The Carried interest plans created within the former Investor Growth Capital (IGC), are designed in accordance with market practice in the venture capital market and provide an economic incentive for managers and encourage personal commitment to analysis and investment work since the result is directly connected to the financial performance of the business. Carried interest plans are linked to realized growth in the value of holdings, after deduction for costs, seen as a portfolio.\n\nDuring the year there have been no payments to senior staff within Investor from these programs (SEK -m). At year-end there were no provision on unrealized gains to senior staff (SEK -m). Previous years expensed amounts were reported in the item 'Changes in Value' in the Income Statement.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\nIn January 2023, Vectura and Saab entered into a share purchase agreement and a lease agreement for new premises. Vectura shall produce and finance a new construction project with premises adapted for Saab. Access to the premises is expected by the end of 2025. The lease agreement has an initial term of 20 years. The total net present value of the transaction amounted to approximately SEK/uni202F610m.\n\n## Related party transactions\n\n|                               | Associates   | Associates   | Other related party   | Other related party   |\n|-------------------------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|\n|                               | 2023         | 2022         | 2023                  | 2022                  |\n| Sales of products/services    | 6            | 7            | 12                    | 11                    |\n| Purchase of products/services | 22           | 11           |                       |                       |\n| Financial expenses            | 664          | 363          |                       |                       |\n| Financial income              | 79           | 53           |                       |                       |\n| Dividend received             | 6,978        | 6,680        |                       |                       |\n| Dividend paid                 | -            | -            | 2,709                 | 2,456                 |\n| Receivables                   | 2,557        | 4,689        | 1                     | 0                     |\n| Liabilities                   | 8,344        | 10,153       | 2                     | 3                     |\n\n## Note 35: Subsequent events\n\nNo company specific events have occurred subsequent to the reporting period.",

It is a Swedish limited company domiciled in Stockholm, Sweden. The address of the registered office is SE-103 32 Stockholm, Sweden. Visiting address Hamn gatan/uni202F15. Investor is an engaged owner of high-quality, global companies and have a longterm investment perspective.\n\nThe Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2 Accounting for Legal Entities has been applied for the Parent company. The Parent company applies the same accounting policies as the Group unless otherwise noted. Any differences between the accounting policies of the Parent company and those of the Group are caused by limitations to the application of IFRS in the Parent company because of the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Significant accounting policies for the Parent company that differs from the Group are presented in this note. Other significant accounting policies are presented in note 1, Significant accounting policies and in connection to respective note to the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Subsidiaries\n\nSubsidiaries are companies in which Investor AB is able to exert a controlling influence. Controlling influence is the power to, either directly or indirectly, govern the financial and operating policies of an entity in order to obtain economic benefits from its activities.\n\nIn the Parent company, participations in Group companies are recognized in accordance with the cost method and in legal entities, transaction costs attributable to business combinations will be included in the acquisition cost.\n\nContingent consideration is valued based on the likelihood that the consideration will be paid. Any changes to the provision/receivable result in an increase/ decrease in the cost of acquisition. On each balance sheet date, the carrying amounts are reviewed to determine if there are any indications of impairment. Dividends from subsidiaries are included in the Parent company's operating profit/loss.\n\n## Shareholders' contribution\n\nShareholders' contributions are recognized directly in equity by the receiver and are capitalized in Participations in group companies by the giver to the extent that no impairment loss is required.\n\n## Associates\n\nBased on how Investor controls and monitors the companies' operations, Participations in associates are recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 9. For further information see note 20, Shares and participations in associates.\n\n## Borrowing costs\n\nIn the Parent company, borrowing costs are charged to profit/loss during the period they pertain to. Borrowing costs are not capitalized.\n\n## Financial guarantees\n\nThe Parent company's financial guarantee contracts consist primarily of guarantees on behalf of subsidiaries and associates.\n\nThe Parent company applies RFR 2 IFRS 9 item 1, to account for financial guarantee contracts issued on behalf of associates, which is somewhat more lenient than the rules in IFRS 9, due to the relationship between accounting and taxation. The Parent company recognizes financial guarantee contracts as a provision in the Balance sheet when the company has a commitment for which payment will most likely be required.\n\n## Tax regulation\n\nThe Parent company is taxed in accordance with the Swedish rules for certain holding companies. The purpose of these rules is to allow reallocations of its holdings without tax consequences. To be eligible for these rules, the company should, almost exclusively, manage an equity portfolio providing the shareholders risk allocation. The regulations for industrial holding companies imply that capital gains on shares are not taxable and corresponding capital losses are non-deductible. Dividends received and interest income are both taxable items, while administrative costs, interest expenses and dividend paid are all deductible. Moreover, the Parent company declares a standard income of 1.5/uni202Fpercent on the market value of listed shares when the voting rights at the beginning of the year are less than 10/uni202Fpercent, or when they exceed 10/uni202Fpercent but, at the beginning of the year, had been owned for less than one year. As a consequence of these tax regulations, the Parent company typically does not pay income tax. For the same reason, the Parent company does not report deferred tax attributable to temporary differences. The regulations for industrial holding companies also imply that the Parent company may neither give nor receive Group contributions.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Parent company applies RFR 2 IFRS 16 item 1, and therefore recognize leases in the Income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\n## Note P2: Operating costs\n\n## Personnel\n\nExpensed wages, salaries and other remunerations amounted to SEK/uni202F332m (303), of which social costs SEK/uni202F66m (59). The average number of employees at yearend were 78 (76). For more information see note 11, Employees and personnel costs on page 112.\n\n## Auditor's fees and expenses\n\n| Auditor in charge      |   2023 Deloitte |   2022 Deloitte |\n|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------|\n| Auditing assignment    |               2 |               2 |\n| Other audit activities |               3 |               0 |\n| Other assignments      |               0 |               0 |\n| Total                  |               6 |               2 |\n\n## Leases\n\n| Non-cancellable future lease payments    | 2023   | 2022   |\n|------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Less than 1 year from balance sheet date | 29     | 28     |\n| 1-5 years from balance sheet date        | -      | 8      |\n| Total                                    | 29     | 36     |\n| Costs for the year                       |        |        |\n| Minimum lease payments                   | 18     | 16     |\n| Total                                    | 18     | 16     |\n\nLease contracts are mainly related to rental agreement for office building.\n\n## Note P3: Results from other receivables that are non-current assets\n\n|                                      | 2023   | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Interest income from group companies | 1,171  | 968    |\n| Changes in value                     | -90    | -380   |\n| Other interest income                | -      | 6      |\n| Exchange rate differences            | -664   | 773    |\n| IS Total                             | 418    | 1,367  |",

No dividend is paid for the Parent company's holding of own shares, whose exact number is determined on the record date for cash payment of the dividend. On December 31, 2023, the Parent company's holding of own shares totaled 5,799,815. The proposed dividend is proposed to be paid in two installments, with SEK/uni202F3.60 per share in May, 2024 and SEK/uni202F1.20 per share in November, 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors and the President certify that the consolidated accounts and annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards in Regulation (EC) No. 1606/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 19, 2002 on the application of international accounting standards and generally accepted accounting standards in Sweden and give a true and fair view of the Group's and Parent company's financial position and results of operations. The Administration report for the Group and the Parent company gives a true and fair view of the operations, position and results, and describes significant risks and uncertainty factors that the Parent company and Group companies face. The annual accounts and the consolidated financial statements were approved for release by the Board of Directors and the President in March, 2024. The consolidated income statement and balance sheet, and the\n\nincome statement and balance sheet of the Parent company, will be presented for adoption by the Annual General Meeting on May 7, 2024.\n\nThe proposed dividend amounts to SEK/uni202F14,730m. The Group's equity attributable to the shareholders of the Parent company was SEK/uni202F716,768m as of December 31, 2023, and unrestricted equity in the Parent company was SEK/uni202F508,178m. Unrestricted equity includes SEK/uni202F435,203m attributable to unrealized changes in value according to a valuation at fair value. With reference to the above, and to other information that has come to the knowledge of the board, it is the opinion of the board that the proposed dividend is defendable with reference to the demands that the nature, scope and risks of Investor's operations place on the size of the company's and the Group's equity, and the company's and the Group's consolidation needs, liquidity and position in general.\n\nStockholm, March, 2024\n\nJacob Wallenberg\n\nChair\n\n| Marcus Wallenberg     | Gunnar Brock   | Magdalena Gerger   | Tom Johnstone, CBE      |\n|-----------------------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|\n| Vice Chair            | Director       | Director           | Director                |\n| Isabelle Kocher       |                | Sara \u00d6hrvall       | Sven Nyman              |\n| Director              |                | Director           | Director                |\n| Grace Reksten Skaugen |                | Hans Str\u00e5berg      | Johan Forssell          |\n| Director              |                | Director           | President and           |\n|                       |                |                    | Chief Executive Officer |\n\nOur Audit Report was submitted in March, 2024\n\nDeloitte AB\n\nJonas St\u00e5hlberg\n\nAuthorized Public Accountant",

The annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the company are included on pages 7, 14-27, 53-69, 70-85, 89-92 and 95-158 in this document.\n\nIn our opinion, the annual accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the parent company as of 31 December 2023 and its financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act. The consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the group as of 31 December 2023 and their financial performance and cash flow for the year then ended in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the EU, and the Annual Accounts Act. Our opinions do not cover the corporate governance statement on pages 57-69 and the statutory sustainability report on pages 19-23, 53-56 and 70-85. The statutory administration report is consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nWe therefore recommend that the general meeting of shareholders adopts the income statement and balance sheet for the parent company and the group.\n\nOur opinions in this report on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts are consistent with the content of the additional report that has been submitted to the parent company's audit committee in accordance with the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 11.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISA) and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. This includes that, based on the best of our knowledge and belief, no prohibited services referred to in the Audit Regulation (537/2014) Article 5.1 have been provided to the audited company or, where applicable, its parent company or its controlled companies within the EU.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nKey audit matters of the audit are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of, and in forming our opinion thereon, the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole, but we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## Governance over financial reporting\n\nThe companies within Patricia Industries are independent with separate internal control systems in place for their operating activities as well as processes for financial reporting.\n\nOur audit focused on the internal governance over financial reporting for several reasons. Firstly, it is important to ensure that the information reported by each entity is prepared in accordance with IFRS. Secondly, it is important to have well established procedures to ensure timely and correct financial reporting. Thirdly, monitoring controls are important to ensure high quality reporting.\n\nInvestor's information regarding the principles applied for its consolidated financial statements are included in Note 1 Significant accounting policies and in Note 20 Shares and participation in associates further explanation on the method for accounting for associates is provided.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating Investor's processes relating to internal controls over financial reporting and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 evaluating relevant internal controls in relation to critical IT-systems used for financial reporting,\n- \u00b7 evaluating Investor's monitoring controls over financial information reported from consolidated subsidiaries and associates reported under the equity method.\n\n## Valuation of listed and unlisted investments\n\nInvestor group's carrying value of listed investments amounted to SEK/uni202F625 882 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWe focused on the listed investments since the carrying value is significant, there is a risk that changes in ownership might not be properly recognized, and effects of dividend received might not be properly reflected in the carrying value. Investor's principles for accounting for listed investments, disclosures regarding the investments and description of measurement of financial instruments are included in Note 32 Financial instruments.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the valuation process and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 validating the holdings towards external statements,\n- \u00b7 validating the fair value calculation arithmetically and comparing values to official share prices,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the adequacy of disclosures relating to valuation of listed investments to ensure compliance with IFRS.\n\nInvestor group's carrying value of unlisted investments recognized at fair value amounted to SEK/uni202F34 744 million as of December 31, 2023. Investor's valuation policy is based on IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines. Inappropriate judgements made in the assessment of fair value could have a significant impact on the value of the unlisted investment.\n\nWe focused on the unlisted investments since the carrying value is material, the investment portfolio comprises a large number of unlisted securities and since the assessments made to arrive at the fair value is sensitive to judgements and estimates made.\n\nInvestor's principles for accounting for unlisted investments, disclosures regarding these investments and description of measurement of financial instruments are included in Note 32 Financial instruments.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating the valuation process and testing of relevant controls,\n- \u00b7 validating correct ownership percentages in and proper accounting for changes in such ownership,\n- \u00b7 validating that the methodology applied in the valuation of the portfolio companies is in accordance with IFRS 13 and the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines,\n- \u00b7 evaluating the adequacy of disclosures relating to valuation of unlisted investments to ensure compliance with IFRS.\n\n## Valuation of goodwill\n\nInvestor's acquisitions of M\u00f6lnlycke, Permobil, BraunAbility, Laborie, Sarnova, Piab, Advanced Instruments and Atlas Antibodies have led to a portion of the purchase price being allocated to intangible assets including goodwill. Changes in economic conditions or lower than expected development of performance may be indicators of potential impairment of the recoverable amount of these assets and hence the consolidated net asset value of Investor. The total carrying amount of goodwill relating to these holdings amounted to SEK/uni202F64 782 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nWe focused on the assessments of the carrying value for the holdings above since value of goodwill is material and as the assessment of the recoverable amount may be sensitive to changes in assumptions. Investor's disclosures regarding intangible assets are included in Note 16 Intangible assets, which specifically explains key assumptions used in the assessment of the recoverable amounts.\n\nOur audit procedures included, but were not limited to:\n\n- \u00b7 evaluating of management's annual process for impairment test of the carrying goodwill value,\n- \u00b7 validating the valuations and financial development of each entity and discussing historical performance with management,",

The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for this other information.\n\nOur opinion on the annual accounts and consolidated accounts does not cover this other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion regarding this other information.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, our responsibility is to read the information identified above and consider whether the information is materially inconsistent with the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. In this procedure we also take into account our knowledge otherwise obtained in the audit and assess whether the information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nIf we, based on the work performed concerning this information, conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the preparation of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and that they give a fair presentation in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act and, concerning the consolidated accounts, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of annual accounts and consolidated accounts that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, The Board of Directors and the Managing Director are responsible for the assessment of the company's and the group's ability to continue as a going concern. They disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting is however not applied if the Board of Directors and the Managing Director intends to liquidate the company, to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\nThe Audit Committee shall, without prejudice to the Board of Director's responsibilities and tasks in general, among other things oversee the company's financial reporting process.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the annual accounts and consolidated accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinions. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guar-\n\nantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts is located at the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors website: www.revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description forms part of the auditor's report.\n\n## Report on other legal and regulatory requirements\n\n## Opinions\n\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also audited the administration of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director of Investor AB (publ) for the financial year 2023-01-01 - 2023-12-31 and the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss.\n\nWe recommend to the general meeting of shareholders that the profit to be appropriated in accordance with the proposal in the statutory administration report and that the members of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director be discharged from liability for the financial year.\n\n## Basis for Opinions\n\nWe conducted the audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities section. We are independent of the parent company and the group in accordance with professional ethics for accountants in Sweden and have otherwise fulfilled our ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinions.\n\n## Responsibilities of the Board of Directors and the Managing Director\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the proposal for appropriations of the company's profit or loss. At the proposal of a dividend, this includes an assessment of whether the dividend is justifiable considering the requirements which the company's and the group's type of operations, size and risks place on the size of the parent company's and the group's equity, consolidation requirements, liquidity and position in general.\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the company's organization and the administration of the company's affairs. This includes among other things continuous assessment of the company's and the group's financial situation and ensuring that the company's organization is designed so that the accounting, management of assets and the company's financial affairs otherwise are controlled in a reassuring manner. The Managing Director shall manage the ongoing administration according to the Board of Directors' guidelines and instructions and among other matters take measures that are necessary to fulfill the company's accounting in accordance with law and handle the management of assets in a reassuring manner.\n\n## Auditor's responsibility\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the administration, and thereby our opinion about discharge from liability, is to obtain audit evidence to assess with a reasonable degree of assurance whether any member of the Board of Directors or the Managing Director in any material respect:\n\n- \u00b7 has undertaken any action or been guilty of any omission which can give rise to liability to the company, or\n- \u00b7 in any other way has acted in contravention of the Companies Act, the Annual Accounts Act or the Articles of Association.\n\nOur objective concerning the audit of the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss, and thereby our opinion about this, is to assess with reasonable degree of assurance whether the proposal is in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden will always detect actions or omissions that can give rise to liability to the company, or that the proposed appropriations of the company's profit or loss are not in accordance with the Companies Act.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the management's administration is located at the Swedish Inspectorate of Auditors website: www. revisorsinspektionen.se/revisornsansvar. This description forms part of the auditor's report.\n\n## The auditor's examination of the Esef report\n\n## Opinion\n\nIn addition to our audit of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts, we have also examined that the Board of Directors and the Managing Director have prepared the annual accounts and consolidated accounts in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting (the Esef report) pursuant to Chapter 16, Section 4 a of the Swedish Securities Market Act (2007:528) for Investor AB (publ) for the financial year 2023-01-01 - 2023-12-31.\n\nOur examination and our opinion relate only to the statutory requirements.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the Esef report.\n\nThe firm applies International Standard on Quality Management 1, which requires the firm to design, implement and operate a system of quality management including policies or procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nThe examination involves obtaining evidence, through various procedures, that the Esef report has been prepared in a format that enables uniform electronic reporting of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement in the report, whether due to fraud or error. In carrying out this risk assessment, and in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, the auditor considers those elements of internal control that are relevant to the preparation of the Esef report by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on\n\nthe effectiveness of those internal controls. The examination also includes an evaluation of the appropriateness and reasonableness of assumptions made by the Board of Directors and the Managing Director.\n\nThe procedures mainly include a validation that the Esef report has been prepared in a valid XHMTL format and a reconciliation of the Esef report with the audited annual accounts and consolidated accounts.\n\nFurthermore, the procedures also include an assessment of whether the consolidated statement of financial performance, financial position, changes in equity, cash flow and disclosures in the Esef report have been marked with iXBRL in accordance with what follows from the Esef regulation.\n\n## The auditor's examination of the corporate governance statement\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the corporate governance statement on pages 57-69 and that it has been prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nOur examination of the corporate governance statement is conducted in accordance with FAR's auditing standard RevU 16 The auditor's examination of the corporate governance statement. This means that our examination of the corporate governance statement is different and substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing and generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden.

Disclosures in accordance with chapter 6 section 6 the second paragraph points 2-6 of the Annual Accounts Act and chapter 7 section 31 the second paragraph the same law are consistent with the other parts of the annual accounts and consolidated accounts and are in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\n## The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the statutory sustainability report on pages 19-23, 53-56 and 70-85 and that it is prepared in accordance with the Annual Accounts Act.\n\nOur examination has been conducted in accordance with FAR:s auditing standard RevR 12 The auditor's opinion regarding the statutory sustainability report.

This supplementary, non-GAAP information also increases the consistency between the valuation of Listed Companies and our major wholly-owned subsidiaries and partner-owned Three Scandinavia.\n\nEstimated market values\n\nWhile the estimated market values might not necessarily reflect our view of the intrinsic values, they reflect how the stock market values similar companies.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe estimated market values are mainly based on valuation multiples, typically Enter- prise value (EV)/Last 12 months' operating profit, for relevant listed peers and indices. While we focus on EBITA when evaluating the performance of our companies, for valuation purposes, EBITDA multiples are more commonly available, and therefore often used. From the estimated EV, net debt is deducted, and the remaining equity value is multiplied with Patricia Industries' share of capital.\n\nAdjustments\n\nOperating profit is adjusted to reflect, for example, pro forma effects of completed add-on acquisitions and certain non-recurring items. An item is only viewed as non-recurring if it exceeds a certain amount set for each company, is unlikely to affect the company again, and does not result in any future benefit or cost. Acquisitions made less than 18 months ago are valued at the invested amount.",
