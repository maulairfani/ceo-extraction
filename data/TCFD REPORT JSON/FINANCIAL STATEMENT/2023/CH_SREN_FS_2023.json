        "page_content": "## The global economy and financial markets\n\n## Year in review\n\nWorld real gross domestic product (GDP) growth outperformed expectations in 2023, in spite of numerous geopolitical and macro challenges. Disinflation is underway, but continued economic strength has kept labour markets tight, keeping wage growth above the historical trend. A strong jobs market and robust consumer spending saw the S&P 500 rise 24.2% in 2023. The rapid interest rate hiking cycle continued into its second year, pushing yields on government bonds to multi-decade peaks in the autumn.\n\n## Global economic growth\n\nGlobal real GDP growth was stronger than expected in 2023, staying relatively stable at 2.6% compared with 3.1% in 2022. In the US, ongoing economic resilience was based largely on consumer spending and a lower impact of monetary policy than anticipated. In Europe, government support measures to combat the energy crisis, notably at the start of the year, helped consumers weather the ongoing cost of living crisis.\n\nAdvanced economies once again grew at a slower rate (1.6%) than emerging markets (3.9%). The US was a pillar of strength, avoiding a technical recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - and with full-year real GDP growth stronger in 2023 (2.5%) than in 2022 (2.1%). The euro area, on aggregate, narrowly avoided a technical recession in the face of cyclical and structural headwinds.\n\nEmerging market GDP growth, excluding the contribution from China, was 3.0% in 2023 in real terms, down from 4.1% in 2022. India outperformed among major emerging markets, with real growth of 6.7%. Brazil continued to grow solidly at 2.9% in 2023, the economy having rebounded in 2021-2022. Growth in China disappointed due to weak domestic and external demand, and a downturn in the property market. Nevertheless, large government interventions kept the economy growing at 5.2%, in line with the target.\n\n## Inflation\n\nHeadline inflation rates eased in 2023 as global energy and food prices came off the peaks seen in 2022. Still, the outbreak of conflict in the Middle East, together with oil production cuts and tensions in the Red Sea, kept energy prices front of mind. Core consumer inflation measures, which strip out the more volatile energy and food components, proved more resilient, peaking only in 2023 rather than the previous year. Strong labour markets kept wage growth high, adding to inflation pressures, particularly in service sectors.\n\nIn the US, the softening of the extremely hot labour market and cooling in real estate rentals saw Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation average 4.1% in 2023, down from 8.0% in the prior year. In the euro area, inflation was more persistent due to the longer duration of wage contracts than in the US, but the easing of global supply chains and strong reverse base effects from lower energy prices saw headline inflation come down to 5.4% (versus 8.4% in 2022).\n\nThere was significant disinflation in Latin America, except in Argentina, where price gains continued to accelerate into year end. In emerging Asian markets, more conservative fiscal policy and geographical distance from the larger geopolitical shocks kept inflation lower than global averages. Inflation in China stood at just 0.2% in 2023 on weak domestic demand. In Japan, inflation averaged 3.2% over the course of 2023 versus 2.5% in 2022.",

        "page_content": "## Interest rates\n\nIn the second year of the steepest and largest interest rate hiking cycle in decades, policy rates in 2023 climbed to levels last seen before the global financial crisis as central banks sought to tame rampant inflation. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) raised policy rates by 100 basis points (bps) in 2023, keeping interest rates steady at 5.375% after their final hike in July. The European Central Bank (ECB) hiked rates by twice as much over the course of the year and also launched its quantitative tightening policy, with the refinancing rate reaching 4.5% in September. The rate hike cycle in major advanced markets appears to be over. Central banks will now likely look for evidence of inflation returning to target, and of the pass-through of higher rates to the real economy. One potential exception to the end of the rate hike cycle in 2023 in major advanced markets is Australia, where the Reserve Bank followed a 'stop-start' approach, resuming interest rate hikes on two occasions after initially pausing in between meetings during the year.\n\nEmerging economies have demonstrated greater divergence on interest rates compared to the advanced markets, with central banks across several continents already cutting rates. Brazil, China and Poland have all begun to lower rates amid improving inflation outlooks. Meanwhile,\n\nSouth Africa and Mexico ended the year on hold, and Turkey and Russia were raising rates.\n\nLonger-dated advanced market sovereign bond yields moved notably higher in both nominal and real terms over the first three quarters of 2023 and peaked at multi-year highs in the autumn. Bond market volatility was extremely high versus historical averages in 2023. In October, the US 10-year Treasury hit 5.0% for the first time since 2007. In the UK, 10-year gilt yields surpassed those seen in the pension fund crisis in 2022. Bond yields, however, retreated into the year-end on faster disinflation and increased expectations for broader central bank interest rate cuts in 2024. A notable development in 2023 was the Japanese central bank easing its long-held yield curve control (YCC) policy in July.\n\n## Stock market performance\n\nThe S&P 500 yielded a price return of 24.2% in 2023, after the 19.9% decline in 2022. Equities rallied through to July, with technology stocks leading the way, spurred by hopes around the potential of artificial intelligence. Then, stronger-than-expected economic growth, particularly in the US, led stock markets to decline over the summer over concerns that central banks would be forced to raise interest rates higher than\n\n## Stock markets 2019-2023, indexed 100 = January 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Swiss Re Institute\n\npreviously thought in order to tame inflation. Stocks picked up the pace again from October to the year end as lower inflation readings and signs of a soft landing - an environment where both inflation and economic growth slow, but recession is avoided - made interest rate cuts in 2024 more likely.\n\nStock market volatility was lower in 2023 than in 2022, but there were nonetheless notable moves. Events in 2023 included a regional banking crisis in the US and the failing of Credit Suisse. The resulting market volatility spurred interventions of the respective central banks and government bodies amid fears of contagion in the broader banking system. The suspension of the US debt ceiling and outbreak of the conflict in the Middle East also created short-term volatility. At the same time, markets had to digest a net reduction in liquidity as central banks continued to shrink their balance sheets.\n\nAmong advanced markets, in the US the S&P 500 had a strong annual performance, on par with European equities (Euro Stoxx 50 +19.2%, FTSE 100 +3.8%) in local currency terms. Emerging markets stock performance varied (MSCI EM +7.0%, Shanghai Composite Index -3.7%).\n\n## Currency movements\n\nEuropean currencies strengthened against the US dollar in 2023, including sterling (+6.0%), the euro (+3.5%) and the Swiss franc (+9.9%). The dollar weakened in the first half of the year on domestic growth concerns and narrowing yield differentials, but outperformed in the second due to much stronger-than-expected GDP readings in the US and higher real yields relative to advanced market peers. The currency peaked in October before weakening into the year end on rising confidence that the US rate hiking cycle is over, and expectations of Fed rate cuts in 2024. 100 150 200\n\n50\n\nIn Asia, the Japanese yen weakened to 150 per US dollar in November after the Bank of Japan announced tweaks to its YCC policy. The Chinese renminbi was weighed down by the divergence between the Fed and the People's Bank of China monetary policy stance, a large differential in growth outlooks and weak external demand. 2020 2019",

        "page_content": "## Outlook\n\n## Year ahead economic outlook\n\nThe world economy will likely slow in 2024 as the lagged impacts of monetary policy tightening continue to accumulate. However, outlooks diverge across the major economies: the US is likely to continue to outperform, slowing only in the second half of the year, while the euro area enters 2024 with a stagnant outlook, with a recovery expected to begin in the second half of the year. China, meanwhile, is grappling with structural domestic growth challenges despite large government interventions. Swiss Re forecasts belowtrend global real GDP growth in 2024 of 2.4% before a rebound to 2.7% in 2025, the latter supported by lower inflation and interest rates.\n\nInflation is likely to remain volatile in the advanced markets and remain above target in 2024. CPI inflation is expected to moderate in both 2024 and 2025 in advanced markets.\n\nAdvanced market central banks are set to begin to ease monetary policy, but interest rates are likely to remain in restrictive territory in 2024. A sharp rise in long-term US sovereign bond yields in the autumn of 2023 signalled a shift out of the low interest rate environment which had endured since the Great Financial Crisis.\n\n## Long-term outlook: the 'four Ds'\n\nThe key structural factors affecting the long-term economic outlook remain the '4Ds': Divergence, Digitalisation, Decarbonisation and Debt. Governments will have to balance the need for investment in decarbonisation and digitalisation with growing debt sustainability concerns. This is especially true as economies slow in 2024, thereby reducing tax revenue, and as interest rates remain higher than over the past decade, increasing the cost of debt repayments. With advanced market government initiatives supporting sectors in their efforts to onshore, reshore or friendshore, divergence could further stress fiscal deficits. Divergence, decarbonisation and debt could also add to structurally higher inflation, while digitalisation could alleviate some of the price pressures.\n\nGeopolitics will likely play a dominant role in 2024. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has added new, potentially nonlinear, downside risks to the outlook, whereby energy price shocks have knock-on spiralling effects throughout the global economy. At the same time, the conflict in Ukraine enters its third year, and key elections in many countries, including in the US, add uncertainty to the outlook.",

Non-life insurance ranges from motor to property, specialty, personal accident, health and liability insurance. Health insurance accounts for about 47% of total non-life premiums; commercial property and casualty (P&C) about 25% and personal P&C about 28%.\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global non-life insurance premiums written increased by 3.7% year-on-year in inflation-adjusted (real) terms in 2023, above the 3.1% average annual growth from 2018-2022. Challenging economic conditions weighed on demand for insurance in 2023, primarily the high inflation rates in many economies, which again put pressure on consumers' purchasing power. This was more than offset by strong insurance price growth, in particular in personal lines. Elevated inflation also increased the value of exposures in 2023, which positively impacted premium growth.\n\nPersonal insurance outperformed commercial lines and health insurance premium growth in real-terms in 2023. Personal premiums written rose by 5.3% compared with 2022, driven by significant repricing of risk in motor and homeowner insurance. In contrast, commercial insurance premium growth was softer at about 2.5% in 2023, below its five-year average of 4.1%, as hard market conditions softened in advanced markets. Global reported price increases for composite commercial insurance were 2.0% in the fourth quarter of 2023, the slowest growth rate since early 2019. 2 However, worldwide commercial property insurance price growth remained strong at 6% in the fourth quarter - the 25th consecutive quarter of growth.\n\nGlobal health insurance premiums rose by around 3.7% in 2023. This followed a 0.7% increase in 2022, and comes just above the five-year average premium growth rate of 3.5%. The acceleration in growth is attributable to the US, where premiums grew by 3.6% in 2023 as insurers adjusted to higher costs and utilisation.\n\nIn advanced markets, non-life premiums written grew by around 3.6% in real terms\n\nin 2023, stronger than the 2018-2022 annual average of 2.9%. Advanced EMEA, North America and Advanced Asia performed similarly. Emerging market premiums rose by 4.2% in 2023, close to the five-year average growth. China, which accounts for about half of emerging market non-life premiums, grew more strongly than the rest, at around 5.0%. Emerging Europe and Middle East experienced no real growth in premiums, while real premiums declined in Latin America.\n\nInsurance claims in most large markets have increased markedly since 2021, in line with economic inflation. In 2023, the impact of economic inflation on claims growth eased from the heights of 2022, but it remains elevated. In the US, for example, non-life claims grew by 3.8% in 2023, following a 16.3% increase in 2022. Motor and property were the main contributors due to both higher frequency and severity. The shift of inflation into wages and healthcare costs in 2023 is seen in increasing claims costs in casualty lines, in particular from bodily injury claims.\n\nSwiss Re estimates overall profitability of the global non-life insurance industry, indicated by return on equity (ROE), at 5.9% in 2023. This is a clear improvement from 4.3% in 2022, which was the lowest point in recent years. In 2023, the further rise in claims was counterbalanced by more commensurate pricing, resulting in an industry combined ratio of 98.9%. Insurers' investment results also benefitted from higher yields on fixed income assets, which raised the total investment yield by about 1 percentage point vs 2022.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts global real growth in nonlife premiums of 3.1% in 2024. This would be around trend, as repricing continues, principally in personal lines, and despite slowing GDP growth globally. In 2025, premium growth is forecast at around 2.6%.\n\nUnderwriting profitability should improve further in 2024 as the impact of economic inflation on claims diminishes. As more of the fixed income portfolio is renewed at higher yields, investment returns are also expected to strengthen further. Industry return on equity (ROE) could consequently move up to 8.9% in 2024.",

Premiums from advanced markets increased in real terms while emerging market premiums grew by 5.2%.\n\nLow premium growth in advanced markets is primarily a consequence of substantial re-pricing of risk in non-life reinsurance at the January to July 2023 renewals. As a consequence of insufficient profitability the reinsurance industry did not earn its cost of capital between 2017 and 2022 - and tight reinsurance capacity, the renewals exhibited strong rate increases, tighter terms and conditions, and higher retentions by primary insurers, which lowered growth. Profitability conditions for the reinsurance sector have significantly improved. The rebalancing of risk-sharing between insurers and reinsurers has also enabled reinsurers to return to their role of absorbing shocks and smoothing earnings for insurers.\n\nNatural catastrophe losses in 2023 were again above average and Swiss Re estimates full-year losses for the insurance industry of more than USD 100 billion. A key characteristic of 2023 was the high frequency of low- to medium-severity loss events that aggregated to a high total loss number. The costliest event was the earthquake in Turkey and Syria in February 2023, which caused insured losses of USD 6.2 billion. By peril, losses were overwhelmingly driven by severe convective storms in the US, with aggregated insured losses of above USD 60 billion. Losses from tropical cyclones were below average. However, hurricane Otis, which hit the Pacific coast of Mexico, is likely to become the country's costliest insured event.\n\nSwiss Re estimates that the reinsurance sector (excluding health insurance) achieved return on equity (ROE) of around 15-20% in 2023. This was above the cost of capital for the industry. Preliminary data indicate a sector combined ratio of around 90-92% for 2023, a clear improvement from 98% in 2022 and 2021.\n\nBy the end of 2023, reinsurance capital (traditional and alternative) had recovered from a steep drop in 2022, as financial asset values fell. However, carriers continued to actively manage their limits in 2023, given both insufficient profitability in the past, and uncertainty over future claims such as the rising trend of natural catastrophe losses, inflation pressure on claims and social inflation. Although overall alternative capital inflows have been lacklustre since 2018, catastrophe bond issuance reached a new record high in 2023, a sign of growing demand for transfer of peak risks.\n\nThe sector's capital base remains very strong and enables reinsurers to continue to fulfil their role as the backbone of the insurance industry and supporters of societal resilience.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nThe January 2024 renewals were firm and underpin a positive outlook for the non-life reinsurance industry. Notable rate increases were limited to portfolios affected by higher claims developments. Such developments are likely to continue, where necessary, in relevant portfolios. The non-life reinsurance industry has a good chance to earn its cost of capital in 2024. Premium income growth is forecast to improve by 2.9% in real terms in 2024 and 2.3% in 2025, in parallel with growth in the primary non-life insurance market, with increased demand from the property line of business as the key driver.",

About 80% of life insurance premium income is derived from savings and retirement products and the rest from risk protection, which covers mortality, longevity and morbidity risks. Europe accounts for the largest share of saving business, at about 34%, followed by North America (28%). China (31%) is the largest market for life protection business globally, followed by North America (24%).\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global life insurance premiums grew by 1.8% in real terms in 2023 (3.2% in nominal terms), above the 2018-2022 annual average. Higher interest rates and rising wages in 2023 supported individual and group saving demand globally, but ongoing elevated inflation eroded nominal premium growth. Savings premiums growth was 2.1% in real terms while risk premiums grew by about 0.3%, below the five-year real trend of 1.9%.\n\nPremium income in advanced markets declined by 0.4% in real terms in 2023 (2.1% nominal growth). Advanced EMEA experienced a 1.1% contraction in premium growth, principally from Germany and Italy due to disposable income declines, lower new business volumes and higher lapses. This was partially offset by growth in the UK and France. Premium income grew by 1.3% in North America and declined by 1.7% in Advanced Asia in 2023. The higher interest rate environment was a new tailwind for annuity business and pension risk transfer deals, particularly in the US and the UK, which benefitted from higher crediting rates and funding ratios.\n\nEmerging markets excluding China grew by an estimated 3.1% in real terms in 2023, driven by India (4.1%), Eastern Europe (4.2%) and Mexico (10.5%). This was supported by a mix of factors, including regulatory changes, catch-up effects from\n\n2022 and demand for inflation-linked products. In China, the life insurance market grew by 12.5% in real terms and was boosted by strong sales of savings-type products, mainly via the bancassurance channel. China carried the total emerging market real growth of 8.9% in 2023.\n\nThe profitability of the global life insurance sector deteriorated slightly in the first half of 2023 from the end of 2022, as estimated by Swiss Re's profitability model. The key driver of this deterioration was the higher payments for surrenders and disability as well as accident and health benefits, as COVID-19 became endemic in the US. Higher interest rates continued to exceed running portfolio yields and investment returns improved as portfolios gradually rolled into higher yields in 2023.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts above-trend global growth of 1.6% in life insurance premiums in real terms in 2024, and 2.4% real growth in 2025. Higher interest rates in most advanced markets should continue to support above-trend demand for saving products, especially annuity products as individuals increasingly look to insurers for their retirement planning. Savings premiums are expected to grow in real terms by an above-trend 1.5% in 2024. Risk premiums should also grow by a below-trend 1.7% in 2024 in real terms.\n\nStructural factors including a growing global middle class and ageing demographics in advanced and emerging economies, will likely continue to underpin premium growth in both segments. Digital adoption along the life underwriting and claims cycle, public support for life insurance in emerging markets and the inadequacy of public pension provision in ageing societies worldwide are all expected to support demand for life insurance and reinsurance solutions over the long term.",

Advanced markets generated 86% of global ceded reinsurance premiums, and emerging markets 14%.\n\n## Market performance\n\nGlobal life reinsurance premiums decreased by 5.0% year-on-year in real terms in 2023. In nominal terms, growth was -1.8%. Growth in premium income was strongest in emerging markets at 5.0% in real terms in 2023. However, China, the largest life insurance market among emerging countries, shrank by 2.4% in 2023.\n\nIn advanced markets, the life reinsurance market contracted by 6.8% in real terms, with the strongest decline in the advanced Asia-Pacific region as a result of declining primary insurance premiums.\n\nGlobal life reinsurance profitability improved in 2023, supported by higher interest rates and much lower COVID-19 mortality claims. Swiss Re estimates that the life reinsurance industry operating margin approached its pre-pandemic level of 7.4% (2015-2019 average). Increasing investment returns were a tailwind for the life insurance industry overall, with reinvestment yields above portfolio running yields in 2023. Overall, life underwriting performance was positive in 2023. However, while the acute impacts of COVID-19 have faded, mortality has not reverted to pre-pandemic levels everywhere. The re/insurance industry is closely monitoring mortality and morbidity developments, and partially adjusted mortality pricing in 2023 to account for the longer-term implications of the pandemic. 4\n\n- 3 Health business is accounted for under the non-life insurance sections.\n- 4 AM Best's Market Segment Report, Global Reinsurance, September 2023.\n- 5 See Swiss Re, A retirement lifeline, October 2023.\n\nLongevity risk transfer is a growth area underpinning a very active pension risk transfer market in the US and the UK, with record-level transfers achieved in 2022 and 2023. Longevity reinsurance is central to the pricing of annuity transactions, as insurers offering the said transactions to pension funds typically look to simultaneously access reinsurance capacity to hedge at least part of the longevity risk inherent in these lines. 5 Life reinsurers are also increasingly involved in the development and reinsurance of capital-light, index-linked products with guaranteed benefits, notably in some European markets. Finally, the higher interest rate environment has increased the capital cost associated with the risk of lapses under Solvency II rules, which prompted pockets of growth for reinsurance solutions covering lapses in the last years.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts global life reinsurance premiums to increase in real terms by 1.4% and 2.2% in 2024 and in 2025, respectively, (4.1% and 4.9% in nominal terms). This is expected to be supported by a recovery in the primary life insurance market, as macroeconomic conditions normalise by the end of 2024. Emerging Asia is expected to continue to drive global growth as regulatory changes and government targets create new pockets of growth. North America and Advanced Europe are expected to grow slightly in 2024. Advanced Asia-Pacific should expand at an above-trend rate from 2024 onwards.",

We achieved all our financial targets in a year that was characterised by geopolitical turbulence and continued economic uncertainty.'\n\nChristian Mumenthaler Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Group results\n\nSwiss Re increased net income to USD 3.2 billion and delivered a 22% return on equity for 2023\n\nSwiss Re increased its full-year net income to USD 3.2 billion for 2023 from USD 472 million in 2022, with a return on equity (ROE) of 22.3%. The result was supported by improved underwriting margins while higher interest rates drove an increase in investment income.\n\nGroup net income was above the target of more than USD 3 billion for 2023.\n\nBased on Swiss Re's positive earnings momentum, the Board of Directors will propose an ordinary dividend of USD 6.80 per share, a 6% increase compared with the prior year.\n\nSwiss Re's Business Units also met their financial targets for the full year. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) achieved a combined ratio of 94.8%1 for 2023, meeting the target of\n\nless than 95%. Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) reported above-target net income of USD 976 million for 2023. Corporate Solutions' full-year combined ratio of 91.7%1 outperformed the target of less than 94%.\n\nThe property and casualty businesses benefitted from improved price adequacy following strong renewals. Disciplined underwriting allowed P&C Re and Corporate Solutions to manage elevated industry losses from natural catastrophes.\n\nP&C Re reported a net income of USD 1.9 billion for 2023, compared with USD 312 million in the previous year. The solid result was primarily driven by a resilient underwriting performance and disciplined renewals. Strong margins and positive reserve developments in property and speciality lines helped offset reserve\n\nstrengthening in the casualty business. In addition, the result was supported by a solid investment performance.\n\nLarge natural catastrophe claims amounted to USD 1.3 billion2 in 2023, below the full-year budget of USD 1.7 billion. These claims included the earthquake in Turkey and Syria at the beginning of the year, Hurricane Otis in Mexico in the fourth quarter as well as several storms and consequent flooding in Europe throughout the year.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) reported net income of USD 976 million for 2023, compared with USD 416 million in the previous year. The underlying result benefitted from active in-force portfolio management and a strong investment result, which offset elevated mortality claims in the US.",

        "page_content": "Corporate Solutions reported a net income of USD 678 million in 2023, compared with USD 486 million in the previous year. The increase reflects a steadily improved portfolio resilience, driven by disciplined underwriting and portfolio steering. Corporate Solutions' performance also benefitted from a higher investment result.\n\nHigher interest rates contributed positively to Swiss Re's investment result. The full-year return on investments (ROI) increased materially to 3.4% from 2.0% in 2022. This improvement was even more pronounced in the fourth quarter, when the recurring income yield rose to 3.9% and the reinvestment yield was 5.0%.\n\nSwiss Re's capital position continued to be strong. The Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio was 306% as of 1 January 2024, supported by solid earnings and the benefit of higher interest rates.\n\nShareholders' equity for the Group, excluding non-controlling interests, increased to USD 16.1 billion as of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 12.7 billion at the end of 2022. This reflected the net income of USD 3.2 billion, net change in unrealised losses on fixed income of USD 2.2 billion, partially offset by a payment to shareholders of USD 1.9 billion for the 2022 ordinary dividend.\n\nEarnings per share for 2023 were USD 11.09 or CHF 9.94, up from USD 1.63 or CHF 1.63 for 2022. Book value per share stood at USD 55.60 or CHF 46.79 at the end of 2023, compared with USD 43.94 or CHF 40.65 at the end of 2022. Book value per share is based on shareholders' equity and excludes non-controlling interests.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned and fee income for the Group rose 4.4% to USD 45.0 billion in 2023, compared with USD 43.1 billion in the previous year. At constant foreign exchange rates, net premiums earned and fee income increased by 4.9%. Gross premiums written increased by 4.3% to USD 50.0 billion in 2023.\n\nP&C Re's net premiums earned increased 3.9% to USD 22.9 billion in 2023 compared with the previous year. At constant foreign exchange rates, net premiums earned increased by 4.3%.\n\nL&H Re's net premiums earned and fee income increased 4.4% to USD 15.6 billion in 2023 compared with the previous year, driven by large transactions written across regions. At constant foreign exchange rates, net premiums earned and fee income increased by 5.6%.\n\nCorporate Solutions' net premiums earned remained stable at USD 5.5 billion in 2023 compared with the previous year. At constant foreign exchange rates and excluding the elipsLife business sold in mid-2022, net premiums earned increased by 7.3%, driven by new business mainly in property, credit & surety as well as in accident & health, partially offset by conscious reductions in professional liability lines.\n\n## Net premiums and fees earned Net premiums and fees earned by business segment, 2023\n\nby business segment, 2021 Total: USD 45.0 billion\n\n51%  P&C Reinsurance\n\n35%  L&H Reinsurance\n\n12%  Corporate Solutio\n\n<!-- image -->",

At constant foreign exchange rates, gross premiums written increased by 28.1%. The growth is mainly attributable to the EMEA regions. iptiQ achieved USD 60 million adjusted gross income 3 , an increase of 15.4% compared with USD 52 million in 2022.\n\niptiQ reported a loss before interest and tax (EBIT) of USD 247 million in 2023. This is in line with the full-year EBIT guidance of USD -250 million, compared with a loss of USD 362 million in 2022. iptiQ remains on track to achieve its 2025 break-even target.\n\nAlternative Capital Partners' activities generated USD 195 million in fee and commission revenues in 2023, compared with USD 116 million in 2022.

The increase was primarily driven by a higher contribution from private equity and foreign exchange gains, which were partially offset by realised losses from targeted sales of fixed income securities.",

This translates into an effective tax rate in the current and prior-year reporting periods of 27.3% and 26.3%, respectively. The tax rate in 2023 was driven by profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions, tax charges from non-deductible expenses, increases in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and tax charges from foreign currency translation differences between statutory and US GAAP accounts, partially offset by tax benefits from prior-year adjustments.\n\n- 1 The Group has prospectively, as from 1 January 2023, revised the methodology used to calculate the combined ratio to include interest on funds withheld.\n- 2 Net of reinstatement premiums of USD 67 million.\n- 3 Calculated as US GAAP EBIT adjusted for operating expenses, other overheads and investment gains/losses.\n- 4 P&C Re combined ratio definition: Insurance service expense (net) / Insurance revenue (net).\n- 5 Corporate Solutions combined ratio definition: (Insurance service expense (gross) + reinsurance result + non-attributable expenses) / Insurance revenue (gross).",

In this environment, P&C Re expects to grow in line with its risk appetite throughout 2024, prioritising capacity to long-term sustainable structures.\n\nThe casualty reinsurance portfolio continues to focus on profitability. P&C Re will continue to right-size underperforming\n\n- 1 Net of reinstatement premiums of USD 67 million.\n- 2 Net operating margin = Earnings before interest and income tax expenses (EBIT) / total revenues.\n- 3 The Group has prospectively, as from 1 January 2023, revised the methodology used to calculate the combined ratio to include interest on funds withheld.\n- 4 Operating expenses divided by premiums earned.\n- 5 P&C Re combined ratio definition: Insurance service expense (net) / Insurance revenue (net).\n\nportfolios, selectively grow diversifying pockets of business and apply high underwriting and costing discipline, while navigating a marketplace where demand and supply are in a fragile balance. P&C Re aims to defend the potential upside from the higher-yield environment, where conditions and rate improvements enable the business to keep up with loss trends.\n\nIn specialty lines, there is positive market momentum in selected lines, and P&C Re continues to capitalise on its leading franchise, with selected growth in engineering.

The underlying result benefitted from active in-force portfolio management and a strong investment result, which offset elevated mortality claims in the US.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned and fee income increased by 4.4% to USD 15.6 billion in 2023, compared with USD 15.0 billion in the previous year. At constant foreign exchange rates, the growth was 5.6%, supported by large transactions written across regions.\n\nGross premiums written in 2023 increased by USD 0.9 billion, or 5.8% to USD 16.9 billion. At stable foreign exchange rates, they would have increased by 7.1%.\n\n## Net operating margin1\n\nThe net operating margin was 8.6% in 2023, compared with a margin of 4.3% in the prior year. The increase was driven by a strong investment result and benefitted from active in-force portfolio management actions.\n\n## Management expense ratio2\n\nThe management expense ratio was 5.2%, compared with 5.1% in the prior year. The increase in operating revenues was more than offset by higher operating expenses.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nEarnings before interest and income tax expenses (EBIT) for the life business increased to USD 789 million in 2023 from USD 285 million in 2022. The result benefitted from a higher investment result, reflecting increased recurring income and higher realised gains, while the underwriting performance remained impacted by elevated mortality claims in the US.\n\nEBIT for the health business was USD 464 million in 2023, compared with USD 304 million in the prior year. The result benefitted from higher investment income due to increased reinvestment yields and realised gains, while the underwriting result reflected favourable impacts from active in-force portfolio management, partly offset by adverse experience across regions.",

The recurring income yield was 4.1% in 2023, compared with 3.2% in 2022, mainly reflecting reinvestments into a higher interest rate environment.\n\nNet investment-related realised gains were USD 285 million for 2023, compared with USD 105 million in 2022. The increase reflects an improved result from equities (net of derivatives) and lower credit-related losses as well as additional gains from internal loan restructurings, partially offset by fewer gains from sales.\n\nInsurance-related investment results as well as foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the figures above.\n\n## Outlook\n\nL&H Re has a positive outlook for 2024 based on high new business activity, the transition to IFRS and the benefit of higher interest rates on investment income.

The continued net income increase reflects a steadily improved portfolio resilience, driven by stringent portfolio steering and disciplined underwriting, supported by lower overall large losses and a higher investment result.\n\nThe net operating margin 2 was 15.5% for 2023, compared with 11.0% for 2022.\n\n## Premiums\n\nGross premiums written remained broadly unchanged at USD 8.2 billion in 2023, compared with the previous year, reflecting the partial sale of elipsLife business mid-2022. Business excluding the sold parts of elipsLife grew by 9.7% at constant foreign exchange rates, compared with 2022. This reflects strong new business growth, partly offset by a conscious reduction in professional liability lines.\n\nNet premiums earned remained stable at USD 5.5 billion in 2023 compared with the previous year, successfully offsetting the elipsLife business sale in mid-2022. At constant foreign exchange rates and excluding the impact of the elipsLife sale, the comparative increase was 7.3%. This was driven by new business mainly in property, credit and surety as well as accident and health, and the continuous earn-through of previously realised rate increases, absorbing a conscious reduction in professional liability lines.\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nCorporate Solutions' combined ratio was 91.7%1 for the full year, with a stable combined ratio delivery quarter-by-quarter, outperforming both the prior-year combined ratio of 93.1% and the target of less than 94% for 2023.\n\nThe enhanced performance demonstrates a steadily improved portfolio resilience, with total current-year large losses of USD 544 million, which were lower compared with the prior year. The\n\nBusiness Unit benefitted from overall low participation in large natural catastrophe events, while large man-made losses of USD 402 million were slightly higher than in the prior year, reflecting a series of losses in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nThe property combined ratio for 2023 improved to 70.7% from 72.9% in 2022. The line of business benefitted from strong new business growth along with rate increases earning through, and favourable prior-year development.\n\nThe casualty combined ratio increased to 109.8% in 2023, compared with 105.8% in 2022. This was mainly a result of prior-year man-made losses and assumption-driven reserve increases in professional liability.\n\nThe specialty combined ratio for 2023 improved to 94.4% from 96.2% in 2022, driven by enhanced profitability of the credit book and lower reserve additions related to the Ukraine war.",

Net investment income increased by USD 173 million to USD 401 million for 2023 due to a higher contribution from fixed income, reflecting higher reinvestment yields. Net realised losses were USD 8 million in 2023, compared with losses of USD 61 million in 2022, reflecting a favourable result from equities, partially offset by losses from targeted sales of fixed income securities.\n\nInsurance-related derivative results and foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the investment figures.\n\nCorporate Solutions offers insurance protection against weather perils and other risks, which is accounted for as derivatives. Insurance-related net realised gains were USD 42 million in 2023, compared with gains of USD 84 million in 2022, as the 2022 result benefitted from extraordinarily high margins.\n\n## Outlook\n\nCorporate Solutions will target a reported IFRS combined ratio4, defined in line with key primary insurance competitors, of less than 93% for the financial year 2024.\n\nCorporate Solutions observed moderate rate increases for the majority of 2023, slowing towards the end of the year.

Post-Covid distortions continued to unwind, with inflation normalising further from its peak as the rate-hike cycle continued in both the US and in Europe.\n\nThe magnitude of fiscal stimulus, the resilience of the labour markets and continued strong consumer spending in the US were the main positive surprises. There were also several challenging market events in 2023, such as the US regional banking crisis, whose impact proved to be limited and temporary, supported by a swift and decisive response from central banks to help contain the economic and financial fallout. Concerns about a cooling US economy were proven wrong by strong GDP growth in the third quarter, driving up expectations for a soft landing as the inflation rate continued to decline and\n\nnormalise. This was given a further boost in December by an earlier-than-expected dovish pivot by the Federal Reserve (Fed).\n\nIn terms of key market developments, the S&P 500 returned +24.2% in 2023, despite significant volatility during the year and limited breadth of the rally across sectors. The technology sector outperformed, thanks to rising optimism around artificial intelligence and rate-cut expectations.\n\nWith respect to interest rates, sovereign bond yields rose from May through October, before heading lower again in the fourth quarter and ending the year roughly unchanged. Volatility remained historically elevated, with some extreme moves on display. For example, on 13 March, the two-year US Treasury yield saw its largest daily decline since 1982, falling by 61 basis points (bps) to 3.98%, while in late October, prospects of higher-for-longer interest rates drove the 10-year US Treasury yield above 5% for the first time since 2007.\n\nFinally, spreads on investment grade corporate bonds widened to nearrecessionary levels during the March banking sector turmoil before tightening towards historical lows by year-end as risk sentiment improved. All this happened as the Fed and the European Central Bank (ECB) continued with the most aggressive interest rate hiking cycle in decades, delivering 100bps and 200bps of rate hikes, respectively, last year.\n\nSwiss Re's investment performance was strong, driven by the positive impact from reinvestments at higher yields. The result was further supported by net realised gains from real estate sales, which were partially offset by losses from the targeted sales of lower-yielding fixed income securities to further enhance the contribution from recurring income. The portfolio continues to benefit from an up-in-quality bias and a further increase in the allocation to private markets.",

        "page_content": "## Investment result\n\nThe investment result was driven by recurring income and a positive contribution from alternative investments. The Group's non-participating investment portfolio increased to USD 111.3 billion at the end of 2023 from USD 105.7 billion at the end of 2022, primarily reflecting the impact of a weaker US dollar. The return on investments (ROI) was 3.4% for 2023, compared with 2.0% for 2022.\n\nThe Group manages its investment portfolio with a continued focus on maximising recurring income. The Group's nonparticipating net investment income was USD 4.0 billion in 2023, compared with USD 2.9 billion in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by higher recurring income. The Group's recurring income yield was 3.6% in 2023, compared with 2.6% in 2022, reflecting reinvestment into higheryielding fixed income securities.\n\nThe Group reported non-participating net realised gains of USD 719 million in 2023, compared with losses of USD 3 million in 2022. The increase was primarily driven by a higher contribution from private equity and foreign exchange gains, which were partially offset by realised losses from targeted sales of fixed income securities.\n\n## Outlook\n\nGlobal economic growth is expected to slow in 2024, as the effect of cumulative interest rate hikes continue to feed through to the real economy. Inflation, while moderating, is projected to remain above central bank targets.\n\nSwiss Re believes that sovereign bond yields will settle in a higher range compared with the last decade, while material upside in risk assets will become more difficult to attain, also given stretched valuations. As such, focus on quality and selectivity of deployment across sectors and geographies are key.\n\nSwiss Re's investment portfolio remains well-diversified, both across asset classes and regions. The Group aims to maintain the allocation to higher-quality credit products and to selectively regrow the listed equity portfolio subject to market developments. Private markets continue to be an important pillar of the portfolio strategy and positioning, where Swiss Re intends to further grow the exposure in private debt given continued attractive investment opportunities.\n\nSwiss Re continues to work towards reaching its target of Group-wide net-zero emissions by 2050 and has set intermediate carbon intensity reduction targets for both the corporate bond and listed equity portfolio as well as parts of the real estate portfolio.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nNet investment income in USD billions, 2023 (2022: USD 2.9 billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup return on investments 2023 (2022: 2.0%)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nGroup recurring income yield 2023 (2022: 2.6%)",

Dacey Group Chief Financial Officer\n\nWith the adoption of IFRS as the new accounting basis as of 2024, Swiss Re will discontinue EVM reporting.\n\n## EVM performance\n\nThe economic results in Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re), Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) and Corporate Solutions reflected strong new business and good investment performance, partially offset by a loss from previous years' business.\n\nSwiss Re reported a total contribution to economic net worth (ENW) of USD 3.2 billion in 2023, compared with USD -1.6 billion in 2022. On a risk-adjusted basis, Swiss Re reported an EVM profit of USD 1.2 billion in 2023, compared with an EVM loss of USD 4.1 billion in 2022.\n\n## Group performance\n\nThe EVM profit of USD 1.2 billion in 2023 reflected strong new business performance from P&C Re, L&H Re and Corporate Solutions as well as a good investment\n\nresult. This was partially offset by a loss from previous years' business, driven primarily by L&H Re due to assumption updates and adverse experience.\n\nThe EVM profit on new business increased to USD 3.7 billion in 2023 from USD 1.4 billion in 2022. The strong 2023 result was driven by a favourable pricing environment in P&C Re, transactional business in L&H Re and robust underwriting in Corporate Solutions.\n\n## Key information\n\n| USD millions, unless otherwise stated       | 2022   | 2023   | Change in %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| EVM profit                                  | -4 126 | 1 228  | n/a           |\n| Total contribution to ENW                   | -1 579 | 3 217  | n/a           |\n| Economic net worth (ENW)                    | 31 107 | 32 785 | 5             |\n| Economic net worth per share in USD         | 107.64 | 112.89 | 5             |\n| Economic net worth per share growth, % 1    | -5.9   | 10.8   |               |\n| Profit margin - new business, %             | 4.9    | 12.4   |               |\n| Profit margin - previous years' business, % | -15.6  | -11.3  |               |\n| Profit margin - investments, %              | -11.6  | 7.4    |               |\n\nThe EVM loss from previous years' business amounted to USD 3.2 billion in 2023, compared with an EVM loss from previous years' business of USD 4.7 billion in 2022.

The 2023 result was driven by outperformance in credit products.

The EVM profit on new business of USD 2.0 billion in 2023 was driven by strong renewals outcome and lower-than-expected large loss experience. EVM loss on previous years' business amounted to USD 565 million in 2023, driven by reserve strengthening in US casualty, and natural catastrophe losses such as earthquake in Turkey and Syria, Cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in New Zealand, partially offset by reserve releases in property and specialty. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 108 million in 2023, compared with a profit of USD 852 million in 2022. The 2023 result reflected the outperformance in credit, partially offset by a negative impact from interest rate movements on a net short duration position. In comparison, the 2022 result reflected the favourable impact of higher interest rates on a net short duration position and outperformance from alternative investments, partially offset by credit spread widening and equities underperformance.\n\nvariances in property and specialty. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 24 million, compared to an EVM loss of USD 1 million in 2022. The positive result was driven by credit outperformance, reflecting tighter investment grade credit spreads.

The significantly lower EVM loss on new business of USD 26 million in 2023, compared with a loss of USD 160 million in 2022, was mainly due to higher trademark licence fee income from the business segments and a lower loss from iptiQ. The EVM loss on previous years' business of USD 268 million mainly related to adverse assumption updates and experience variances in iptiQ, unfavourable run-off business and increased Group overhead expenses. Investment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 68 million in 2023, compared with a loss of USD 222 million in 2022. The 2023 result reflected valuation losses in Principal Investments, partially offset by a favourable impact from interest rate movements.\n\nL&H Re reported an EVM loss of USD 537 million in 2023 compared with a loss of USD 3.3 billion in 2022. The EVM profit on new business of USD 1.4 billion in 2023 benefitted from transactional business. The EVM loss on previous years' business of USD 2.5 billion mainly reflected unfavourable assumption changes, and elevated mortality experience in the US. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 573 million in 2023, compared with a loss of USD 1.5 billion in 2022. The 2023 profit was driven by a positive impact from interest rate movements and credit spread tightening. In comparison, the 2022 loss was driven by the adverse impact of higher interest rates on a net long duration position as well as credit spread widening.\n\nCorporate Solutions reported an EVM profit of USD 576 million in 2023, compared with a profit of USD 402 million in 2022. The EVM profit on new business of USD 359 million in 2023 reflected a robust underwriting result due to a steadily improved portfolio resilience driven by stringent portfolio steering and disciplined underwriting, supported by lower overall large losses. The EVM profit on previous years' business of USD 193 million benefitted from favourable experience\n\n## Business segments - key information\n\n| USD millions, unless otherwise stated       | Proper t y & C a s u a l t y  Reinsurance   | L i f e  & H e a l t h  Reinsurance   | Corporate  Solutions   | Group  items   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------|\n| 2022                                        |                                             |                                       |                        |                |         |\n| EVM profit                                  | -738                                        | -3 284                                | 402                    | -506           | -4 126  |\n| Total contribution to ENW                   | 447                                         | -2 063                                | 629                    | -593           | -1 579  |\n| Profit margin - new business, %             | 2.7                                         | 9.3                                   | 5.4                    | n/a            | 4.9     |\n| Profit margin - previous years' business, % | -14.1                                       | -20.8                                 | 9.6                    | n/a            | -15.6   |\n| Profit margin - investments, %              | 21.5                                        | -58.9                                 | -0.2                   | -32.0          | -11.6   |\n\n| USD millions, unless otherwise stated       | Proper t y & C a s u a l t y  Reinsurance   | L i f e  & H e a l t h  Reinsurance   | Corporate  Solutions   | Group  items   | Total   |\n|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------|---------|\n| 2023                                        |                                             |                                       |                        |                |         |\n| EVM profit                                  | 1 552                                       | -537                                  | 576                    | -362           | 1 228   |\n| Total contribution to ENW                   | 2 626                                       | 371                                   | 957                    | -737           | 3 217   |\n| Profit margin - new business, %             | 15.1                                        | 10.7                                  | 10.9                   | n/a            | 12.4    |\n| Profit margin - previous years' business, % | -4.5                                        | -19.4                                 | 8.6                    | n/a            | -11.3   |\n| Profit margin - investments, %              | 2.2                                         | 20.5                                  | 5.0                    | -14.5          | 7.4     |",

In addition, the EVM balance sheet provides the basis for determining available capital under the Swiss Solvency Test (SST).\n\nThe EVM framework differs significantly from US GAAP, which is the basis on which Swiss Re prepares its consolidated financial statements. Swiss Re's EVM income statement (and its line items) should not be viewed as a substitute for the income statement (and its line items) in Swiss Re's US GAAP consolidated financial statements, and Swiss Re's EVM economic net worth (ENW) should not be viewed as\n\na substitute for shareholders' equity as reported in Swiss Re's US GAAP consolidated balance sheet. EVM results may be subject to significant volatility as assets and liabilities are measured on a market-consistent basis.\n\nThe EVM financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's EVM principles and follows largely the same consolidation principles as used in the preparation of the Group's consolidated US GAAP financial statements.\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the reporting currency at closing exchange rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the\n\nreporting currency at average exchange rates for the reporting year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recognised directly in ENW with no impact on the EVM income statement.\n\nEVM follows a closed-book principle and excludes the recognition of all potential future new business activities, including future renewals.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMeasuring economic performance & solvency at Swiss Re https://www.swissre.com/Library/ measuring-economic-performance-\n\nsolvency-at-swiss-re.html",

Rating agencies AM Best, Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) rated Swiss Re's financial strength 'superior', 'excellent' and 'very strong', respectively. This capital strength enables Swiss Re to support its clients while continuing to offer an attractive dividend to shareholders.\n\nSwiss Re's overarching target is to maintain a very strong capital position that operates efficiently within constraints imposed by regulators and requirements from rating agencies, while giving the company maximum financial flexibility. Swiss Re's capital allocation decisions are steered to make capital and liquidity fungible to the Group wherever possible, while complying with local regulations and client needs.\n\nBased on the Group's capital strength and solid earnings in 2023, the Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend of USD 6.80 per share for the 2023 financial year, reflecting an increase of 6% from last year's dividend. Although declared in USD, shareholders will receive the 2024 dividend payment in CHF converted from USD.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity\n\nSwiss Re's core insurance and reinsurance operations generate liquidity primarily through premium income. Exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events, and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the Group.\n\nThe amount of liquidity held is largely determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events. Based on these internal liquidity stress tests, it is estimated that Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, the most important legal entity of the Group from a liquidity perspective, currently holds significant surplus liquidity.\n\nSwiss Re also provides FINMA, its principal regulator, with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA Circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers'.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nGroup Risk Management is key to the controlled risk-taking that underpins Swiss Re's financial strength. Risk Management is mandated to ensure that the Group and its legal entities have the necessary expertise, frameworks and infrastructure to support sound risk-taking. In addition, it monitors and ensures adherence to applicable frameworks and also performs reserving and reporting activities.\n\nRisk Management is embedded throughout Swiss Re's business. The Group has dedicated Chief Risk Officers (CRO) and risk teams for all major legal entities and regions. These are closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, but remain part of the Risk Management function under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks. They are supported in this by central risk teams that provide specialised risk expertise and oversight.\n\nThe Group's risk-taking is steered by Swiss Re's Risk Appetite Framework, which consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance. The risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk-return view. The risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nSwiss Re's proprietary integrated risk model provides a meaningful assessment of the risks to which the Group is exposed and represents an important tool for managing its business. It determines the capital requirements for internal purposes and forms the basis for regulatory reporting under the SST and under Solvency II for legal entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom.\n\nSwiss Re continuously reviews and updates its risk model and parameters to reflect the Group's experience, as well as changes in the risk environment and current best practice.\n\n## Swiss Re's risk profile\n\nIn SST 2024, Swiss Re's total risk increased to USD 20.2 billion, mainly driven by higher financial market risk. The shift led to an increase in diversification at risk category level.\n\nThe slight increase in property and casualty risk is mainly driven by higher reserve volatilities impacting the costing & reserving risk, partially offset by a reduction in natural catastrophe and cyber risks.\n\nHigher life and health risk mainly reflects business growth in the US, resulting in higher exposure to mortality trend and lethal pandemic risk. The increase is further driven by the impact on exposure of reviewability parameter updates and lower interest rates.\n\nFinancial market risk increased significantly, mainly due to corporate bond purchases and the reduction in investment hedges.\n\nThe significant increase in credit risk is driven by new business in credit and surety, the unwinding of investment hedges and corporate bond purchases.",

Accordingly, the information presented on the following pages is based on currently available information and may differ from the final Group SST 2024 figures.\n\nSwiss Re maintains a strong capital position, with the Group SST 2024 ratio increasing by 12pp to 306% compared with SST 2023.

        "page_content": "The overall contribution from underwriting activities was positive, mainly reflecting favourable underwriting results from Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions. This was partially offset by negative underwriting performance from Life & Health Reinsurance and Group items:\n\n- \u00b7 The Property & Casualty Reinsurance positive underwriting contribution was mainly driven by strong renewals outcome and reserve releases in property and specialty. This was partially offset by reserve strengthening in US casualty, and natural catastrophe losses such as the earthquake in Turkey and Syria, cyclone Gabrielle and flooding in New Zealand.\n- \u00b7 The Life & Health Reinsurance negative underwriting contribution was mainly driven by unfavourable assumption changes, and elevated mortality experience in the US. This was partially offset by transactional business.\n- \u00b7 The Corporate Solutions positive underwriting contribution mainly reflected a robust underwriting result due to a steadily improved portfolio resilience driven by stringent portfolio steering and disciplined underwriting, supported by lower overall large losses and favourable experience variances in property and specialty.\n- \u00b7 The Group items negative underwriting contribution was mainly related to adverse assumption updates and experience variances in iptiQ as well as unfavourable run-off business and increased Group overhead expenses.\n\nThe positive investment contribution was mainly driven by outperformance in credit products and favourable interest rates impact.\n\nForeign exchange impacts were positive, mostly driven by the depreciation of the US dollar against major currencies.\n\nDeductions mainly reflect projected dividends (to be paid in 2024, subject to AGM 2024 approval) as well as deferred and transactional real estate-specific taxes.\n\nThe decrease in supplementary capital was mainly driven by the buyback of subordinated debt instruments that are eligible supplementary capital under SST, partially offset by the issuance of a new supplementary capital instrument and market value movements.\n\nThe market value margin is added as a liability in accordance with Art. 30 para. 2 ISO. Market value margin remained stable, as the impact of lower interest rates in most major currencies was offset by parameter updates in mortality trend and critical illness.\n\n## SST target capital (SST TC)\n\nSwiss Re uses an internal risk model to determine the economic capital required to support the risks on the Group's book, as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity to the different lines of business. The model also provides the basis for capital cost allocation, which is used for pricing, profitability evaluation and compensation decisions. In addition to these internal purposes, the model is used to determine regulatory capital requirements under economic solvency frameworks such as SST and Solvency II.\n\nIn 2017, FINMA approved Swiss Re's internal model and its components for SST reporting purposes under their revised model review process.\n\nSince SST 2023, the following major model change has been implemented and approved by FINMA for SST 2024.\n\n- \u00b7 Risk exposures for financial market risk and for default-related effects that were previously based on Swiss Re's internal Economic Value Management view have now been linked to SST quantities. This change does not have a significant impact on the solvency ratio.\n\nThe risk exposure basis for SST is a projection for the period from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2024, and is based on the economic balance sheet as of 31 December 2023 and adjustments to reflect 1 January 2024 business shifts.\n\nTo derive SST target capital, total risk is adjusted for the line item 'Other impacts' as shown below. 'Other impacts' mainly reflect the impact from business development in the forecasting period.\n\nSST target capital increased to USD 14.3 billion, driven by the increase in total risk (see Risk assessment, page 59 for details), partially offset by higher short-term interest rates.\n\n## SST Target Capital\n\n| USD millions       | SST 2023 based on new ISO   | SST 2024   | Change   |\n|--------------------|-----------------------------|------------|----------|\n| Total risk         | 18 974                      | 20 210     | 1 2 3 6  |\n| Other impacts      | -5 049                      | -5 955     | -906     |\n| SST target capital | 13 925                      | 14 255     | 330      |",

The insurance financial strength ratings are shown in the table below.\n\nOn 1 November 2023, S&P published a credit opinion with a AA- financial strength of Swiss Re and its core subsidiaries. The outlook on the rating is 'stable'. The rating reflects Swiss Re's leading position in the non-life and life reinsurance market with a renowned brand, diversified product suite and very strong capital adequacy.\n\nOn 18 December 2023, Moody's re-affirmed the Aa3 insurance financial strength rating of Swiss Re and its core subsidiaries with a stable outlook. The rating reflects Swiss Re's excellent market\n\nposition, high degree of geographic and business diversification, very strong capital adequacy, conservative investment portfolio and very good financial flexibility.\n\nOn 6 September 2023, AM Best confirmed the Swiss Re Group financial strength rating of A+ (Superior) with stable outlook.

The Group's exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the organisation.\n\nA range of liquidity policies and measures are in place to manage these risks, in particular to ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7 sufficient liquidity is held to meet funding requirements under current conditions as well as adverse circumstances;\n- \u00b7 diversified sources are used to meet the Group's residual funding needs;\n- \u00b7 long-term liquidity needs are taken into account in the Group's planning process and in asset-liability management.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nSwiss Re's core liquidity policy is to retain access to sufficient liquidity in the form of unencumbered liquid assets, cash and pre-funded facilities to meet potential funding requirements arising from a range of possible stress events. To allow for regulatory restrictions on intra-Group funding, liquidity is managed from a legal entity perspective. The amount of liquidity held is determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events.\n\nThe funding requirements under stress include:\n\n- \u00b7 cash and collateral outflows, as well as potential capital and funding support required by subsidiaries as a result of loss events;\n- \u00b7 repayment or loss of all maturing unsecured debt and credit facilities;\n- \u00b7 additional collateral requirements associated with a potential ratings downgrade of Swiss Re;\n- \u00b7 further contingent funding requirements related to asset downgrades;\n- \u00b7 other large committed payments, such as expenses, commissions and tax.\n\nThe stress tests also assume that funding from assets is subject to conservative asset liquidation assumptions, intra-Group funding is not available if subject to regulatory approval, no new unsecured funding is available and funding from new re/insurance business is reduced.\n\nThe primary liquidity stress test is based on a one-year time horizon and a loss event corresponding to 99% tail value at risk (see page 59).\n\nSwiss Re's liquidity stress tests are reviewed regularly and their main assumptions are approved by the Group Executive Committee. Swiss Re provides FINMA with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA Circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers'.\n\n## Liquidity position of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (SRZ)\n\nFrom a liquidity perspective, SRZ is the most important legal entity of the Group. The estimated total liquidity sources in SRZ assumed to be available within one year in stressed conditions, net of short-term loans from Swiss Re Ltd and securities lending, amounted to USD 28.2 billion as of 31 December 2023, compared with USD 25.0 billion as of 31 December 2022.\n\nBased on the internal liquidity stress tests described above, Swiss Re estimates that SRZ holds surplus liquidity after dividends payable to Swiss Re Ltd. In 2023, the amount of surplus liquidity increased. This was largely driven by sizeable operating cash flows, partly offset by the buying back of subordinated debt in October.",

Individuals are accountable for the risks they take on, and their incentives are aligned with Swiss Re's overall business objectives.\n- \u00b7 Independent risk controlling - Dedicated units within Risk Management control all risk-taking activities. These are supported by Compliance and Group Internal Audit functions.\n- \u00b7 Open risk culture - Risk transparency, knowledge sharing and responsiveness to change are integral to the risk control process. The central goal of risk transparency is to create a culture of mutual trust and reduce the likelihood of surprises in the source and potential magnitude of losses.\n- \u00b7 The lowest level comprises risk management methodology and process documentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Three lines of control\n\nIn line with the principle of independent risk controlling, Swiss Re organises risk controlling along three lines, with progressive levels of independence. This approach is designed to achieve a strong, coherent and Group-wide risk culture built on the principles of ownership and accountability.\n\n- \u00b7 The first line comprises the day-to-day risk control activities performed by risk takers in the business as well as in corporate functions, including proactive identification of risks, as well as establishing and operating an effective control system.\n- \u00b7 Independent oversight performed by the Risk Management and Compliance functions represents the second line of control.\n- \u00b7 The third line consists of independent audits of processes and procedures carried out by Group Internal Audit or by external auditors.",

Its principal components are summarised in a framework that builds on the Group's Code of Conduct as well as on the risk management principles set forth in the Group Risk Policy.\n\nThe risk culture framework serves to promote rigour and discipline, and influence appropriate risk-taking behaviour: risk takers are expected to exhibit in four key aspects, which are assessed annually for all employees in the performance and compensation process:\n\n- \u00b7 Leadership in providing clear vision and direction\n- \u00b7 Consideration of risk in decision-making and incentives\n- \u00b7 Clearly defined roles and responsibilities around risk control and transparent flow of risk information\n- \u00b7 Risk management skills and knowledge\n\nSwiss Re's risk culture provides the foundation for the efficient and effective application of its Group-wide risk management framework. Group Risk Management reinforces the risk culture by ensuring risk transparency and fostering open discussion and challenge in the Group's risk-taking and risk management processes.\n\nKey risk takers across Swiss Re are a particular focus in promoting good risk and control-related behaviours. The relevant positions are identified in a regular process, and those who hold them are subject to additional behavioural objectives and assessments.\n\nTraining of risk management professionals is an integral element of Swiss Re's risk management strategy. Risk training needs are identified for each employee and all new staff complete special induction training as well as mandatory training courses on risk awareness.",

It approves the Group's risk strategy and Group Risk Policy, which defines Swiss Re's risk appetite and tolerance, key principles for risk-taking and control, and key capital structuring principles based on endorsement by the Risk Committee. The Group Board mainly performs risk oversight and governance through its Risk Committee and its Audit Committee:\n\n- \u00b7 The Risk Committee - Assists the Board in ensuring the Group's risk management and control framework, risk appetite and risk-taking principles are adequate, aligned with the business strategy and properly applied. In this role, it reviews risk aspects related to underwriting activities, new products and strategic initiatives, and is responsible for overseeing the Group's capital allocation and funding activities.\n\nThe Risk Committee's responsibilities include reviewing the Group Risk Policy and endorsing it for approval to the Group Board of Directors, as well as reviewing risk limits established to control risk tolerance, monitoring their usage and deciding on actions following any breaches. In addition, the Risk Committee reviews and discusses with the Group Chief Risk Officer the most important risk exposures, critical principles used in internal risk measurement, the valuation risk of assets and liabilities, and the capital and liquidity adequacy assessment.\n\n- \u00b7 The Audit Committee - Assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of the Group's and the company's financial statements and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

        "page_content": "The Group CRO leads the independent Risk Management function, which is responsible for risk oversight and control across Swiss Re. Risk Management provides assurance to executive management and boards of directors at all levels of Swiss Re that risk-taking is well controlled, in line with risk appetite, and complies with all internal and external regulations. The Risk Management function thus forms an integral part of Swiss Re's business model and risk management framework.\n\nSwiss Re's Risk Management function comprises global departments that provide specialised risk expertise and oversight, as well as business-level risk departments for P&C Reinsurance, L&H Reinsurance, Corporate Solutions and Global Clients & Solutions. In addition, the Risk Management function also includes the specialised risk, insurance and economic expertise and research of the Swiss Re Institute.\n\nThe global risk management departments oversee Group liquidity and capital adequacy and maintain the Group frameworks for controlling these risks throughout Swiss Re. They also support CROs at Group and legal entity level in discharging their oversight responsibilities. They do so by providing services, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk management\n- \u00b7 Specialised risk category expertise and accumulation control\n- \u00b7 Risk modelling and analytics\n- \u00b7 Regulatory relations management\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the central risk governance framework\n\nThe business-level Risk Management departments provide the expertise and resources for the control of insurance and operational risks within their respective business scope, and are also in charge of actuarial reserving and monitoring reserve holdings in their business areas. The heads of these departments have a dual role, as they also serve as CROs of their respective Business Units. P&C and L&H Reinsurance Risk Management also perform Group-level accumulation control for P&C and L&H risks, respectively, in addition to their Business Unit-specific responsibilities.\n\nThe business-level Risk Management departments are supported by functional and regional CROs, as well as by legal entity\n\nrisk teams led by dedicated CROs who report directly or indirectly to their top-level entity CRO, with a secondary reporting line to their legal entity CEO. These legal entity CROs are responsible for risk oversight in their entities, as well as for establishing the proper risk governance to ensure efficient risk identification, assessment and control. They are assisted by subsidiary CROs who are responsible for overseeing risk management issues that arise at regional or subsidiary level.\n\nWhile the Risk Management organisation is closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, all embedded teams and CROs remain part of the Group Risk Management function under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks.\n\nRisk management activities are complemented by Swiss Re's Group Internal Audit and Compliance units:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Internal Audit performs independent, objective assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control systems. It evaluates the execution of processes within Swiss Re, including those within Risk Management.\n- \u00b7 The Compliance function oversees Swiss Re's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules - primarily in relation to compliance risks - and the Code of Conduct. It also assists the Group Board of Directors, the Group Executive Committee and other management bodies in identifying, mitigating and managing compliance risks.\n\n## Risk control framework\n\nSwiss Re operates within a clearly defined risk control framework. This is set out in the Group Risk Management Standards and comprises a body of standards that establishes an internal control system for taking and managing risk. These standards set responsibilities for risk takers and risk controllers. The risk control framework defines key tasks, which are the core components of Swiss Re's risk management cycle:\n\n- \u00b7 Limit setting and monitoring - Allows Swiss Re to control its risk-taking decisions and total risk accumulations, including the passive risk the company is exposed to through its operations.\n- \u00b7 Risk oversight of plan - Ensures that the risk implications of plans are understood and determines whether business and investment plans adhere to the internal risk appetite framework, including risk appetite and tolerance.\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and exposure quantification - Ensures that all risks to which Swiss Re is exposed are transparent in order to make them controllable and manageable.\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment - Enables Swiss Re to understand the magnitude and nature of its risks through quantitative and qualitative analysis, ensuring that the company operates within its risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk reporting - Creates internal risk transparency and enables Swiss Re to meet external disclosure requirements.\n\nSwiss Re has implemented a principlebased integrated internal control system to mitigate identified operational risks including financial reporting and compliance risks, as well as risks that could impair the effectiveness and efficiency of operations. This control system represents a subset of Swiss Re's risk control framework and is based on international standards established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is applied on multiple organisational levels, including Group, functions, regions and legal entities.\n\n## Risk transfer\n\nTo efficiently manage capital across the Group and ensure that risk-taking in individual legal entities is well diversified, the Group employs internal retrocession and funding agreements. These serve to improve the fungibility of capital and consequently, Group-wide diversification. In addition, the Group aims to maximise the amount of funds available centrally by optimising the excess capital held within its subsidiaries and branches.\n\nSwiss Re also manages and mitigates insurance risk through external retrocession, insurance risk swaps or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities, industry loss warranties or other derivatives. This provides protection against extreme catastrophic events, further diversifies risk, stabilises economic results and releases underwriting capacity.",

        "page_content": "## Risk Appetite Framework\n\nThe Risk Appetite Framework establishes the overall approach through which Swiss Re practices controlled risk-taking throughout the Group. The framework is set out in the Group Risk Policy and consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn addition, Swiss Re uses financial market derivative instruments as well as financial market securities to hedge financial market and credit risks arising from investments and insurance liabilities. Interest rate risk from insurance liabilities is managed through investments in fixed income instruments whose pricing is sensitive to changes in government yields, such as government bonds.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nIn the context of business strategy and planning, the risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk-return view, while the risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nDuring strategic planning and target setting, Risk Management provides an opinion on the proposed strategy and targets to the Group Executive Committee, and ultimately the Group Board of Directors. The opinion focusses on the risk impact of the proposed strategy and the risks related to its implementation. The strategic plan, risk appetite and capital allocation ambition are expressed in a target portfolio for the Group's assets and liabilities, which should ultimately deliver the Group's targeted performance.\n\nown principles on acceptable risks and provides key directions for risk-taking and risk controlling as part of implementing Swiss Re's strategy: achieving targeted performance, providing liquidity and financial flexibility, managing capital adequacy, and protecting and growing franchise value.\n\nThe Group Board of Directors further details Swiss Re's risk appetite through its approval of Swiss Re Group's underwriting plan and asset management SAA, as well as the Group's capital and financial plan.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance describes the extent to which the Group and SRZ Boards of Directors have authorised executive management to assume risk. It represents the amount of risk that Swiss Re is willing to accept within the constraints imposed by its capital and liquidity resources, its strategy, and the regulatory and rating agency environment within which it operates.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance is based on the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To maintain Group capital at a level that safeguards respectability with clients and regulators.\n\nSwiss Re's risk appetite outlines the Group's\n\n- \u00b7 To ensure the resilience of SRZ as the main operating entity from a capital and liquidity perspective.\n- \u00b7 To avoid material operational risks that could subject the Group to large operational losses with corresponding consequences from an economic, reputational or regulatory perspective.\n\nTo meet the first objective, the Risk Policy defines internal respectability limits to ensure that the Group has enough resources to meet capital requirements at Group level, as well as respectability and liquidity requirements for all legal entities. These limits ensure that Swiss Re has adequate capital and liquidity above minimum requirements to be considered a respectable counterparty by external stakeholders. To meet the second objective, Swiss Re's risk tolerance criteria include internal resilience limits for SRZ to ensure that the main operating entity is able to withstand capital and liquidity stresses. To meet the third objective, the Group has established a Group-wide risk matrix methodology in which key operational risks are assessed against an acceptable level of expected losses. Any operational risk exposure that exceeds the Group's internal operational risk tolerance is subject to a mitigation plan that is monitored by the Group Risk Committee.\n\nInternal risk tolerance respectability criteria for the Swiss Re Group are set out in the Group Risk Policy. The Group and SRZ Boards are responsible for approving the risk tolerance criteria, as well as for monitoring and reviewing risk tolerance. Breaches or anticipated breaches of limits established to control the risk tolerance criteria must be communicated to the Risk Committee.\n\nSwiss Re's risk-taking is governed by a limit framework in order to ensure that accumulation risk and large losses remain at an acceptable level, as well as to steer the allocation of available risk capacity. The limit framework is rooted in the risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives set in the Group Risk Policy, and helps to translate these objectives into concrete, measurable criteria. In addition, lower-level limits are implemented to allocate scarce capacity. The limit framework also allows for risk monitoring and thus supports risk controlling during the execution of the plan.",

Key drivers of financial market risk are credit spread and equity risk. Credit risk is mainly driven by the credit and surety business, and by default risk on capital market products.\n\nTotal risk is based on 99% tail value-atrisk (tail VaR) and represents the average unexpected loss that occurs with a frequency of less than once in 100 years over a one-year time horizon.\n\nTotal risk increased to USD 20.2 billion, mainly driven by higher financial market risk.

These include operational, liquidity, model, valuation, regulatory, political, strategic and sustainability risks.\n\nProperty and casualty risk is mainly driven by underlying risks inherent in the business Swiss Re underwrites, in particular non-life claims inflation, natural catastrophe, man-made, and costing and reserving risk.

These include risks that are actively taken as part of insurance or asset management operations, and are calculated in the internal risk model as part of the Group's economic capital requirement as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity:\n\n- \u00b7 Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance risk  arises from coverage provided for property, liability, motor and accident risks, as well as for specialty risks such as engineering, agriculture, aviation, marine and cyber. It includes underlying risks inherent in the business Swiss Re underwrites, such as inflation or uncertainty in pricing and reserving.\n\n- \u00b7 Life and Health (L&H) insurance risk arises from coverage provided for mortality (death), longevity (annuity) and morbidity (illness and disability). In addition to potential shock events (such as a severe pandemic), it includes underlying risks inherent in life and health contracts that arise when mortality, morbidity or lapse experience deviates from expectations.\n- \u00b7 Financial market (FM) risk  represents the potential impact on assets or liabilities that may arise from movements in financial market prices or rates, such as equity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, hedge fund prices, real estate prices, commodity prices or foreign exchange rates. Financial market risk originates from two main sources: investment activities and the sensitivity of the economic value of liabilities to financial market fluctuations.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk  reflects the potential financial loss that may arise due to diminished creditworthiness or default of counterparties of Swiss Re or of third parties. Credit risk arises from investment and treasury activities, structured transactions and retrocession, as well as from liabilities underwritten by credit and surety insurance units.\n\n## Credit\n\n- \u00b7 Default risk\n- \u00b7 Migration risk\n\n<!-- image -->",

Swiss Re has implemented a capital model for operational risk, which is used for Solvency II purposes.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk  represents the possibility that Swiss Re will not be able to meet expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without affecting either daily operations or Swiss Re's financial condition.\n- \u00b7 Model risk  reflects the potential impact of model errors or the inappropriate use of model outputs. It may arise from data errors or limitations, operational or simulation errors, or limitations in model specification, calibration or implementation. Model risk may also be caused by insufficient knowledge of the model and its limitations, in particular by management and other decision makers.\n- \u00b7 Valuation risk  represents uncertainty around the appropriate value of assets or liabilities. It may arise from product complexity, parameter uncertainty, quality and consistency of data, valuation methodology or changes in market conditions and liquidity. Swiss Re is exposed to financial valuation risk from investment assets it holds as well as reserve valuation risk from insurance liabilities that result from the coverage it underwrites.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk  arises from changes to insurance regulations and supervisory regimes as well as from interactions with regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which Swiss Re operates.\n- \u00b7 Political risk  comprises the consequences of political events or actions that could have an adverse impact on Swiss Re's business or operations.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability risk  comprises the environmental, social and governance risks that may arise from individual business transactions or the way Swiss Re conducts its operations.\n- \u00b7 Strategic risk  represents the possibility that poor strategic decision making, execution or response to industry changes or competitor actions could harm Swiss Re's competitive position and thus its franchise value.\n\nSome of these risks are reflected indirectly in the risk model, as their realisations may be contained in the historical data and scenarios used to calibrate some of the risk factors. In addition, output from the model is used in measuring liquidity risk under stressed conditions.\n\nAs separate risk categories, these risks are an integral part of Swiss Re's risk landscape. They are monitored and managed within the Risk Management organisation, and included in risk reports to executive management and the Board at the Group and legal entity level.\n\nAcross all risk categories, Swiss Re actively identifies emerging risks and threats as part of its risk identification process; this includes new risks as well as changes to previously known risks that could create new risk exposures or increase the potential exposure or interdependency between existing risks.\n\nReputational risk is not considered a separate risk category but rather represents a possible consequence of any risk type in addition to the potential financial and compliance impact.",

The increase is further driven by the impact on exposure of reviewability parameter updates and lower interest rates.\n\n## Management\n\nLegal entity CROs are responsible for overseeing all life and health exposures written in their respective areas. Accumulated exposures across Swiss Re are monitored and controlled by Group Risk Management to ensure that they remain at an acceptable level for the Group.\n\nCosting actuaries and underwriters represent the first line of control for life and health risks. All transactions that could materially change risk at the Group level or for key legal entities require independent\n\nreview and sign-off by Risk Management before they can be authorised. This is part of a three-signature principle, under which key transactions must be approved by the Chief Pricing Office and Risk Management in addition to market units. For transactions of defined types and within defined limits, this may be applied through the approval of underwriting or pricing guidelines. For other transactions, the approval must be secured through a review of the individual transaction.\n\nSwiss Re's limit framework for life and health exposures includes risk limits for key risks, such as life (mortality trend and longevity combined), lethal pandemic, mortality trend, lapse, critical illness and income protection. Market exposure limits are in place for catastrophe and stop-loss business. Swiss Re pays particular attention to densely populated areas and applies limits for individual buildings to guard against risk exposure accumulations.",

        "page_content": "## Management of other significant risks\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe Group has implemented an internal control system to mitigate operational risks through three lines of control. This system assigns primary responsibility for identifying and managing operational risks to individual risk takers (first line of control), with independent oversight and control by the Risk Management and Compliance functions (second line of control) as well as Group Internal Audit (third line of control). Members of the Executive Committee are required to certify the effectiveness of the internal control system for their area of responsibility on a quarterly basis.\n\nOperational risk is inherent within Swiss Re's business processes. As the company does not receive an explicit financial return for such risks, the approach to managing operational risk differs from the approach applied to other risk categories. The purpose of operational risk management is not to eliminate risks but rather to identify and cost-effectively mitigate operational risks that approach or exceed Swiss Re's tolerance.\n\nRisk Management is responsible for monitoring and controlling operational risks based on a centrally coordinated methodology. This includes a pre-defined taxonomy that is used for identifying, classifying and reporting operational risks, as well as a matrix in which risks are assessed according to their estimated probability and impact. Risks are assessed for their residual economic, financial reporting, reputational and compliance impact, taking into account existing mitigation and controls.\n\nThe matrix is also used to assess residual exposures against Swiss Re's internal tolerance limits for operational risk. This limit represents the level of operational risk that the Board of Directors and executive management teams are willing to accept. Material risks that exceed or are approaching risk tolerance are reported to executive management and boards at the Group and legal entity level. In addition, executive management is required to implement mitigation strategies for all risks that are outside of operational risk limits in order to bring them back within internal tolerance limits.\n\nCyber risk and information security are a key focus of Swiss Re's operational risk controls. The Group performs an annual cyber risk assessment to determine the current maturity of controls; this is based on internationally recognised standards. The results of the assessment are shared with senior management, and mitigation activities to improve Swiss Re's cyber security resilience are coordinated by the Chief Security Officer.\n\nOperational events and issues are recorded and managed in a central Operational Risk Management system in order to address the identified problems and avoid the recurrence of similar events. The results are reviewed by the relevant CRO and reported to the company's management team and Board of Directors.\n\nThe pace of digital transformation has accelerated, driven by strategic initiatives that aim to scale up Swiss Re's offering of data-driven services and solutions, diversify the portfolio of products and distributors, as well as to automate and streamline financial reporting processes in preparation for IFRS 17.\n\nThese factors, alongside increasing geopolitical instability, have brought into focus risks around key people dependency, information security and third-party governance. These risks are being actively mitigated and closely monitored at executive management level.\n\n## Model risk\n\nSwiss Re uses models throughout its business processes and operations, in particular to price insurance products, value financial assets and liabilities, assess reserves and portfolio cash flows, and estimate risk and capital requirements. Model owners have primary responsibility for model-related risks and are required to adhere to a robust tool development process, including testing, peer review, documentation and sign-off. A similar process also applies to model maintenance.\n\nSwiss Re's model governance is based on Group-wide standards for model assurance. These standards seek to ensure that each model has a clear scope, is based on sound mathematical and scientific concepts, has been implemented correctly and produces appropriate results given the stated purpose. Furthermore, the calibration of model parameters (and the data on which the calibration relies) must be trustworthy, while expert judgments are required to be sensible, documented and evidenced.\n\nAnalytical or financial models that are used for costing, valuation and risk capital calculations are governed by Swiss Re's Group Model Risk Management Standards. Material models used for costing, valuation of reserves and assets as well as Swiss Re's internal risk model are validated by dedicated teams within Risk Management. These teams provide independent assurance that the framework has been adhered to, and also conduct independent validations. Swiss Re's internal risk model is also subject to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nModel-related incidents are captured within Swiss Re's operational risk framework. In addition, material model developments, incidents and risks are reported in regular risk updates to executive management and the boards of directors at the Group and legal entity level.\n\n## Valuation risk\n\nFinancial valuation risk is managed by internal and external portfolio managers, who ensure that valuations remain in line with the market. In addition, Swiss Re has a function within Financial Risk Management that independently assesses valuations and valuation techniques. This team performs independent price verification for financial risk positions to confirm that valuations are reasonable and ensure there are no material misstatements of fair value in Swiss Re's financial reports. The results of the independent price verification process are reviewed by the Asset Valuation Committee. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.",

        "page_content": "Reserve valuation risk is managed by Swiss Re's Actuarial Control function, with dedicated teams for property and casualty, and life and health valuation. These teams ensure that Swiss Re's reserve-setting process uses an appropriate governance framework, including defined accountabilities and decision-making processes for risk takers (as the first line of control) as well as for Actuarial Control. The framework ensures that there is independent assurance on the data, assumptions, models and processes used for valuation purposes. It also includes an independent assessment of the reserves to ensure that their level remains within a range of possible best estimates. Regular deep-dive investigations are performed into selected portfolios in order to review the appropriateness of both the reserves and the applied reserving approach. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nRegulatory developments and related risks that may affect Swiss Re and its subsidiaries or branches are identified, assessed and monitored as part of regular oversight activities. Swiss Re is actively engaged in a dialogue with relevant regulators to improve mutual understanding of the implications arising from new regulatory proposals. Periodic reports and recommendations on regulatory issues are provided to executive management and the Board of Directors at the Group and legal entity level.\n\nThe regulatory environment of the insurance industry continues to evolve on the national, regional and international level. While some regulatory changes create new business opportunities, others come with significant costs and business restrictions. Growing regulatory complexity, increased protectionism and a fragile global economy are persistent themes affecting regulation and the way Swiss Re operates worldwide.\n\nRegulatory efforts are becoming increasingly forward-looking, aimed at a broad range of emerging risks, both actual and perceived. If new regulation is not based on clearly understood risks with a view to materiality and proportionality, and if the resulting requirements are not harmonised with international standards and best practices, this may create an excessive burden for global insurers and lead to higher costs for policyholders. It remains a key priority for Swiss Re to highlight to regulators the negative impacts of market access restrictions or impediments to global risk diversification. At the same time, such risks are mitigated by seeking solutions that reduce the negative impact on Swiss Re and its clients.\n\nSeveral regulators - particularly in Europe and Asia, and more recently in the Americas - have developed specific expectations of how climate risks should be managed, and are implementing risk management guidelines and mandatory disclosure requirements. There is a risk that regulators single out climate-related and other sustainability risks, and move away from purely risk-based solvency requirements. Regulations in different jurisdictions continue to develop at various speeds and are not necessarily aligned.\n\nSwiss Re continues to advocate for a harmonised and gradual implementation of these requirements. New regulations should be in line with international standards and with widely accepted disclosure frameworks in order to avoid regulatory fragmentation and ensure that requirements are appropriate. The new global standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board support greater alignment across jurisdictions.\n\nSwiss Re consistently highlights the benefits of its industry's global business model. It advocates for the removal or reduction of market access barriers, so that policyholders, governments, taxpayers and national economies can fully benefit from international diversification and thus have access to reliable, sound and affordable risk cover and transfer.\n\n## Political risk\n\nPolitical developments can threaten Swiss Re's operating model but also open up new business opportunities for developing the business. The Group adopts a holistic view of political risk and analyses developments in various markets and jurisdictions, as well as cross-border issues such as war, terrorism, energy-related issues and international trade controls.\n\nSwiss Re's Political Risk Management function exercises oversight and control functions for named political risks (eg political risk insurance) by monitoring political risk exposures, and providing recommendations on particular transaction referrals and risk reporting. In addition, Political Risk Management sets political country risk ratings that cover political, war and security-related country risks, and are used to support risk control activities and inform underwriting and other decisionmaking processes of the Group.\n\nSwiss Re regularly identifies and assesses the impact of political risk on its business. It builds relationships that expand the company's access to information and intelligence, and enhances its methodologies and standards. For example, Swiss Re participates in specialist events hosted by institutions such as industry and risk management associations, and maintains relationships with political risk specialists in other industries, think tanks and universities, as well as with governmental and nongovernmental organisations.",

The Group has a long-standing commitment to sustainable business practices, active corporate citizenship, as well as good, transparent governance.\n\nPotential sustainability risks are mitigated through clear corporate values, active dialogue and engagement with affected external stakeholders, and robust internal controls. These include a Group-wide framework for environmental, social/ human rights and governance risks, the ESG Risk Framework. This framework is used to identify and address sustainability risks across Swiss Re's business activities where information granularity is available and allows for a meaningful ESG risk assessment. It comprises sustainabilityrelated policies - with pre-defined restrictions, underwriting criteria and quality standards - as well as a central due diligence process for related transactional risks.\n\nSustainability risks are monitored and managed by dedicated Swiss Re experts who are also responsible for maintaining the ESG Risk Framework. In addition, this unit supports Swiss Re's management and business strategy through tailored risk assessments and risk portfolio reviews. It fosters risk awareness through internal training and facilitates development of innovative solutions to address sustainability issues. Finally, it represents and advocates Swiss Re's position on selected sustainability risk topics to external stakeholders.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the ESG Framework and Swiss Re's sustainability practices in general, see the 2023 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nOverall responsibility for managing strategic risk lies with the Group Board, which establishes Swiss Re's overall strategy. The Boards of legal entities are responsible for the strategic risk inherent in their specific strategy development and execution. Strategic risks are addressed by examining multi-year scenarios, considering the related risks, as well as monitoring the implementation of the chosen strategy year by year in terms of the annual business plan.\n\nAs part of their independent oversight role, Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit are responsible for controlling the risk-taking arising from the implementation of the strategy.\n\n## Emerging risk\n\nAnticipating possible developments in the risk landscape is a central element of Enterprise Risk Management. Swiss Re promotes pre-emptive thinking on risk in all areas of the business in order to reduce uncertainty and diminish the volatility of the Group's results, while also identifying new business opportunities and raising awareness for emerging risks.\n\nFor this purpose, Swiss Re's risk identification processes are supported by a systematic framework that identifies, assesses and monitors emerging risks and opportunities across all areas of Swiss Re's risk landscape. This framework combines a bottom-up approach driven by employee input with regional and product-specific expertise on emerging risk. The resulting information is complemented with insights from external organisations such as think tanks, academic networks and international organisations, as well as from interaction with clients.\n\nFindings, including a prioritised overview of newly identified emerging risks and an estimate of their potential impact on Swiss Re's business, are reported to senior management, the respective business steering functions and other internal stakeholders.\n\nSwiss Re also publishes an annual emerging risk report (Swiss Re SONAR) to raise awareness within the Group and across the industry, and initiate a risk dialogue with key external stakeholders. To advance risk awareness across the industry and beyond, Swiss Re maintains regular exchanges on emerging risks with its clients and continues to participate actively in strategic risk initiatives such as the CRO Forum's Emerging Risk Initiative and the International Risk Governance Council.\n\nThe following emerging risks are deemed particularly important for Swiss Re's business:\n\n## Digitalisation risks\n\nDigitalisation continues to reshape markets. Across industries and organisations, artificial intelligence (AI) and other ground-breaking digital applications are being adopted at astonishing speed and ever-growing range. The digital transformation is revolutionising value creation and brings many new opportunities for the insurance industry and its clients. However, it also opens up new vulnerabilities and risks for them.",

For companies, including for Swiss Re, digital applications open up new, fast and cost-efficient avenues in areas such as client interaction and analytics. Being innovative by nature, all these new services also come with challenges in terms of investment, skills, strategy, acceptance etc. For example, the current rise of generative AI tests insurance operations in terms of data use, intellectual property or cyber security. Emerging risks from digitalisation can also impact claims and loss trends in underwriting portfolios.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re monitors, assesses and implements digital technology developments through dedicated R&D and risk management functions. New digital applications and data services are run through a digital governance framework, which defines processes, responsibilities and tools to evaluate and mitigate risks for technology and data-driven solutions across the organisation. Swiss Re Institute researches and publishes on digitalisation and its risks regularly. Swiss Re constantly translates its digital competence and risk insights into services and offerings for its clients.\n\n## Global supply chain risk\n\nMarkets, industrial production and trade rely on globalised supply chains. Disruptions have become more likely, with higher and longer business impacts due to increased interdependencies and economic pressure. Risk factors such as extreme weather events, critical waterway blockages, geopolitical conflicts, terrorism and pandemic lockdowns can cause huge delays and accumulate with cascading effects.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nDue to the interdependence of industries, economies and services, supply chain risk can have an impact on business interruption covers, but may also potentially affect - directly or indirectly - a wide range of insurance business and an insurer's operations.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re offers clients (insurers and corporates) bespoke supply chain risk data and modelling that can show interdependencies and risk propagation, and quantify impacts for hazardous events throughout a network. Through Risk Data Services (RDS), Corporate Solutions offers corporate clients bespoke risk insights, enabling assessments, mitigation strategies and options to improve supply chain resilience.\n\n## Widening protection gaps\n\nGlobally widening protection gaps in natural catastrophe, crop, mortality or health insurance are particularly prominent in emerging markets. Their growing populations are vulnerable to the environmental impact of climate change but large parts of these populations do not have access to - or the means to pay for traditional risk transfer solutions.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nProtection gaps reflect market potentials or untapped opportunities for insurers and reinsurers to provide financial resilience. It is thus a key business focus for Swiss Re to understand the reasons for these gaps and find ways to mitigate the resulting risk exposures.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re's Public Sector Solutions team works with governments and other stakeholders to build public-private partnerships. Together, they develop innovative solutions, such as parametric insurance, to mitigate increasing natural catastrophe exposures and other threats for largely unprotected populations.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about emerging risk, see the Swiss Re SONAR report.",

Swiss Re's Board of Directors is composed of 36.4% female and 63.6% male Board members.\n\n'Our simplified governance increases accountability and allows for faster decisions.'\n\n## Jacques de Vaucleroy\n\nVice Chairman of the Board of Directors\n\n## Modernised Articles of Association\n\nThe AGM 2023 approved the alignment of Swiss Re's Articles of Association with the revised Swiss Corporate Law, which entered into force on 1 January 2023. Approved changes include the introduction of a capital band replacing the authorised capital, AGM approval for the report on non-financial matters and the option to hold shareholders' meetings virtually.\n\n## Sustainability\n\nSustainability is a key corporate governance concern. Environmental, social and governance (ESG), diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as cyber security and data protection and an increasing focus on artificial intelligence (AI) governance, remain at the top of board agendas. Good governance is increasingly recognised by regulators as a crucial way to address the promotion of positive conduct and culture at firms. Please refer to the Sustainability Report 2023 for information on Swiss Re's sustainability governance.\n\n## Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee\n\nTo underline the importance of its sustainability-related work, the committee added Sustainability to its name in\n\nSeptember 2023. In addition to its tasks relating to general corporate governance and succession planning, the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee regularly monitors initiatives related to the Group Sustainability Strategy. It oversees the Group's approach to sustainability matters and related principles, and how they are embedded at all levels of the Group. It keeps itself abreast of the Group Sustainability Council's activities and oversees the integration of governance and operational aspects of sustainability, including initiatives and actions specifically addressing climate change.\n\n## Sustainability Report 2023\n\nPlease refer to Swiss Re's Sustainability Report for information on Swiss Re's approach to sustainability, including its governance around these matters. The Sustainability Report 2023 will be submitted to the AGM 2024 for a consultative vote.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Swiss Re's Sustainability Report\n\nwww.swissre.com/sustainabilityreport",

Nominees are entered in the share register with voting rights up to a maximum of 2% of the issued Swiss Re Ltd shares, without any further inquiry. For holdings above that threshold, nominees are only registered with voting rights if they disclose the names, addresses and shareholdings of any persons for whom the nominees are holding 0.5% or more of the issued Swiss Re Ltd shares. A group clause applies with respect to the nominee rules. The Articles of Association do not provide for exceptions, and no exceptions were granted in 2023. The Board of Directors can strike a shareholder with voting rights off the share register retroactively, if the entry was obtained under false pretences, or in the case of breach of disclosure rules (as more fully set out in Article 4 of the Articles of Association).

The Chair coordinates the work of the Board committees together with the respective chairs and ensures that the Board is informed about the committees' activities and findings. The Chair establishes and maintains close and constructive working relationships between the Board and the Group CEO and the other Group EC members. He or she does not participate in any form in Group EC meetings, discussions and/or the decisionmaking processes. Further, he or she presides over shareholders' meetings and represents the Swiss Re Group, besides the Group CEO, Group EC members and further key executives, towards its shareholders, in industry associations and in the interaction with other stakeholders such as the media and political and regulatory authorities, government officials and the public. At Swiss Re, the Chair role is not a full-time mandate, however, it requires a high level of availability, engagement and commitment. In accordance with the applicable legal requirements, the Chair is non-executive, he or she may not be a member of the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Vice Chair of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Vice Chair deputises for the Chair if the Chair is prevented from performing his or her duties or in a conflict of interest situation. The Vice Chair may prepare and execute Board resolutions at the request of the Board and liaises between the Board and the Group EC in matters not reserved to the Chair.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\nThe Vice Chair or another independent member of the Board of Directors assumes the role of the Lead Independent Director. He or she acts as an intermediary between the Swiss Re Group and its shareholders and stakeholders in the absence of the Chair or, in particular, if a senior independent member of the Board of Directors is required. He or she may convene and chair sessions of the Board where the Chair is not present. He or she communicates the outcome of these sessions to the Chair.\n\n## Board composition\n\n## Diversity\n\nDiversity is a priority for the Board of Directors. A diverse composition is indispensable for the successful and efficient fulfilment of the Board's responsibilities.\n\nDiversity considerations with regards to, among others, gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity and regional representation are a priority for the Board composition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Bylaws require that at least three-quarters of the Board members are independent. Swiss Re defines independence in line with legal requirements and best practice corporate governance standards. On that basis, the Board of Directors assesses its members' independence on an annual basis. The Vice Chairman (proposed for election as Chairman) and all other Board members, with the exception of Pia Tischhauser, meet Swiss Re's independence criteria. For further details please refer to the Bylaws (Article 3.2, available under the following link: www.swissre.com/bylaws). No Board member has ever held a management position within the Group or has or represents a company or organisation which has any significant business connections with Swiss Re, other than as disclosed in Note 18 to the Group financial statements on page 231 of this Financial Report.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are also subject to procedures to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with an interest of Swiss Re or gives the appearance of a conflict. For details on the procedures, please refer to the Bylaws (Article 21.2).\n\n## Election and term of office\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors, the Chair and the members of the Compensation Committee are elected\n\nannually and individually by the AGM for a term of office until completion of the next AGM. Swiss Re has a 12-year tenure limit in place for the Board mandate.\n\n## Nominations for AGM 2024 Chair of the Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes Jacques de Vaucleroy for election as non-executive and independent Chairman at the AGM 2024. Jacques de Vaucleroy has been a member of the Board of Directors since 2017. He chairs the Governance,\n\nNomination and Sustainability Committee. Jacques de Vaucleroy was appointed Vice Chairman effective after the AGM 2023. He has been leading the Board in his capacity as Vice Chairman since the resignation of the previous Chairman, Sergio P. Ermotti, on 30 April 2023. Since then, Jacques de Vaucleroy has stepped down from most of his external mandates to be able to dedicate the time and commitment required for this role. He also stepped down from his internal mandates as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Swiss Re Europe S.A. and Swiss Re International SE. For Jacques de Vaucleroy's biography, please refer to page 79 of this report. Please also see Swiss Re's announcement of 12 July 2023 (https://www.swissre.com/media/ press-release/pr-20230712-chairmanvaucleroy-press-release.html).\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes all current Board members for re-election at the AGM 2024. Furthermore, the Board of Directors proposes the election of Geraldine Matchett as a new Board member. Geraldine Matchett was Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer (CFO) at DSM-Firmenich Ltd (formerly Royal DSM N.V.) from 2020 to 2023, where she served as CFO from 2014 to 2020. Prior to that she was Global Chief Financial Officer and member of the Operations Council of the SGS Group in Switzerland. Geraldine Matchett is a Swiss, British and French citizen born in 1972. She holds a Master's degree in Sustainable Development from the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, and a Bachelor's degree in Physical and Human Geography from the University of Reading, United Kingdom.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes the re-election of all Compensation Committee members.",

Ryan Larry Zimpleman\n\n## Organisational principles\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nJay Ralph, chair Karen Gavan Deanna Ong Joerg Reinhardt\n\n## Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors constitutes itself after the AGM. It elects a Vice Chair and a Lead Independent Director among its independent members. Both roles can be filled by the same independent member. The Board of Directors also elects the chairpersons and members of the Board committees (other than the members of the Compensation Committee, who are elected by the AGM). It is the Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee which prepares these proposals. The Board of Directors appoints its secretary, who is also the secretary to the Board committees with the exception of the Compensation Committee. The Global Head Reward is the secretary of the Compensation Committee. In line with the Bylaws, the Board of Directors meets at the invitation of the Chair, as often as business requires but not fewer than six times a year. The tables on the next page provide an overview of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees in 2023 and show the overall and individual meeting attendance of the Board members.\n\nThe Board of Directors has delegated certain responsibilities to four Board committees. Depending on the responsibility, the Board committees have decision-making powers or act in an advisory capacity. The committees work on the basis of a charter, which forms part of the Bylaws. Each committee provides a report on its activities, proposals and recommendations following a committee meeting at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. If any significant topic emerges, the committees contact the Board of Directors immediately. It is the responsibility of each committee to keep the Board of Directors informed in a timely manner. Please refer to pages 88-89 for an overview of the Board committees' responsibilities, members and key focus areas in 2023.\n\nJoachim Oechslin, chair Jay Ralph Philip K.

        "page_content": "## Board member qualifications\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures that the necessary qualifications and skills are represented among its members to fulfil its oversight responsibility and enable sound and independent decision-making in line with the needs of the business. The Board aims to assemble a balance of managerial expertise and knowledge from different fields such as insurance and reinsurance, finance, accounting, capital markets, risk management, sustainability, digitalisation, legal, tax and regulatory as well as leadership and decision-making experience in a large, complex financial institution. Please refer to the table below for an overview on the representation of these skills in the Board. Board membership also demands significant commitment and availability. The selection of new Board members must additionally be guided by the principles of diversity, inclusion, transparency and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee supports the Board of Directors with succession planning at both Board and Group EC level. It regularly reviews the qualifications and skills represented in the Board and aligns them with best practice developments, stakeholder demands and changing business needs. It submits recommendations to the Board of Directors, which decides on the selection criteria used to assess potential candidates for Board membership. The\n\nGovernance,Nomination and Sustainability Committee initiates the evaluation of potential new Board members in a timely manner with the continued aim to ensure the Board members have the desired expertise and experience. Gender diversity is a top priority for the Board's succession planning. The Governance, Nomination and Sustainability Committee submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for new Board members and chairs. It is the Board which nominates candidates for chairing the Board and for Board membership for election and re-election by the AGM. The Board aims to ensure that it retains an adequate size and well-balanced composition.\n\n## Self-assessment\n\nAn open, transparent and critical board room culture forms the basis for the Board of Directors' annual review of its own performance and effectiveness. The Board of Directors annually evaluates its work and the performance of the Chair. The self-assessment includes a critical review of the Board's composition, organisation and processes, as well as the Board's responsibilities and duties. In addition, they evaluate if the goals for the year were achieved. The Board discusses these topics and defines take-aways which are incorporated into the goals for the following year, considered for the Board governance as well as for succession planning. Each Board committee also conducts an annual review of their work against their pre-set goals for the year.\n\n## Board skills, expertise and experience most relevant for Swiss Re\n\n(number of Board members per skill)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Reinsurance /insurance               | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c   |           |\n|--------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial services /asset management |           | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c  |\n| Risk management /finance /audit      |           | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c |\n| Human resources /compensation        | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c      |           |\n| Sustainability /corporate governance |           | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c  |\n| Regional experience                  | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c      |           |\n| Chair /CEO experience                | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c      |           |\n\n## Board members' training\n\nThe Board of Directors' key focus during this continuously challenging geopolitical and economic environment is keeping up with recent developments relevant for Swiss Re's businesses and managing the firm through significant challenges. Moreover, continued education remains an important priority for the BoD members. Educational sessions and topical deep dives form an integral part of the Board's agenda each year. In 2023, the Board members focused on learning more about the latest trends in technology, digitalisation, data and artificial intelligence; concluded a deep-dive on the transition to net-zero emissions; took part in a workshop with local management focusing on the businesses in the Asia-Pacific region and attended an IFRS 17 accounting framework session. In addition, the Risk Committee members were educated on the new investment process, focusing on the Long-term Strategic Asset Allocation & Reference Portfolio. Board members can also request individual educational sessions with key executives and experts on specific topics of interest and value at any time.\n\n## Board member onboarding\n\nIn 2023, the two newly appointed Board members underwent the established onboarding programme, which includes a set of training sessions and documents aimed at ensuring that incoming Board members have a comprehensive overview of the Group's organisation, businesses and environment.",

Such request must be in writing, stating the agenda items and the proposals to be submitted to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting.\n\n## Participation by electronic means\n\nThe Board of Directors may provide that shareholders' meetings are held simultaneously at different locations, provided that the contributions of the participants are transmitted directly in video and audio to all venues and that shareholders who are not present at the venue or the venues of the shareholders' meeting may exercise their rights by electronic means. Alternatively, the Board of Directors may also provide that the shareholders' meeting will be held by electronic means without a venue.\n\n## Request to place an item on the agenda\n\nShareholders with voting rights holding at least 0.3% of the share capital may, no later than 45 days before the date of the shareholders' meeting, request in writing that a particular agenda item, together with the relevant proposals, is included in the agenda. The same modalities apply for shareholders to request that proposals on agenda items are included.\n\n## Statutory quorum\n\nThe shareholders' meetings can pass resolutions regardless of the number of shareholders present or shares represented by proxies. The resolutions require an absolute majority of the votes validly cast, excluding blank and invalid ballots, except where the law requires a higher threshold.\n\nFor further information on shareholders' participation rights, please refer to the Articles of Association (in particular Articles 8, 9a, 10 and 11).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nwww.swissre.com/articles\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2024\n\nThe Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2024 will take place in the Hallenstadion, Zurich.

A company may, in its articles of association, raise this threshold to up to 49% of the voting rights (opting up) or, under specific circumstances, disapply the duty to make an offer (opting out). Swiss Re Ltd has not introduced such provisions, so that the statutory threshold of 33\u2153% applies.\n\n## Clauses on changes of control\n\nThe mandates and employment contracts of the members of the Board of Directors, the Group EC and further executive management members do not contain any provisions such as severance payments, notice periods of more than 12 months or additional pension fund contributions that would benefit them in a change of control situation.\n\nUnvested deferred compensation may vest and employee participation plan rules may be amended upon a change of control. In such an event, the rights of members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC, as well as of further executive management members, are identical to those of all other employees. Further information on clauses on changes of control are provided in the Compensation Report on page 120.",

        "page_content": "## External auditors\n\nKPMG was re-elected at the AGM 2023.\n\n## Duration of the mandate and term of the lead auditors\n\nBased on Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, the shareholders annually elect the external auditor. At the AGM on 12 April 2023, the shareholders re-elected KPMG AG, Zurich, as the external auditor for Swiss Re Ltd and the Swiss Re Group, for a one-year term of office, for the financial year 2024. KPMG had initially been elected as Swiss Re's external auditor for the financial year 2021. KPMG fully meets the strict requirements of Swiss Re. The Audit Committee has received confirmation from KPMG that it complies with the relevant independence requirements to exercise the mandate as Swiss Re's external auditor.\n\nFrank Pfaffenzeller and Eric Elman have served as KPMG's lead auditors since KPMG took office in 2021. In line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and to foster external auditor independence, each of the two lead auditors rotates out of his or her role after seven years.\n\nUnlike in the European Union, there is no law in Switzerland that provides for a mandatory rotation of the external auditor after a certain number of years. The Audit Committee monitors the performance of KPMG on an annual basis as described on the next page.\n\n## Supervision of the external audit process\n\nThe external auditor is accountable to the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors and ultimately to the shareholders. The Board of Directors reviews the external auditor's professional qualifications. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight. The Audit Committee liaises closely with the external auditor. The lead auditors participate as advisors at all Audit Committee meetings (for more information, see page 87). The Audit Committee reviews and approves all planned audit services and any non-audit services provided by the external auditor.\n\nIt discusses the results of annual audits with the external auditor, including reports on the financial statements, necessary changes to the audit plans and critical accounting policies. The external auditor shares with the Audit Committee its findings on the adequacy of the financial reporting process and the efficacy of the internal controls. It informs the Audit Committee about any differences of opinion between the external auditor and management encountered during the audits or in connection with the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Fees paid to the auditor\n\nThe fees (excluding value added tax) for professional services provided by KPMG in 2023 were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                        |   2022 |   2023* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Audit fees                                          |   27.5 |    37.4 |\n| Non-audit fees                                      |    6.4 |     6.6 |\n| Audit-related assurance services                    |    5.5 |     6.1 |\n| Services relating to corporate finance transactions |    0.3 |     0.3 |\n| Tax-related services                                |    0.1 |     0   |\n| Other non-audit services                            |    0.5 |     0.2 |\n| Total fees                                          |   33.9 |    44   |",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of the external auditor\n\nIn line with good corporate governance, the Audit Committee thoroughly evaluates the credentials of the external auditor annually based on the following key criteria: investment in the client relationship, quality of delivery, quality of the people and services, and focus on client value. The Audit Committee presents the findings of the evaluation to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's assessment of the external auditor is furthermore based on the external auditor's qualifications, independence and performance. The Audit Committee also evaluates the performance of the lead auditors annually.\n\nIf a new external auditor is to be proposed for election by the shareholders, it is the Audit Committee, which steers the selection process and recommends a firm to the Board to be nominated for election by the shareholders.\n\n## Quality control\n\nThe external auditor submits, at least once a year, a report to the Audit Committee describing its own quality control, including any material issues raised by its most recent internal reviews or inquiries or investigations by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years, as well as any steps taken to deal with any such issues.\n\n## Independence\n\nAt least once a year, the external auditor provides a formal written statement delineating all relationships with Swiss Re that might affect its independence. Any disclosed relationships or services that might interfere with the external auditor's objectivity and independence are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which then recommends appropriate action to be taken by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Reporting of the external auditor to the Audit Committee in 2023\n\n| Date         | KPMG reports                                                           | Topics covered                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 26 January   | 2022 Audit Update                                                      | Audit update including actuarial and other matters (including investments, tax and  internal controls), IFRS update, 2022 Fee Reporting and updates to the 2022 Audit Plan                                             |\n| 16 February  | Preliminary 2022 Audit Results                                         | Report on preliminary results of interim procedures, including actuarial and other matters  and draft 2022 Swiss Re Ltd (SRL) and Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (SRZ)  Group US GAAP and Swiss statutory Audit Reports |\n| 15 March     | 2022 Audit Results                                                     | 2022 audit results, including actuarial and other matters, Swiss statutory audit results and  IFRS update                                                                                                              |\n| 11 April     | Audit Update                                                           | Update on Audit Innovation and ESG                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| 3 May        | Q1 2023 Audit Report                                                   | Report on preliminary results of interim procedures, including actuarial and other matters,  IFRS update and Q1 2023 Fee Reporting                                                                                     |\n| 3 August     | Q2 2023 Audit Report  KPMG audit plan and audit fees (2023)            | Report on preliminary results of interim procedures, including actuarial and other matters,  Q2 2023 Fee Reporting                                                                                                     |\n| 27 September | Update on mandatory reporting on  non-financial matters in Switzerland | KPMG's role in Swiss Re's Sustainability Reporting Program                                                                                                                                                             |\n| 2 November   | Q3 2023 Audit Report                                                   | Report on preliminary results of interim procedures, including actuarial and other matters,  IFRS update and Q3 2023 Fee Reporting                                                                                     |\n| 5 December   | IFRS Update                                                            | KPMG's view on Group and local IFRS submissions                                                                                                                                                                        |\n\n## Performance\n\nThe performance assessment measures the external auditor's performance against a number of criteria, including understanding of Swiss Re's business; technical knowledge and expertise; comprehensiveness of the audit plans; quality of the working relationship with management and clarity of communication.

During 2023, the Compensation Committee met six times and passed five decisions by circular resolution. In this letter, I will provide a summary of the key activities engaged in by the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Compensation framework\n\nIn recent years, the Compensation Committee has implemented various changes to the compensation framework to ensure pay for performance and alignment of interests. As the revised framework has proven fit for purpose, 2023 was a year of stability with no major changes.\n\nDue to the transition from US GAAP to IFRS as of 1 January 2024, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and targets for in-flight and new plan cycles were reviewed, assessed and agreed. KPIs and targets that required replacement are expected to measure performance on a consistent basis. Please refer to page 129 for further details.\n\n## Board of Directors\n\nCompetitiveness of the Board of Directors' compensation was reviewed, resulting in a lower aggregate compensation for the\n\nmembers of the Board of Directors proposed for shareholders' approval at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) 2023 as well as at the AGM 2024. Please refer to page 116 for further details.\n\n## Group Executive Committee (Group EC)\n\nDuring 2023, the number of Group EC roles decreased from 13 to 11 following the reorganisation of the Group. The responsibilities of the Group Chief Underwriting Officer and the tasks of the Regional Presidents were reallocated as these roles no longer exist in the new organisational structure. The fixed compensation and variable long-term compensation for 2023 granted to the new and existing members of the Group EC was within the budget approved by the shareholders at the AGM 2022. Please refer to page 123 for further details.\n\n## Compensation outcomes\n\nCompensation decisions were made considering Swiss Re's overall performance in the reported year in which the Group met all compensation-related financial targets. This led to an increased Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool for the Group and the Group EC, including the Group CEO. The total API amount (including Deferred Share Plan/DSP) for 2023 for the Group EC (including the Group CEO) is proposed for\n\nshareholders' approval at the AGM 2024. The Compensation Committee considers this outcome as appropriately rewarding the contributions of the Group EC in leading Swiss Re through its recent reorganisation and achieving all compensation-related financial targets for the Group. The Group CEO's total compensation for 2023 increased solely as a result of a higher API amount (ie base salary and LSP grant remained at the same level compared with 2022), reflecting the Group's overall positive performance outcomes. Please refer to pages 120 and 127 for further details.\n\n## Further Compensation\n\n## Committee activities\n\n- \u00b7 Implement changes in this Compensation Report to reflect requirements under the revised Swiss corporate law applicable per 1 January 2023.\n- \u00b7 Review the appropriateness and effectiveness of the compensation framework for all employee groups.\n- \u00b7 Monitor and assess the impact of inflation on salary and total compensation levels.\n- \u00b7 Focus on business and individual performance differentiation through the API to closer align with Swiss Re's pay-for-performance culture.\n- \u00b7 Monitor pay equity together with market practices to ensure employees are treated fairly and review new regulatory requirements on pay transparency.",

        "page_content": "## 2023 Group business results and pay for performance\n\nThe compensation framework aims to promote sustainable performance and long-term shareholder value creation through key performance measures and equitybased compensation. For 2023, Swiss Re's commitment to pay for performance translated into the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 Overall performance: Compensation decisions were made considering Swiss Re's overall performance for the reporting year in which Swiss Re reported a US GAAP net income of USD 3.2 billion, above its target of USD 3.0 billion, a Return on Equity (ROE) of 22.3% and an Economic Net Worth (ENW) per share growth of 10.8% in line with the target of 10%. The Group's US GAAP and economic performance increased compared with 2022. The result was supported by improved underwriting margins, while higher interest rates drove an increase in investment income. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) reported a net income of USD 1.9 billion, primarily driven by a resilient underwriting performance and disciplined renewals. Strong margins and positive reserve developments in property and speciality lines helped offset reserve strengthening in the casualty business. In addition, the result was supported by a solid investment performance. Large natural catastrophe claims remained below the full-year budget. The reported P&C Re combined ratio was 94.8% for the full year, meeting the target of less than 95%. Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) reported a net income of USD 976 million, above the targeted net income of USD 900 million. The underlying result benefitted from active in-force portfolio management and a strong investment result which offset elevated mortality claims in the US. The economic performance of L&H Re reflected additional unfavourable assumption updates and adverse experience. Corporate Solutions reported a net income of USD 678 million, reflecting a steadily improved portfolio resilience driven by disciplined underwriting and portfolio steering. With a combined ratio of 91.7% for the full year, Corporate Solutions outperformed its target of less than 94.0% for 2023.\n- \u00b7 Annual bonus: Overall, 2023 was a successful year for Swiss Re, as the Group met all of its five KPIs relevant for the Group API pool. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors did not exercise any upward or downward discretion. The Group Business Performance Factor increased from 0.68 in 2022 to 1.10 for financial year 2023, which led to a corresponding increase of the Group API pool.\n- \u00b7 Deferred compensation: The Value Alignment Incentive (VAI) 2020 (awarded 2021) performance factor for the Swiss Re Group was 93.8% based on the average 2021-2023 previous years' business performance. The main drivers of the previous years' business losses were COVID-19-related losses, natural catastrophe and man-made losses, as well as reserve increases relating to economic inflation, adverse assumption and experience updates in L&H Re. The previous years' business performance in 2022 additionally included updates to the internal pandemic risk model and inflation scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Long-term incentive: Outcomes for the Leadership Share Plan (LSP) 2021 (vesting in March 2024) were below target for the three-year performance period, with a combined performance factor of 64.9%.\n\n## Shareholder engagement and Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe compensation framework and decisions received strong support from shareholders. At the AGM on 12 April 2023, shareholders approved all binding compensation-related motions and the 2022 Compensation Report was approved in a consultative vote.\n\nSwiss Re engaged directly with shareholders and proxy advisors, such as during the annual Chairman's Roadshow. Swiss Re's compensation framework (including potential changes to the framework), compensation-related decisions and the compensation disclosure approach were discussed. Further details on shareholder engagement are provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 103.\n\nDuring recent engagements with proxy advisors, the revision of the KPIs and associated targets under the Group's incentive plans (as a result of changing the accounting standard effective 1 January 2024) was discussed and the details are presented in this Compensation Report.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is grateful for the insightful engagement and continues to proactively consider shareholders' and proxy advisors' expectations.\n\nConsistent with last year and in line with Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, shareholders will be asked to vote on the following motions at the AGM 2024:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2024 to the AGM 2025.\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation and variable long-term compensation for the members of the Group EC for the financial year 2025.\n- \u00b7 Aggregate amount of variable short-term compensation for the members of the Group EC for the financial year 2023.\n\nFurthermore, the Compensation Report will be submitted to the shareholders for a consultative vote.\n\nThis Compensation Report complies with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Articles 734a to 734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations.\n\n13 March 2024\n\nJay Ralph Chair Compensation Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Swiss Re has a non-discriminatory approach to determining compensation and benefits at all levels. Key pillars of the approach are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSound governance around compensation decision-making and approvals to ensure appropriate checks and balances.\n\nCompensation ranges defined by job family or specialisation in the local market, which ensure that compensation for employees in the same country/location is set based on consistent benchmarks.\n\nAnnual review of individual salaries and target incentives to maintain internal pay equity and pay for performance.\n\nRegular statistical analysis using best practice methodologies to identify and address potential risks of bias.\n\nAn inclusive and diverse workforce is critical to the success of the business. Pay equity reviews are conducted regularly to address any potential pay disparities when comparing pay for people in similar roles, in the same country, at the same hierarchical level and with similar years of experience. These reviews did not reveal systemic bias. During the most recent review conducted and communicated to employees in June 2023, the global adjusted pay gap between men and women stood at 1.4% on average (a reduction of 0.3% compared with the prior year).\n\nAdditionally, line managers have selfservice dashboards available to analyse pay equity and compensation levels for their teams. These provide real-time insights at each stage of the employee lifecycle (hiring, promotion, change in role, etc) to address potential risks of bias in compensation setting.\n\nMore details on Swiss Re's initiatives fostering a diverse and inclusive culture are provided in the Sustainability Report available at www.swissre.com/sustainability.\n\n## Spotlight: strong link between compensation and performance criteria in the area of sustainability/ environmental, social and governance (ESG)\n\nSustainability/ESG is one of the drivers for compensation outcomes as Swiss Re considers defined sustainability criteria for all Business Units/Group Functions within the annual bonus allocation. Unlike longterm variable compensation that applies only to selected participants, sustainabilityrelated performance impacts compensation for all employees, including the Group EC, through the annual bonus. Additionally, some employees have sustainability/ESG criteria set at an individual level where this aligns to their role and responsibilities. Key considerations for defining the sustainability criteria are shown in the figure below.\n\n## Sustainability criteria in compensation\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Compensation philosophy and governance\n\n## Guiding principles of Swiss Re's compensation framework\n\nSwiss Re's compensation framework is designed to reflect the nature of its business by:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing a culture of sustainable performance with a focus on riskadjusted financial results.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring alignment of compensation to long-term business results and individual contribution, and recognising both what was achieved and how it was achieved.\n- \u00b7 Attracting, motivating and retaining the talent the Group needs to succeed globally.\n- \u00b7 Supporting Swiss Re's commitment to ensure equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.\n- \u00b7 Aligning the interests of employees with those of Swiss Re's shareholders and society at large.\n- \u00b7 Fostering compliance, supporting appropriate and controlled risktaking in line with Swiss Re's business and risk strategy, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nSwiss Re's total compensation is well balanced in terms of fixed versus variable compensation, and short-term versus long-term incentives. This encourages sustainable long-term performance and supports shareholder alignment. Complemented by pension plans and benefits, the total reward package is competitive in local labour markets.\n\n## Compensation Policy\n\nBuilding on the overarching compensation principles included in Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, the compensation framework is captured in the Swiss Re Group Compensation Policy (Compensation Policy). The Compensation Policy is implemented globally to the extent possible. Variations may apply at the regional, entity and Business Unit level to accommodate specific requirements, such as compliance with local regulations and talent management. The Compensation Policy governs the compensation structure and processes. It is reviewed at least every other year or upon material changes against FINMA requirements and further relevant regulations as appropriate.\n\n## Approval authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation at the Board of Directors and Group EC level is governed by Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, which include rules on:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual and binding approval by the AGM of the maximum aggregate amounts of compensation of members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC (Article 22).\n- \u00b7 The supplementary amount for changes in the Group EC if the maximum aggregate amount of compensation approved by the AGM is not sufficient to also cover compensation of a new Group EC member (Article 23).\n- \u00b7 The compensation principles for both the members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC covering short-term and long-term elements, performancerelated pay, payment in shares, financial instruments or units, compensation in kind or other types of benefits (Article 24).\n- \u00b7 The agreements with members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC, external mandates and credits and loans (Articles 25 to 27).\n\nSwiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association are complemented by stringent governance on compensation matters set out in the Bylaws of Swiss Re Ltd and in the Bylaws of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, including the Charter of the Compensation Committee. Authority levels are summarised in the table overleaf.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved an authority matrix that defines the limits to which each level of management can authorise compensation payments. The Group CEO, the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, each approve compensation that exceeds the pre-set limits. The Group CEO is not involved in decision-making concerning his own compensation. The Board of Directors also establishes and periodically reviews Swiss Re's compensation framework (including guidelines and performance criteria) and prepares the compensationrelated proposals to the AGM.\n\nFurther details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 87-89 and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/ articles and www.swissre.com/bylaws.",

It operates as the Group's compensation committee and oversees the compensation framework applied at all entities of the Swiss Re Group. Until 12 July 2023, the Compensation Committee consisted of five independent members of the Board of Directors. Thereafter, the Compensation Committee comprised four independent members, as Jacques de Vaucleroy stepped down as chair and member of the Compensation Committee, following the proposal for his election as the new Chairman at the upcoming AGM in April 2024.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has an annual agenda to ensure that important reviews take place at the right times throughout the year, including the oversight of each stage of the compensation cycle. The Compensation Committee also commits time to executive sessions and conducts a periodic self-evaluation to preserve its high level of effectiveness. During 2023, the Compensation Committee held six meetings and provided updates to the Board of Directors on topics discussed, decisions made and items for approval after each of these meetings. In addition, the Compensation Committee passed five decisions by circular resolution.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Group CEO and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services participate in the Compensation Committee meetings. Other members of\n\nsenior management may attend as deemed appropriate and upon invitation by the chair of the Compensation Committee. Management members do not attend when their own compensation is discussed. The Global Head Reward serves as the Secretary to the Compensation Committee and attends its meetings (excluding the executive sessions).\n\nFurther details on the Compensation Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 87-89 and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/ bylaws, including the Charter of the Compensation Committee.",

PwC advised on topics including remuneration trends, (executive) compensation, market intelligence and best practices, while also participating in the Compensation Committee meetings. In addition, Mercer delivered compensation benchmarking data and Niederer Kraft Frey Ltd gave legal advice, mainly about specific aspects of executive compensation and labour law, regulatory compliance, plan rules and disclosure matters. The advisors may also have other mandates with Swiss Re. The Compensation Committee reviews the external advisors' role and mandate on a regular basis.\n\n## Additional safeguards in governing compensation: Control Functions and key risk takers\n\nSwiss Re bears risks in the course of its business activities, including market, credit and liquidity, underwriting, operational (including legal and compliance) and reputational risk. Group Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit annually perform an independent\n\nassessment of risk- and control-related behaviours of the Group and each of the Business Units/Group Functions, and of Swiss Re's Key Risk Takers individually. These reports are delivered to key executives including the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services. The risk- and control-related behaviour assessment of Group and Business Units/Group Functions provides additional input to determine the Group Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool and its allocation to each Business Unit/ Group Function. The assessment results of each Key Risk Taker serve as additional input when considering individual performance and compensation outcomes.\n\nTo ensure meaningful assessments and the continued independence of Control Functions (defined as Group Risk Management, Compliance, Group Internal Audit and Appointed Actuaries), the aggregate API pool for each Control Function and individual compensation for the Head of the respective Control Function are approved at Board level.\n\n## Prohibition of personal hedging strategies\n\nAny use of personal hedging strategies or remuneration and liability-related insurance that could undermine the risk alignment effects and economic exposure embedded in compensation arrangements is prohibited.\n\n## Non-applicability/ negative disclosure\n\nIt is expressly noted that any remuneration that is prohibited according to Article 735c of the Swiss Code of Obligations and that is not contained or not mentioned in this Compensation Report, is either nonapplicable or its omission is to be considered as declaration that such remuneration is not provided to current and former members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC.",

        "page_content": "## Board compensation\n\n## Compensation framework for the Board of Directors\n\nThe objective of compensating members of the Board of Directors is to attract and retain experienced individuals who are highly motivated to perform a critical role in the strategic oversight of Swiss Re and to contribute their individual business experience and expertise.\n\nThe fee structure for the members of the Board of Directors takes into account their long-term contribution to Swiss Re's success and achieves strong alignment with shareholder interests:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard members receive no variable or performance-based compensation.\n\nFees are delivered 60% in cash (three instalments) and 40% in shares (two instalments).\n\nShares are subject to a four-year blocking period.\n\nFee levels vary to reflect roles, responsibilities and time commitment, for instance due to committee memberships that differ in meeting frequency or duration. The fee level for each member of the Board of Directors is reviewed annually and benchmarked regularly by an external provider. Benchmarking is conducted against the same peer group used for the Group EC benchmarking (for further information on the peer group, please refer to page 120 of this Compensation Report) and against Swiss Market Index companies.\n\nA minimum Swiss pension fund solution is provided to members of the Board of Directors who are not exempted from mandatory occupational benefit plans in Switzerland. This is offered by an established external provider and applies only to a limited number of individuals depending on their personal situation due to which local law imposes such a pension solution. Pension contributions are split equally between Swiss Re and the respective individual. Contributions made by Swiss Re are included in the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval.\n\n## Changes to Board fees\n\nAs of the AGM 2023 held on 12 April 2023, the following fees were revised:\n\n- \u00b7 the Chairman's fee was decreased from CHF 3.8 million to CHF 3.6 million;\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director's/Vice Chairman's fee was decreased from CHF 125 000 to CHF 50 000 for the period between the AGM 2023 and 30 April 2023;\n- \u00b7 the Lead Independent Director's fee was set at CHF 50 000 for the period following 12 July 2023;\n- \u00b7 the Audit Committee chair's fee was decreased from CHF 425 000 to CHF 300 000;\n- \u00b7 the Investment Committee and the Finance and Risk Committee were dissolved and merged into the new Risk Committee, which covers the key activities of both previous committees. The resulting Risk Committee member's fee was set at CHF 75 000 (previously CHF 50 000 each for the Finance and Risk Committee and the Investment Committee member's fee).\n\n## Fees information relevant for AGM 2023-AGM 2024 term of office\n\nDue to the changes in the composition of the Board of Directors during the term of office between AGM 2023-AGM 2024, the fees for some members of the Board of Directors were pro-rated or adjusted accordingly. All changes are summarised below and are contained in the disclosure tables on the following pages:\n\n- \u00b7 Sergio P. Ermotti stepped down from the Board of Directors as of 30 April 2023 and his fee was pro-rated for the period between the AGM 2023 and 30 April 2023 on the basis of a 25% work degree.\n- \u00b7 Jacques de Vaucleroy held mandates as Vice Chairman, Lead Independent Director, chair of the Compensation Committee and member of the Governance and Nomination Committee between the AGM 2023 and 11 July 2023. The underlying fees including the base fee were pro-rated for the period between the AGM 2023 and 30 April 2023. Effective 1 May 2023, Jacques de Vaucleroy led the Board of Directors in his capacity as Vice Chairman and his fees were replaced with an ad-interim monthly fee of CHF 250 000 to account for the increased responsibility and time commitment.\n\n34.0\n\n29.9\n\n34.0\n\n## Board of Directors 34,0 29.9\n\nTerm of office: AGM 2023-AGM 2024 29,9 34,0\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCHF millions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMaximum aggregate amount approved 7.5 9.2\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAmount paid/granted\n\n- \u00b7 Joerg Reinhardt became the Lead Independent Director effective 12 July 2023 with the underlying fee pro-rated for the period between 12 July 2023 and the AGM 2024.\n- \u00b7 Jay Ralph became the chair of the Compensation Committee effective 12 July 2023 and his Compensation Committee member and chair fee were pro-rated for the respective periods.\n- \u00b7 Pia Tischhauser waived all fees for the term of office between AGM 2023AGM 2024 in line with the agreement between her and her current employer.\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nThe majority of the board members at subsidiary level are Swiss Re executives who do not receive any additional compensation for their services in these roles. When a member of the Board of Directors also serves on the board of a subsidiary, the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval also includes such subsidiary board fees.\n\n## Say on pay\n\nAt the AGM 2023, shareholders approved a maximum aggregate amount of compensation of CHF 9.2 million for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2023 to the AGM 2024. The compensation paid to the 12 members of the Board of Directors, out of which 11 served a full term of office, from the AGM 2023 to the AGM 2024 was CHF 7.5 million and therefore within the approved amount.\n\nFurther details on the compensation for members of the Board of Directors are provided in the tables on the following page. Currency conversions are calculated using December 2023 year-to-date FX rates for 2023 and 2024 figures, and December 2022 year-to-date FX rates for 2022 figures, where relevant.\n\n29,9",

The stock ownership guidelines define the following target ownership levels by role:\n\n- \u00b7 Group CEO: five times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other Group EC members: two times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other key senior executives: one time annual base salary.\n\nThe target has to be achieved within five years. All vested shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the relevant individual and related parties as well as share units not subject to performance conditions granted to the relevant individual count towards the requirements under the stock ownership guidelines. Compliance is reviewed on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Compensation Committee, which decides on appropriate actions as needed. During the 2023 assessment, all Group EC members fulfilled the applicable stock ownership guidelines.\n\nAs Swiss Re believes that a meaningful stock ownership position is essential for alignment with the interests of shareholders, restrictions on cash payouts may apply in case of non-compliance.",

This peer group is regularly reviewed by the Compensation Committee to ensure its relevance. The 2023 peer group consists of the following globally active primary insurance and reinsurance firms: Allianz SE, American International Group Inc, Aviva PLC, AXA SA, Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group, Hannover Rueck SE, Manulife Financial Corporation, Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG, Reinsurance Group of America Inc, Renaissance Re Holding Ltd, SCOR SE and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.\n\n## Employment conditions and clauses on changes of control\n\nThe Group EC members, including the Group CEO, have open-ended employment agreements with notice periods of 12 months for termination by either the company or the individual. Their employment agreements comply with the Swiss Code of Obligations. They do not contain severance clauses, any special provisions on the cancellation of contractual arrangements, agreements concerning special notice periods, waivers of lock-up periods for options, shorter vesting periods, additional contributions to pension funds or any other provisions protecting against changes of control ('golden parachutes').\n\nGroup EC members are covered by the Group's standard defined contribution pension plans. Information on the mandates of the Board of Directors and the employment contracts of the executive management is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 100.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the rights of members of the Group EC are identical to those of all other employees as governed by VAI, DSP and LSP plan rules. Specifically, the Board of Directors may decide at its discretion on the continuation, acceleration, amendment or removal of any vesting, blocking or exercise conditions for the payment or grant of deferred compensation. It may also decide to replace any DSP or LSP award with shares of the entity assuming control. In addition, it may apply any other measure which it considers equitable and reasonable, provided this does not constitute impermissible compensation pursuant to the Swiss Code of Obligations. Should the Board of Directors decide to accelerate vesting, performance factors will generally be based on the latest performance estimates available. Information on the quantitative impact of vested shares is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 77.\n\n## Compensation for the highest-paid member of the Group EC\n\nThe table below shows the compensation paid to Christian Mumenthaler, Group CEO.

These changes resulted in a significant simplification and delayering of the organisation, bringing us closer to clients to serve them better. This was also supported by the Group CEO's unabated client centricity, which was again reflected in the very strong scores received in independent client surveys.\n\nAt the same time, the focus on underwriting discipline and profitable growth has been re-emphasised through the reorganisation, reflected in the P&C renewals during the year and the overall financial results. The Group CEO also oversaw the smooth transition to the new Chief Investment Officer. Furthermore, he exercised diligent cost discipline in an inflationary environment.\n\niptiQ continued to grow its business in 2023, increasing its in-force policies to 2.7 million from 2.2 million in the previous year, but still reported a significant negative result. The expansion of the Reinsurance Solutions division and of Corporate Solutions' differentiated offering to corporate clients are progressing. All of these areas will require continued attention from the Group CEO.\n\nThe foundation for the transition from US GAAP to IFRS has been established, despite various technological and data challenges. This transition, which will be beneficial to our earnings and balance sheet strength, remains a key focus area.\n\nThe Group CEO continued his strong personal engagement on sustainability and further enhanced Swiss Re's profile as a prominent participant in public discussions, particularly in key focus areas such as the net-zero transition and societal resilience. He oversaw progress towards Swiss Re's net-zero commitments, including carbon intensity reductions on the assets side, and the publication of new carbon targets for select single risk portfolios on the liabilities side. In 2023, the Group met the reduction target for absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from business air travel compared with the 2018 reference year, even though travel restrictions stemming from the pandemic were lifted globally.\n\nIn an increasingly complex and controversial environment, the Group delivered against the 2023 targets and ambitions as defined in the Group Sustainability Report. Externally, Swiss Re is recognised as a leading re/insurer across ESG dimensions as reflected in the MSCI AAA rating and in the Sustainalytics ESG Risk Rating (7th percentile within the insurance industry).\n\nThe Group CEO further advanced gender balance for senior management, and the representation of women in the Group EC increased from 15% to 27%.\n\n| Qualitative performance  achievement   | 110.0% (minimum 0%, maximum 200%)   |                                                                                                                                         |\n|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Individual   scorecard factor          | 1.12                                | Based on 70% weighting for financial performance  achievements and 30% weighting for qualitative   performance achievements.            |\n| Resulting API   for the Group CEO      | CHF 2 800 000                       | Calculated by multiplying the Target API of CHF 2 500 000  with the individual scorecard factor, rounded up to the next  five thousand. |",

The amount of CHF 28.8 million paid and effectively granted to the Group EC members during the financial year 2023 consists of:\n\n- \u00b7 CHF 14.6 million fixed compensation;\n- \u00b7 CHF 12.8 million variable-long term compensation; and\n- \u00b7 CHF 1.4 million for compensation due to members leaving.\n\nIt includes compensation and associated costs in relation to the period in a Group EC position for one individual who joined the Group EC during the year. In the course of 2023, the number of Group EC roles decreased from 13 to 11 following the reorganisation of the Group. These changes were not known at the time of the AGM 2022. Details are provided in the table below.\n\nThe 2023 figures cover payments to 14 individuals who held a Group EC position at any point in 2023 (including the Group CEO), of whom ten were active on the Group EC for the full year.

        "page_content": "## Group EC performance\n\n## assessment and compensation\n\nThe performance of each Group EC member is generally assessed by means of an individual scorecard comprising a set of quantitative and qualitative KPIs. These KPIs are typically agreed at the beginning of the performance year and are derived from the Group's strategy and the Group CEO's objectives.\n\nAs of performance year 2023, the Group EC members' performance assessment approach has been further aligned with that of the Group CEO: all five Group financial KPIs as well as the key qualitative areas\n\nStrategic initiatives and ESG overlap to underpin their shared accountability for the Group's results. More information can be found in the table below.\n\nThe individual scorecard is the starting point for the individual Group EC members' API determination, thereby directly impacting the Group EC members' total compensation. The Group CEO retains discretion to adjust any of the factors of the individual scorecard if warranted, for instance to account for the individual's contribution, behaviour or special circumstances such as individuals joining/ leaving the Group EC or changing\n\nresponsibilities. The API amount is capped at two times Target API with an additional cap of three times base salary for Group EC members.\n\nThe Compensation Committee subsequently reviews the effectiveness of the Group's performance management process and challenges compensation proposals for the Group EC members. The assessment with the proposed API amount for each Group EC member is approved by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Group EC scorecard structure for determining discretionary API\n\n|                                | % of API opportunity   | % of API opportunity   |                                                                                 |\n|--------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Factor                         | Business Unit          | Group Function         | KPIs                                                                            |\n| Group financial factor         | 35%                    | 50%                    | Same KPIs and weightings as the Group CEO financial factor: \u00b7  Net income - 35% |\n|                                |                        |                        | \u00b7  ENW per share growth - 20%                                                   |\n|                                |                        |                        | \u00b7  Net income L&H Re - 15%                                                      |\n|                                |                        |                        | \u00b7  Reported CR P&C Re - 15%                                                     |\n|                                |                        |                        | \u00b7  Reported CR CorSo - 15%                                                      |\n| Business Unit financial factor | 35%                    | 0%                     | For Business Units, unit-specific financial KPIs are considered                 |\n| Qualitative factor             | 30%                    | 50%                    | Several KPIs are defined with priority on: \u00b7  Strategic initiatives \u00b7  ESG      |\n\n## Group EC performance outcomes\n\nA key focus for the Group EC was to drive and successfully complete the reorganisation without disruption, leading to significant reductions in managing director positions, reduction in committee time at the executive level and cost savings. Another key priority was maintaining the focus on strong underwriting quality in the aftermath of hurricane Ian and continued challenges from social inflation in US liability. The Group EC continued to drive preparations to adopt IFRS as ts reporting framework as of 1 January 2024 with key decisions for transition and future steering assessed and decided throughout the year. In terms of financial performance, 2023 was a strong year in which the Group managed to achieve all its external targets (US GAAP and EVM).\n\n## 2023 aggregate amount of Group EC variable short-term compensation\n\nFor 2023, the Group EC target API pool (pro-rata amount in relation to the active period on the Group EC, including the Group CEO) amounted to CHF 14.7 million compared with CHF 15.2 million in 2022. The decrease is primarily due to one Group EC member leaving, who forfeited the API in line with the applicable termination provisions and the gradual decrease of Group EC roles from 13 to 11 in the course of 2023. For the Group CEO, the Target API was CHF 2.5 million (no change compared with 2022).\n\nThe proposed total API amount (including DSP) for 2023 for the Group EC (including the Group CEO) is CHF 15.0 million (subject to shareholder approval at the AGM 2024) and includes pro-rata payments in relation\n\nto the active period on the Group EC for individuals who joined or left the Group EC in 2023. This represents an increase of CHF 5.8 million compared with the approved total 2022 API amount (including DSP) of CHF 9.2 million for the Group EC. The increase is primarily attributable to strong financial performance in 2023 as the Group achieved all its external targets. This is also reflected in the higher Group Business Performance Factor (1.10 in 2023 compared with 0.68 in 2022).\n\nAfter carefully considering the performance of the Group EC in 2023, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that the proposed amount is proportionate given the overall achievements of the Swiss Re Group and the business environment, and is in alignment with shareholder interests.",

Combined with the base salary, it provides competitive total cash compensation for achievements against both business and individual performance targets and for the demonstration of desired behaviours.\n\nSwiss Re's API pool is funded based on financial performance outcomes, which strengthens the link between pay and performance. The financial performance assessment considers five financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with Contribution to ENW and Capitalisation level as Group targets complemented by three segment targets. The KPIs are\n\nreviewed on an annual basis. The resulting Group Business Performance Factor (BPF) is calculated through a financial model with the achievement being capped to avoid a disproportionate pool.\n\nThe Compensation Committee can apply discretion (eg to protect the franchise or ensure affordability) to make an upward or downward adjustment to the Group API pool recommended for approval to the Board of Directors. If discretion is applied, this is disclosed.\n\nBased on the respective financial and qualitative performance, the Group CEO then splits the Group API pool into pools for each Business Unit/Group Function, an aggregate pool for the Group EC and one for other key executives. Such assessment considers dimensions aligned with Swiss Re's priorities, including unit-specific financial metrics, risk and control behaviours and sustainability/ESG targets.\n\n## Business Units/Group Functions allocation\n\n## Financial dimensions\n\nPre-set metrics and targets may comprise unit-specific targets, such as combined ratio.\n\n## Qualitative dimensions\n\nDefined KPIs and measurable targets, across dimensions such as: Strategic initiatives; Sustainability; People metrics; Operational excellence and franchise value (including risk and control behaviours).\n\nUpon approval by the Board of Directors, the Group API pool is allocated to the Business Units/Group Functions.\n\n## Individual allocation\n\n## Individual performance\n\nIndividual performance is assessed against objectives achieved and demonstration of desired behaviours that are aligned to Swiss Re's purpose and business strategy.\n\nThe actual API payout is linked both to Swiss Re's business results and to individual performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The API for each employee is determined based on their Target API, individual performance and performance of the Business Unit/Group Function the employee belongs to. Individual performance is assessed against individual goals and Swiss Re's behaviour expectations and corporate values, all aligned to Swiss Re's business strategy. Swiss Re's 'leadership from every seat' philosophy, as part of which desired behaviours are clearly articulated, is embedded in the continuous performance management and feedback discussions. This allows for forward-looking conversations that foster real-time improvement and adaptation to business needs. Herewith, Swiss Re ensures robust performance differentiation and transparent pay for performance. When the total API level for an employee equals or exceeds a pre-defined amount, a portion is deferred into the Deferred Share Plan (DSP). The non-deferred portion is settled in immediate cash (cash API).\n\n## Limitations to avoid excessive payouts\n\nAPI awards to individuals are capped at two times Target API. For Group EC members an additional cap of three times annual base salary is applied. Both the Group API pool as well as an individual API can be reduced to zero. Forfeiture of unsettled awards and clawback provisions for settled awards apply in a range of events, enabling Swiss Re to seek repayment where appropriate. Examples of such events are acts which can be considered as malfeasance, fraud or misconduct.\n\n## 2023 API outcomes\n\n2023 was a successful year, characterised by improved price adequacy in the property and casualty business and the higher interest rate environment. The main performance outcomes include:\n\n- \u00b7 Contribution to ENW was at 10.3%, reflecting strong new business performance from P&C Re, L&H Re and Corporate Solutions as well as a good investment result. This was partially offset by a loss from previous years' business, driven primarily by L&H Re due to assumption updates and adverse experience.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re's capital position remained very strong, with the Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio of 306% above the 200-250% target range performance, reflecting increased interest rates as well as good investment and underwriting results.\n- \u00b7 L&H Re reported a net income of USD 976 million for 2023, above the targeted net income of USD 900 million. The underlying result benefitted from active in-force portfolio management and a strong investment result which offset elevated mortality claims in the US.\n- \u00b7 P&C Re's reported combined ratio of 94.8% delivered against its target of less than 95%, primarily driven by a resilient underwriting performance and disciplined renewals. Strong margins and positive reserve developments in property and speciality lines helped offset the adverse impact of the casualty business. Large natural catastrophe claims remained below the full-year budget.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Solutions' combined ratio was 91.7%, outperforming the external target of less than 94%, reflecting a steadily improved portfolio resilience driven by disciplined underwriting and portfolio steering.\n\nNext to financial achievements driving the funding, the proposed Group BPF was also evaluated in the broader context, including affordability, proportionality of value sharing, risk and control behaviours, sustainability/ ESG and other qualitative dimensions, as relevant. The Board of Directors applied no upward or downward discretion and approved the Group BPF of 1.10.\n\n## Deferred compensation: DSP\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Deferred Share Plan (DSP) is a mandatory three-year deferral of a portion of the API when the total API amount for an employee equals or exceeds the threshold. The higher the API granted, the greater the amount of compensation that remains at risk through deferral into the DSP as shown in the table below.\n\nThe DSP supports Swiss Re's performance culture, as the ultimate value of the deferred variable compensation depends on Swiss Re's future performance and value creation reflected in Swiss Re's share price.\n\n## Portion of API that is deferred into the DSP\n\n| Group CEO                | 50% of API                                                                                                              |\n|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other Group   EC members | 45% of API                                                                                                              |\n| Other key   executives   | 40% of API                                                                                                              |\n| All other  employees     | 50% of the API amount  exceeding USD 150 000   with a minimum deferral  amount of USD 5 000 at  USD 150 000 and up to a |",

Each awarded share unit is entitled to a dividend equivalent accrued annually during the vesting period and without reinvestment.\n\nFor the full three-year vesting period, forfeiture conditions apply. Additionally, clawback provisions apply in a range of events as defined in the DSP plan rules. Swiss Re also allows for DSP participants to have shares sold or automatically settled on a net basis as applicable, to cover statutory tax and social security liabilities that may arise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Performance outcomes for the VAI 2020\n\nThe Value Alignment Incentive/VAI (granted until performance year 2021) was the mandatory cash deferral of a portion of the API subject to the three-year average of the published Economic Value Management (EVM) previous years' business profit margin.\n\nThe VAI 2020 (awarded 2021) performance factor for the Swiss Re Group was 93.8% based on the average 2021-2023 previous years' business performance. The previous years' business losses were predominantly driven by losses and reserve increases. These included COVID-19-related losses in L&H Re mainly in the year 2021. In addition, updates to the internal pandemic risk model in L&H Re and inflation scenarios in P&C Re\n\nas well as reserve increases relating to inflation scenarios for P&C Re and Corporate Solutions impacted the results in 2022. The previous years' business performance in 2023 also showed losses, especially in L&H Re, with significant adverse assumption and experience updates. This led to performance factors ranging from 74.8% (iptiQ) to 109.9% (Corporate Solutions).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Illustrative example of realised performance for the VAI 2020 (awarded 2021)\n\nGranted and realised VAI are shown on the right for a grant of CHF 100 000 on the VAI 2020 (awarded 2021).

        "page_content": "## Long-term incentive: LSP\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the Leadership Share Plan (LSP) is to provide an incentive for Swiss Re's senior management (including the members of the Group EC) to achieve sustainable company performance over the long term. The LSP is a discretionary, forward-looking instrument awarded to incentivise decision-making that is also in the shareholders' interest. The design of the LSP aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Direct participants' energies on earnings, capital efficiency and Swiss Re's position against peers, all of which are critical to sustain shareholder value creation.\n- \u00b7 Focus participants' attention on longterm forward-looking business growth.\n- \u00b7 Attract and retain individuals with exceptional skills.\n- \u00b7 Provide competitive compensation that rewards long-term performance.\n\n## Design\n\nGrant levels are determined based on multiple factors including the role being performed and market benchmarks. The size of the LSP pool is reviewed each year in the context of sustainable business performance, affordability and market competitiveness, and funded as part of the Group's total variable compensation pool.\n\nFor Group EC members and other key executives, the award value is split into two underlying Performance Share Units (PSUs) at the grant date. For other eligible employees, the award value is either split into 50% PSUs and 50% Share Units (SUs), or granted in 100% SUs. A valuation by HCM International Ltd (HCM) is used to determine the number of PSUs to be granted. The number of SUs is determined using the average of the closing share prices of 30 trading days prior to the date of grant, as SUs are not subject to performance conditions. The SUs granted under the LSP are entitled to a dividend equivalent accrued annually during the vesting period and without reinvestment.\n\nThe vesting period, during which performance is measured, is three years. For LSP awards granted to Group EC members and other key executives, the duration of the LSP is five years, comprising a three-year vesting and performance measurement period and an additional two-year holding period.\n\nAt the end of the three-year (performance) measurement period, PSUs and SUs will be settled in shares where legally permissible. For the full three-year vesting period, forfeiture conditions apply. Additionally, clawback provisions apply in a range of events as defined in the LSP plan rules.\n\nSwiss Re also allows for LSP participants to have shares sold or automatically settled on a net basis as applicable, to cover statutory tax and social security liabilities that may arise.\n\n## Impact of accounting standard transition on the in-flight plan cycles\n\nAs a result of the transition from US GAAP to IFRS as of 1 January 2024, and the decommissioning of Economic Value Management (EVM), Swiss Re's proprietary integrated economic valuation and steering framework, the Compensation Committee was faced with a necessary revision of the KPIs and associated targets under the in-flight Group incentive plans. As the original KPIs will no longer be reported, the Compensation Committee has sought to identify the closest available replacements. Where needed, targets were adjusted in a purely mechanical way to ensure that these remain as challenging as intended and are not affected (either positively or negatively) by the transition to IFRS; HCM and PwC (PwC as part of their ongoing advisor role to the Compensation Committee) commented on the reasonableness of the principles and methodology that were adopted without performing an in-depth financial recalculation. The changes are summarised in the table below.\n\n| Plans                                                                | KPIs adjustment and impact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Target adjustments                                                                                                                                                                           |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| LSP 2022 granted in April 2022:  2024 performance tranche            | \u00b7  ENW growth is substituted with the IFRS substance  value growth (Group net income plus change in  Contractual Service Margin (CSM; post tax) divided by  sum of the opening balance of Shareholder's Equity and  CSM, post tax). \u00b7  US GAAP Return on Equity (ROE) is substituted with  IFRS ROE. | IFRS substance value growth   (vs original ENW growth target) 0% for growth at 0% (unchanged) 100% for growth of 8% (from ENW growth of 10%) 150% for growth at 12% (from ENW growth of 15%) |\n| LSP 2023 granted in April 2023:  2024 and 2025 performance  tranches | \u00b7  US GAAP Return on Adjusted Equity (ROAE) is substituted  with IFRS ROE.  \u00b7  Target levels are based on the estimated impact of  adopting IFRS while ensuring comparable performance                                                                                                               | ROE 10% at ROE of 6% (from 5%) 100% at ROE of 16% (from 14%) 150% at ROE of 22% (from 20%)                                                                                                   |\n| VAI 2021 (awarded 2022):  2024 performance tranche                   | \u00b7  EVM previous business profit margin is substituted with   the adjusted IFRS underwriting development. \u00b7  Performance achievements will be disclosed upon vesting.                                                                                                                                 | Out of scope                                                                                                                                                                                 |",

For the 2023 performance tranche, this will be based on ROAE under US GAAP, which is the net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the average shareholders' equity adjusted for unrealised gains/losses as published in Swiss Re's audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe 2024 and 2025 performance tranches will be based on ROE under IFRS defined as Group net income divided by the average of the opening and closing reported\n\nshareholders' equity as published in Swiss Re's audited consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn both cases, the vesting between threshold, target and maximum is linear.\n\n## Measure: relative TSR\n\nThe second PSU performance condition is relative TSR measured over three years relative to the TSR of the pre-defined peer group for the same period. This peer group consists of companies that are similar in scale and have a global footprint or a similar business mix to Swiss Re. The peer group, which is set at the beginning of the plan period, includes Allianz SE, American International Group Inc, Aviva PLC, AXA SA, Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group Ltd, Hannover Rueck SE, MetLife Inc, Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-\n\nGesellschaft AG, Reinsurance Group of\n\nAmerica Inc, RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd, SCOR SE and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.\n\nVesting starts at the 35th percentile, 50% vests at the 50th percentile and the vesting is capped at 150% at the 90th percentile. For TSR values between the above-mentioned percentiles, the vesting percentage will be determined on a linear basis.\n\nPayout for a negative absolute TSR over the performance period is capped at 100%, subject to the Compensation Committee's right to assess the circumstances and decide on the performance multiple accordingly.\n\nThe 2023 LSP grant was based on a grant valuation share price of CHF 94.46 (average closing price of 30 trading days prior to the grant date, ie 20 February 202331 March 2023).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- * 2023 performance tranche is based on US GAAP Return on adjusted Equity and 2024-2025 performance tranches are based on IFRS Return on Equity.\n\n## 2024 outlook\n\nFor grants to be made as of 2024, the Board of Directors decided to continue measuring the LSP performance against two KPIs: IFRS ROE and relative TSR.",

For ROE PSUs and ENW PSUs, the performance is assessed at the end of each year over the three-year performance period and one third of the PSUs is locked in within a range of 0-150%. For rTSR PSUs the performance\n\nis only assessed once, at the end of the three-year period, with a vesting range of 0-150%. For the LSP 2021, the performance outcome for the ROE condition was below target during 2021 and 2022, and above the target during 2023, resulting in an average PSU performance factor of 70.3%. For the ENW condition, the target was met for the years 2021 and 2023, while the performance\n\nwas below target for the year 2022, resulting in an average performance of 73%. With respect to the rTSR condition, Swiss Re's position relative to peers was above the 50th percentile, resulting in a PSU performance factor of 57% for the three-year period of the LSP 2021. The combined performance factor was 64.9%.\n\n## LSP 2021: performance against targets\n\nAllocation\n\n| Measure       | Performance period                                                                                                                  | Performance measure                                                                                 |   value per  unit in CHF | Performance  tranche     | Target                                         | Result                       | Final   performance factor          |\n|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| ROE           | At the end of each year, the  performance is assessed and one  third of the ROE PSUs is locked in  within a range of 0% to 150% 1 . | 0% for an ROE at the   risk-free rate, up to 150%  for an ROE above the  risk-free rate plus 10.5%. |                    91.69 | 2021                     | 8.46% 10.00%                                   | 5.7% 2.6%                    | Average  performance  factor: 70.3% |\n| ENW           | At the end of each year, the  performance is assessed and one  third of the ENW PSUs is locked in  within a range of 0% to 150% 1 . | 0% for an ENW growth   at 0%, up to 150% for an  ENW growth at 15%.                                 |                    94.41 | 2022 2023                | 10.97% 10.0%                                   | 22.3% 10.6% -5.8% 11.3%      | Average  performance  factor: 73%   |\n| relative  TSR | Measured over three years.                                                                                                          | 50% vesting at the 50th  percentile and capped   at 150% vesting at the   75th percentile.          |                    50.81 | 2021 2022 2023 2021-2023 | 10.0% 10.0% TSR positioning  relative to peers | 53.2%   (57.5th  percentile) | 57%                                 |\n\nThe LSP 2021 grant was based on a grant valuation share price of CHF 89.90 (average closing price of 30 trading days prior to the grant date, ie 18 February 202131 March 2021).

The list of Key Risk Takers is reviewed on a regular basis by Group Risk Management and Human Resources.\n\n|                                                            | Performance year 2022 1, 2   | Performance year 2022 1, 2   | Performance year 2023 1, 2   | Performance year 2023 1, 2   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|\n| Category                                                   | Number of employees          | Values (in CHF millions)     | Number of employees          | Values (in CHF millions)     |\n| Base salaries 3                                            | 168                          | 60                           | 140                          | 49                           |\n| Pensions and benefits                                      | 168                          | 17                           | 140                          | 13                           |\n| Cash Annual Performance Incentive 4                        | 163                          | 30                           | 137                          | 36                           |\n| Deferred compensation awards                               |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| - Cash Deferral Plans 5                                    | 2                            | 0.2                          | 1                            | 0.1                          |\n| - Deferred Share Plan                                      | 105                          | 9                            | 127                          | 17                           |\n| Long-term variable compensation                            |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| - Granted in units subject to performance conditions 6     | 157                          | 18                           | 133                          | 16                           |\n| - Granted in units not subject to performance conditions 7 | 155                          | 13                           | 128                          | 14                           |\n| Other payments                                             |                              |                              |                              |                              |\n| - Severance payments 8                                     | 0                            | 0                            | 0                            | 0                            |\n| - Sign-on payments 9                                       | 14                           | 2                            | 6                            | 1                            |\n| Total 10                                                   |                              | 149                          |                              | 146                          |\n\n- 1 Disclosure excludes members of the Group EC who were in office during the reporting year.

The audit was limited to the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) in the tables marked 'audited' on pages 114 to 115, 117 to 118, 120, 123 and page 125 of the Compensation Report.\n\nIn our opinion, the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO in the accompanying Compensation Report complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of association.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the Compensation Report, the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Compensation Report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nP\n\n1\n\nf 57\n\n## KPMG AG\n\nBadenerstrasse 172 PO Box CH-8036 Zurich\n\n+41 58 249 31 31 kpmg.ch",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Compensation Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Compensation Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of association, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf8e7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf8e7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- \uf8e7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

Working through brokers and a network of offices around the globe, the Group serves a client base consisting of insurance companies, mid- to large-sized corporations and public-sector clients.\n\nSwiss Re Group consists of three core operating business segments: Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and comply with Swiss law. All significant intra-group transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Swiss Re Ltd has decided that as of 1 January 2024 the Group's consolidated financial statements will be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The impact of the adoption on the Group's financial statements is being assessed. Financial statements for periods ending on or prior to 31 December 2023 have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe Group's financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of Swiss Re Ltd and its subsidiaries. Voting entities which Swiss Re Ltd directly or indirectly controls through holding a majority of the voting rights are consolidated in the Group's accounts. Variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated when the Swiss Re Group is the primary beneficiary. The Group is the primary beneficiary when it has power over the activities that impact the VIE's economic performance and at the same time has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nCompanies which the Group does not control, but over which it directly or indirectly exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method or the fair value option and are included in other invested assets. The Swiss Re Group's share of net profit or loss in investments accounted for under the equity method is included in net investment income. Equity and net income of these companies are adjusted as necessary to be in line with the Group's accounting policies. The results of consolidated subsidiaries and investments accounted for using the equity method are included in the financial statements for the period commencing from the date of acquisition.\n\n## Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the related disclosure, including contingent assets and liabilities. The Swiss Re Group's liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and policy benefits for life and health include estimates for premium, claim and benefit data not received from ceding companies at the date of the financial statements. In addition, the Group uses certain financial instruments and invests in securities of certain entities for which exchange trading does not exist. The Group determines these estimates based on historical information, actuarial analyses, financial modelling and other analytical techniques. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates described above.\n\n## Foreign currency remeasurement and translation\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to the respective subsidiary's functional currency at average exchange rates. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at closing exchange rates, whereas non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at historical rates.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities and trading securities are reported in earnings. Remeasurement gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, investments in consolidated subsidiaries and investments accounted for using the equity method are reported in shareholders' equity.",

        "page_content": "For consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars are translated from the functional currency to US dollars at closing rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reported in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets\n\nThe fair value of the majority of the Group's financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets or observable inputs. These instruments include government and agency securities, commercial paper, most investment-grade corporate debt, most high-yield debt securities, exchange-traded derivative instruments, most mortgage- and asset-backed securities and listed equity securities. In markets with reduced or no liquidity, spreads between bid and offer prices are normally wider compared to spreads in highly liquid markets. Such market conditions affect the valuation of certain asset classes of the Group, such as some asset-backed securities as well as certain derivative structures referencing such asset classes.\n\nThe Group considers both the credit risk of its counterparties and own risk of non-performance in the valuation of derivative instruments and other over-the-counter financial assets. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the assessment of the Group's exposure to the credit risk of its counterparties incorporates consideration of existing collateral and netting arrangements entered into with each counterparty. The measure of the counterparty credit risk is estimated by incorporating the observable credit spreads, where available, or credit spread estimates derived based on the benchmarking techniques where market data is not available. The impact of the Group's own risk of non-performance is analysed in a manner consistent with the aforementioned approach, with consideration given to the Group's observable credit spreads. The value representing such risk is incorporated into the fair value of the financial instruments (primarily derivatives), in a liability position as of the measurement date. The change in this adjustment from period to period is reflected in realised investment gains and losses in the income statement.\n\nFor assets or derivative structures at fair value, the Group uses market prices or inputs derived from market prices. A separate internal price verification process, independent of the trading function, provides an additional control over the market prices or market inputs used to determine the fair values of such assets. Although management considers that appropriate values have been ascribed to such assets, there is always a level of uncertainty and judgement related to these valuations. Subsequent valuations could differ significantly from the results of the process described above. The Group may become aware of counterparty valuations, either directly through the exchange of information or indirectly, for example through collateral demands. Any implied differences are considered in the independent price verification process and may result in adjustments to initially indicated valuations. As of 31 December 2023, the Group had not provided any collateral on financial instruments in excess of its own market value estimates.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Group's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) or trading.\n\nFixed income securities AFS are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the difference between the applicable measure of cost and fair value being recognised in shareholders' equity and subject to impairment. For fixed income securities AFS for which the fair value is below amortised cost and there is no intention or obligation to sell, the impairment loss is split into (i) the estimated amount relating to credit losses, and (ii) the amount relating to non-credit factors. The estimated credit loss is recognised as an allowance in earnings as a component of net realised investment gains/losses, with the remainder of the loss recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance for credit losses is measured as the amount by which the amortised cost basis exceeds the best estimate of the present value of cash flows expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses and the corresponding charge to earnings can be reversed as conditions change. However, the amount to be reversed is limited to the initial credit loss allowance recognised. When there is an intention or obligation to sell and the fair value is lower than amortised cost, the amortised cost of the respective security is written down to its current fair value. Subsequent recoveries are recognised in earnings as a component of net realised investment gains/losses.\n\nTrading fixed income securities are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings. A trading classification is used for securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term.\n\nEquity investments are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings, with the exception of equity method investments and investments that result in consolidation.\n\nInterest on fixed income securities is recorded in net investment income when earned and is adjusted for the amortisation of any purchase premium or discount. Dividends on equity securities are recognised as investment income on the ex-dividend date. Realised gains and losses on sales are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method.\n\nPolicy loans, mortgages and other loans are carried at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised in accordance with the effective yield method. The allowance for credit losses on mortgage and other loans are estimated on an expected loss basis using a model that utilises probability of default and loss given default methods over the contractual lifetime of the instrument. The allowance is recognised in earnings as a component of net realised investment gains/losses. The allowance for credit losses and the corresponding charge to earnings can be reversed as conditions change and are recognised as adjustments to the allowance for credit losses. When all or a portion of a loan is deemed uncollectible, the uncollectible portion of the carrying amount of the loan is written- off against the allowance.\n\nInvestment in real estate that the Group intends to hold in order to earn income is carried at depreciated cost, net of any write-downs for impairment in value. Depreciation on buildings is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Land is",

        "page_content": "recognised at cost and not depreciated. Impairment in value is recognised if the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the real estate is lower than its carrying value. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recognised in realised investment losses. Depreciation and other related charges or credits are included in net investment income. Investment in real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated selling costs, and is not depreciated. Reductions in the carrying value of real estate held for sale are included in realised investment losses.\n\nShort-term investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in earnings. The Group considers highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of one year or less, but greater than three months, to be short-term investments.\n\nOther invested assets include equity accounted companies, derivative financial instruments, collateral receivables, securities purchased under agreement to resell, deposits and time deposits, and investments without readily determinable fair value (including limited partnership investments). Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest equals or exceeds 3% are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest is below 3% and equity investments in corporate entities which are not publicly traded are accounted for at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognised in earnings.\n\nThe Group enters into securities lending arrangements under which it loans certain securities in exchange for collateral and receives securities lending fees. The Group's policy is to require collateral, consisting of cash or securities, equal to at least 102% of the carrying value of the securities loaned. In certain arrangements, the Group may accept collateral of less than 102% if the structure of the overall transaction offers an equivalent level of security. Cash received as collateral is recognised along with an obligation to return the cash. Securities received as collateral that can be sold or repledged are also recognised along with an obligation to return those securities. Securities lending fees are recognised over the term of the related loans.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, options, forwards and exchange-traded financial futures for the Group's trading and hedging strategy in line with the overall risk management strategy. Derivative financial instruments are primarily used as a means of managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purchases, existing assets or existing liabilities and also to lock in attractive investment conditions for funds which become available in the future. The Group recognises all of its derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value on derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in income.\n\nIf the derivative is designated as a hedge of the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If the derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular risk, changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognised in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in earnings. When hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge, the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the formerly hedged transaction is reported in earnings. When the Group discontinues  cash flow hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within the required time period, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value, and gains and losses that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognised in earnings.\n\nThe Group recognises separately derivatives that are embedded within other host instruments if the economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and if it meets the definition of a derivative if it were a free-standing contract.\n\nDerivative financial instrument assets are generally included in other invested assets and derivative financial instrument liabilities are generally included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\n\nThe Group also designates non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain foreign operations. From the inception of the hedging relationship, remeasurement gains and losses on the designated non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments and translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment are reported as translation gains and losses in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term deposits, certain short-term investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs\n\nThe Group incurs costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal reinsurance and insurance business. Some of these costs, which consist primarily of commissions, are deferred as they are directly related to the successful acquisition of such business.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs for short-duration contracts are amortised in proportion to premiums earned. Deferred acquisition costs for traditional long-duration contracts are amortised over the life of underlying contracts based upon the present value of gross premiums.",

        "page_content": "Deferred acquisition costs for universal-life type contracts and similar products are amortised based on the present value of estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are updated quarterly.\n\n## Modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially unchanged contract as a continuation of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits (PVFP) will continue to be amortised. The Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially changed contract as an extinguishment of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs or PVFP are written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe underlying assets and liabilities acquired are subsequently accounted for according to the relevant US GAAP guidance. This includes specific requirements applicable to subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities recognised as part of the acquisition method of accounting, including present value of future profits, goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Acquired present value of future profits\n\nThe acquired present value of future profits (PVFP) of business in force is recorded in connection with the acquisition of life and health business. The initial value is calculated as the difference between established reserves, which are set up in line with US GAAP accounting policies and assumptions of the Group, and their fair value at the acquisition date. The resulting PVFP, which could be positive or negative, is amortised on a constant yield basis over the expected revenue recognition period of the business acquired, generally over periods ranging up to 30 years, with the accrual of interest added to the unamortised balance at the earned rate. Amortisation and accrual of interest are recognised in acquisition costs. The earned rate corresponds to either the current earned rate or the original earned rate depending on the business written. The rate is consistently applied for the entire life of the applicable business. For universal-life and similar products, PVFP is amortised in line with estimated gross profits, which are updated quarterly. The carrying value of PVFP is reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. Adjustments to PVFP reflecting impairment in value are recognised in acquisition costs during the period in which the determination of impairment is made, or in other comprehensive income for shadow loss recognition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of 30 September, unless there is an event or circumstances which makes an impairment more likely than not. Adjustments to reflect impairment in value are recognised in earnings in the period in which the determination of impairment is made.\n\n## Other assets\n\nOther assets include deferred expenses on retroactive reinsurance, prepaid reinsurance premiums, receivables related to investing activities, real estate for own use, other classes of property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use asset, accrued income, certain intangible assets and prepaid assets.\n\nThe excess of estimated liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses payable over consideration received in respect of retroactive property and casualty reinsurance contracts is recorded as a deferred expense. The deferred expense on retroactive reinsurance contracts is amortised through earnings over the expected claims-paying period.\n\nReal estate for own use as well as other classes of property, plant and equipment are carried at depreciated cost. Depreciation on buildings is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Land is recognised at cost and not depreciated.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group recognises for finance and operating leases a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease right-of-use asset is included in 'other assets' and the lease liability is included in 'accrued expenses and other liabilities' on the balance sheet. Lease expense for lease payments is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAdditional disclosures are provided in Note 12 'Leases'.\n\n## Capitalised software costs\n\nExternal direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop or obtain software for internal use, payroll and payroll-related costs for employees directly associated with software development and interest cost incurred while developing software for internal use are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis through earnings over the estimated useful life.",

        "page_content": "## Income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised based on the difference between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realised.\n\nThe Group recognises the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgement occurs. Interest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense.\n\nThe Group releases stranded tax effects for unrealised gains/losses on AFS securities to earnings on a straight-line basis over the average duration of the relevant AFS portfolio as an approximation of when the individual securities within the portfolio are sold or mature. For adjustment for pension and other post-retirement benefits, stranded tax effects are released to earnings when the relevant pension plan is terminated. For foreign currency translation, stranded tax effects are released to earnings in line with the recycling of the underlying foreign currency translation amounts.\n\n## Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for property and casualty and for life and health insurance and reinsurance contracts are accrued when insured events occur and are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling the claims, using reports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies. Reserves also are established for claims incurred but not reported, which are developed on the basis of past experience adjusted for current trends and other factors that modify past experience. The establishment of the appropriate level of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and judgements made by management, and therefore there can be no assurance that ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses will not exceed the loss reserves currently established by the Group. These estimates are regularly reviewed, and adjustments for differences between estimates and actual payments for claims and for changes in estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are made.\n\nThe Group does not discount liabilities arising from prospective property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, including liabilities which are discounted for US statutory reporting purposes. Liabilities arising from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting.\n\nThe Group does not discount life and health claim reserves except for disability income claims in payment and mortality claims paid out in the form of an annuity. These claims are recognised at the estimated present value of the remaining ultimate net costs of the incurred claims.\n\nExperience features which are directly linked to a reinsurance asset or liability are classified in a manner that is consistent with the presentation of that asset or liability.\n\n## Liabilities for life and health policy benefits\n\nLiabilities for life and health policy benefits from reinsurance business are generally calculated using the net level premium method, based on assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals, lapses and policyholder dividends. Assumptions are set at the time the contract is issued or, in the case of contracts acquired by purchase, at the acquisition date. The assumptions are based on current best estimates, making allowance for possible adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions for life and health (re)insurance benefit liabilities are based on estimates of expected investment yields. Assumed mortality or morbidity rates are generally based on experience multiples applied to the actuarial select and ultimate tables based on industry experience.\n\n## Policyholder account balances\n\nPolicyholder account balances relate to universal-life-type contracts and investment contracts.\n\nUniversal-life-type contracts are long-duration insurance contracts, providing either death or annuity benefits, with terms that are not fixed and guaranteed.\n\nInvestment contracts are long-duration contracts that do not incorporate significant insurance risk, ie there is no mortality and morbidity risk, or the mortality and morbidity risk associated with the insurance benefit features offered in the contract is of insignificant amount or remote probability. Amounts received as payment for investment contracts are reported as policyholder account balances. Related assets are included in general account assets except for investments for unit-linked, which are presented in a separate line item on the face of the balance sheet.\n\nAmounts assessed against policyholders for mortality, administration and surrender are reported as fee income. Amounts credited to policyholders are reported as interest credited to policyholders. Investment income and realised investment gains and losses allocable to policyholders are included in net investment income and net realised investment gains/losses except for unit-linked, which is presented in a separate line item on the face of the income statement.\n\nIn unit-linked contracts, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 7 'Investments'.",

        "page_content": "## Funds held assets and liabilities\n\nOn the asset side, funds held by ceding companies consist mainly of amounts retained by the ceding company for business written on a funds withheld basis. In addition, the account also includes amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting to ceded retrocession or reinsurance contracts.\n\nOn the liability side, funds held under reinsurance treaties consist mainly of amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting to inward insurance and reinsurance contracts. In addition, the account also includes amounts retained from ceded business written on a funds withheld basis.\n\nFunds withheld assets are assets that would normally be paid to the Group but are withheld by the cedent to reduce a potential credit risk or to retain control over investments. In case of funds withheld liabilities, it is the Group that withholds assets related to ceded business in order to reduce its credit risk or retain control over the investments.\n\nThe deposit method of accounting is applied to insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not indemnify the ceding company or the Group against loss or liability relating to insurance risk. Under the deposit method of accounting, the deposit asset or liability is initially measured based on the consideration paid or received. For contracts that transfer neither significant timing nor underwriting risk, and contracts that transfer only significant timing risk, changes in estimates of the timing or amounts of cash flows are accounted for by recalculating the effective yield. The deposit is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the contract. The revenue and expense recorded for such contracts is included in net investment income. For contracts that transfer only significant underwriting risk, once a loss is incurred, the deposit is adjusted by the present value of the incurred loss. At each subsequent balance sheet date, the portion of the deposit attributable to the incurred loss is recalculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows. The resulting changes in the carrying amount of the deposit are recognised in claims and claim adjustment expenses.\n\nFunds withheld balances are presented together with assets and liabilities arising from the application of the deposit method because of their common deposit-type character.\n\n## Premium deficiency testing\n\nThe level of the premium deficiency test is at the segment level or separate business within Group Items. The testing is performed net of external retrocessions.\n\nFor long duration contracts, liabilities for life and health policy benefits are increased with a charge to earnings if there is a premium deficiency. A premium deficiency exists if the liability for future policy benefits calculated using best estimate cash flows, including investment income, is higher than the net GAAP liability. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferred acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition costs, then an additional liability will be established for the difference. In connection with the premium deficiency testing, an analysis is performed to determine that profits will not be followed by losses. The best estimate cash flows by year along with the change in the locked in GAAP reserve are reviewed to determine that there are not any profits followed by losses. If so, an additional GAAP reserve is established by calculating the portion of future premiums required to be used as an additional reserve to offset the future losses.\n\nFor short duration contracts, a premium deficiency exists when the unearned premium plus expected investment income is less than the total of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, related estimated policy maintenance costs (incl. unallocated loss adjustment expenses), related unamortised acquisition costs and expected dividends to policyholders. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferred acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition cost, then a liability will be established for the difference.\n\n## Shadow adjustments\n\nShadow adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income reflecting the offset of adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and PVFP, typically related to universal-life-type contracts, and policyholder liabilities. The purpose is to reflect the fact that certain amounts recorded as unrealised investment gains and losses within shareholders' equity will ultimately accrue to policyholders and not shareholders.\n\nShadow loss recognition testing becomes relevant in low interest rate environments. The test considers whether the hypothetical sale of AFS securities and the reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields would lead to negative operational earnings in future periods, thereby causing a loss recognition event. For shadow loss recognition testing, the Group uses current market yields to determine best estimate US GAAP reserves rather than using locked-in or current book yields. If the unlocked best estimate US GAAP reserves based on current market rates are in excess of reserves based on locked-in or current book yields, a shadow loss recognition reserve is set up. These reserves are recognised in other comprehensive income and do not impact net income. In addition, shadow loss recognition reserves can reverse up to the amount of losses recognised due to past loss events.\n\n## Premiums\n\nProperty and casualty reinsurance premiums are recorded when written and include an estimate for written premiums receivable at period end. Premiums earned are generally recognised in income over the contract period in proportion to the amount of reinsurance provided. Unearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided. Life reinsurance premiums are earned when due. Related policy benefits are recorded in relation to the associated premium or gross profits so that profits are recognised over the expected lives of the contracts.",

        "page_content": "Life and health reinsurance premiums for group coverages are generally earned over the term of the coverage. For group contracts that allow experience adjustments to premiums, such premiums are recognised as the related experience emerges.\n\nReinstatement premiums are due where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. The recognition of reinstatement premiums as written depends on individual contract features. Reinstatement premiums are either recognised as written at the time a loss event occurs or in line with the recognition pattern of premiums written of the underlying contract. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on actuarial estimates of ultimate losses. Reinstatement premiums are generally earned in proportion to the amount of reinsurance provided.\n\n## Insurance and reinsurance ceded\n\nThe Group uses retrocession arrangements to increase its aggregate underwriting capacity, to diversify its risk and to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss on reinsurance assumed. The ceding of risks to retrocessionaires does not relieve the Group of its obligations to its ceding companies. The Group regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and monitors the concentration of credit risk to minimise its exposure to financial loss from retrocessionaires' insolvency. Premiums and losses ceded under retrocession contracts are reported as reductions of premiums earned and claims and claim adjustment expenses. Amounts recoverable for ceded short- and longduration contracts, including universal-life-type and investment contracts, are reported as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Group provides reserves for uncollectible amounts on reinsurance balances ceded, based on management's assessment of the expected collectability of the outstanding balances.\n\n## Receivables\n\nPremium and claims receivables which have been invoiced are accounted for at face value. Together with assets arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting that meet the definition of financing receivables they are regularly assessed for impairment. Evidence of impairment is the age of the receivable and/or any financial difficulties of the counterparty. Allowances are set up on the net balance, meaning all balances related to the same counterparty are considered. The amount of the allowance is principally set up based on an analysis of the credit quality of the debtor and can be as high as the outstanding net balance.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs using the accrual method of accounting. Amounts charged to expense are based on periodic actuarial determinations.\n\n## Share-based payment transactions\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had a Leadership Performance Plan (LPP)/Leadership Share Plan (LSP), a Deferred Share Plan (DSP), restricted shares and a Global Share Participation Plan. These plans are described in more detail in Note 16 'Share-based payments'. The Group accounts for share-based payment transactions with employees using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, the fair value of the awards is recognised in earnings over the vesting period.\n\nFor share-based compensation plans which are settled in cash, compensation costs are recognised as liabilities, whereas for equity-settled plans, compensation costs are recognised as an accrual to additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are reported at cost in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Earnings per common share\n\nBasic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares entitled to dividends during the year. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the effect on earnings and average common shares outstanding associated with dilutive securities.\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 12 March 2024. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.\n\n## Adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASC 326, 'Financial Instruments - Credit Losses', which replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects current expected credit losses (CECL). The standard is applicable to all assets such as financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost, fixed income securities available-for-sale, premium receivables, funds withheld assets and reinsurance recoverable. The objective of the expected credit loss model is that a reporting entity recognises its estimate of expected credit losses incorporating forward-looking information in a valuation allowance for assets in scope. The Group adopted the standard on 1 January 2023 using a modified retrospective method. As of 1 January 2023, the impact of the adoption of the standard was a reduction in opening retained earnings of USD 95 million (net of tax). The Group also adopted the required disclosures within Note 3 'Insurance information' and Note 7 'Investments'. Results for reporting periods prior to 1 January 2023 are presented in accordance with the previous guidance.",

        "page_content": "In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, 'Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment', an update to Topic 350, 'Intangibles Goodwill and Other'. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity has to perform procedures to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognised assets and liabilities) at the impairment testing date following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its regular goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognise an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss recognised should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. As amended by ASU 2019-10 'Effective Dates', ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. The Group adopted the standard on 1 January 2023. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, 'Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers', an update to Topic 805, 'Business Combinations'. Prior to the update, Topic 805 required all assets acquired and all liabilities assumed in a business combination to be recognized on the basis of the fair value as of the acquisition date. The amendments in ASU 2021-08 outline that contract assets and contract liabilities with a respective deferred revenue and deferred expense component acquired in a business combination should be recognized in accordance with ASC 606 'Revenue from Contracts with Customers' assuming the contractual terms as if the acquirer entered into the original contract on the same date with the same conditions when determining the recognition value. ASU 2021-08 is effective prospectively in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. The Group adopted ASU 2021-08 as of 1 January 2023.\n\nIn March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-01, 'Fair Value Hedging - Portfolio Layer Method', an update to Topic 815, 'Derivatives and Hedging'. This ASU amends ASU 2017-12 issued in August 2017 to further simplify fair value hedge accounting. ASU 2017-12 established the 'last-of-layer' method to enable the application of fair value hedging to a stated amount of closed portfolios of prepayable financial assets or one or more beneficial interests secured by a portfolio of prepayable financial instruments. The amendments in this update expand the scope of fair value hedge accounting permitting the application of the  'portfolio-layer' method  to portfolios of all financial assets, including both prepayable and non-prepayable financial assets. ASU 2022-01 is effective prospectively in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. The Group adopted ASU 2022-01 as of 1 January 2023.\n\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, 'Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations', an update to Topic 405 'Liabilities- Supplier Finance Programs'. This ASU applies to all entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services and require that a buyer in a supplier finance program discloses sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. ASU 2022-04 is effective retrospectively in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2023. The Group adopted ASU 2022-04 as of 1 January 2023 for the requirements that have become effective as of this date. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, 'Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have undertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying US GAAP accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of these reference rate reform initiatives. The Group adopted ASU 2020-04 on 12 March 2020, which is the issuance date of the standard. There is a choice to apply the guidance by Topic or industry Subtopic at any time prospectively during the effective period from 12 March 2020 through 31 December 2024, with the effective period amended by ASU 2022-06 'Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. As of 31 December 2023, the Group applied the guidance to Topic 815 related to derivative contracts that were amended for LIBOR references due to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (the 'LIBOR Act') which applies to US contracts that lack sufficient contractual provisions addressing the permanent cessation of LIBOR as well as to Topic 944 related to changes resulting from the replacement of discontinued reference rates included in contracts within the scope of Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'. The Group also applied the guidance to modifications of loan contracts within the scope of Topic 310 'Receivables' due to replacements of reference rates that are expected to be discontinued. These modifications are being accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate.\n\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, 'Scope', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. Because of the broad population of derivatives affected by the market-wide transition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the 'discounting transition'), stakeholders analysed the accounting implications of the discounting transition against the available exceptions and expedients within Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform', which led them to raise questions about the scope of that Topic. The amendments clarify the scope of Topic 848 and allow entities to apply certain optional provisions in Topic 848 to derivative instruments that undergo a modification of the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment because of the discounting transition that do not also reference LIBOR or another reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. The Group applied ASU 2021-01 as of 31 December 2023.\n\nAlthough the Group has exposure to discontinued IBORs, the transition to the new risk-free reference rates did not have a material impact, mostly due to the transition relief measures in Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'.",

        "page_content": "## Future adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, 'Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts', an update to Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'. This ASU requires that the cash flows and net premium ratio will be updated for changes in insurance assumptions (eg mortality, morbidity, terminations) when measuring the liability for future policy benefits for nonparticipating traditional and limited-payment insurance and reinsurance contracts. There will no longer be a provision for adverse deviation. In addition, the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the liability for future policy benefits will be standardised. Further, the ASU requires deferred acquisition costs (DAC) relating to most long-duration contracts to be amortised on a constant basis over the expected term of the contract. As amended by ASU 2020-11 'Effective Date and Early Application', ASU 2018-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2024, and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2025. Due to the decision of the Board of Directors of SRZ to prepare the Group's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS beginning 1 January 2024, the Group does not plan to adopt ASU 2018-12.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Information on business segments\n\nThe Group provides reinsurance and insurance throughout the world through its business segments. The business segments are determined by the organisational structure and by the way in which management reviews the operating performance of the Group.\n\nThe Group presents three core operating business segments: Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions. Interest expense is based on the segment's capital funding position. The tax impact of a segment is derived from the legal entity tax obligations and the segmentation of the pre-tax result. While most of the tax items can be directly attributed to individual segments, the tax within an entity which impacts two or more segments is allocated to the segments based on the applicable statutory tax rate on pre-tax income or loss with permanent tax differences specifically allocated to the applicable segments. Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance share the same year-to-date effective tax rate.\n\nAccounting policies applied by the business segments are in line with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (please refer to Note 1). Cross-segmental dividends and gains and losses on certain one-off transfers and transactions between segments are accounted for through segmental shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Group operating segments are outlined below.\n\nThe reinsurance business is managed through two operating segments, Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance, operating globally, both through brokers and directly with clients, and providing a large range of solutions for risk and capital management. Clients include stock and mutual insurance companies as well as public sector and governmental entities. In addition to traditional reinsurance solutions, both Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance offer insurance-linked securities and other insurance-related capital market products.\n\nThe Business Unit Global Clients and Solutions, that comprises Public Sector Solutions, Reinsurance Solutions, and iptiQ, is reported across different operating segments.\n\n## Property & Casualty Reinsurance\n\nProperty & Casualty includes the business lines property, casualty (including motor) and specialty.\n\n## Life & Health Reinsurance\n\nLife & Health includes the life and health lines of business.\n\n## Corporate Solutions\n\nCorporate Solutions offers innovative insurance capacity to mid- to large-sized corporations across the globe. Offerings range from standard risk transfer covers and multi-line programmes to highly customised solutions tailored to the needs of clients. Corporate Solutions serves customers from offices worldwide.\n\n## Group items\n\niptiQ results are reported within the Group items segment. Group items also includes items not allocated to the core operating business segments, which encompass parts of Principal Investments, Swiss Re Ltd, the Group's ultimate parent company, certain Treasury units and reinsurance and insurance business in run-off. iptiQ partners with distributors providing the Swiss Re Group access to risk pools offering white labelled protection cover in both the life and health as well as property and casualty businesses. Swiss Re Ltd charges trademark licence fees to the business segments which are reported as other revenues. Certain administrative expenses of the corporate centre functions that are not recharged to the operating segments are reported under Group items.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nSegment information is presented net of external and internal retrocession and other intra-group arrangements. The Group total is obtained after elimination of intra-group transactions in the 'Consolidation' column. This includes significant intra-group reinsurance arrangements, recharge of trademark licence fees and intersegmental funding.",

The evaluation of the allowance includes several judgements including a default analysis to estimate uncollectible balances based on balances by cedent, net of collateral and netting, and default factors used to estimate the forward-looking allowance. Default factors are determined using principally the current financial strength rating of each cedent, asset class, seniority and geography. Changes in the allowance for premiums and other receivables are recorded in 'Operating expenses' in the income statement. Changes in the allowance for reinsurance recoverable are recorded in 'Claims and claim adjustment expenses' and 'Life and health benefits' in the income statement.",

        "page_content": "## Prior-year development\n\nNon-life claims development on prior years in the year ended 31 December 2023 is due to adverse development in casualty, partly offset by favourable development from property and specialty. The adverse movement in casualty is due to adverse experience and assumption strengthening in liability and motor. Development in property is principally due to releases for large losses and lower-than-expected claims activity in all regions. Specialty was mainly impacted by favourable development in credit and surety, partly offset by engineering and aviation.\n\nFor life and health lines of business, development on prior years' unpaid claims in the year ended 31 December 2023 is unfavourable. There is unfavourable development from adverse claims experience in the US, partially offset by favourable claims development in the UK. Claims development related to prior years for disability portfolio also includes an element of interest accretion for unpaid claims reported at an estimated present value.\n\nA summary of prior-year net claims and claim adjustment expenses development by lines of business for the years ended 31 December is shown below 1 :\n\n| USD millions      | 2022   | 2023   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Line of business: |        |        |\n| Property          | -468   | -1 789 |\n| Casualty          | 810    | 2 350  |\n| Specialty         | -13    | -23    |\n| Life and health   | 346    | 271    |\n| Total             | 675    | 809    |\n\n## US asbestos and environmental claims exposure\n\nThe Group's obligation for claims payments and claims settlement charges also includes obligations for long-latent injury claims arising out of policies written prior to 1986, in particular in the area of US asbestos and environmental liability.\n\nAt the end of 2023, the Group carried net reserves for US asbestos and environmental liabilities equal to USD 1 175 million. During 2023, the Group incurred net gains of USD 16 million and net paid losses of USD 125 million in relation to these liabilities. These amounts include unallocated loss adjustment expenses.\n\nEstimating ultimate asbestos and environmental liabilities is particularly complex for a number of reasons relating in part to the long period between exposure and manifestation of claims, and in part to other factors, which include risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, changes in projected costs to resolve, and in the projected number of, asbestos and environmental claims, the effect of bankruptcy protection, insolvencies, and changes in the legal, legislative and regulatory environment. As a result, the Group believes that projection of exposures for asbestos and environmental claims is subject to far less predictability relative to non-environmental and non-asbestos exposures. Management believes that its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts and the current state of the law. However, reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. Additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of reserves, and the Group's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. Any such additional liabilities or increases in estimates cannot be reasonably estimated in advance but could result in charges that could be material to operating results.",

Additional aggregation or disaggregation is provided where appropriate, necessary and practicable ('disaggregation categories'). For instance, Reinsurance liability and motor lines of business are further disaggregated into proportional and non-proportional treaty types to provide more specific information on claims development. Amounts shown in the claims development tables are on a nominal basis, including cases where the Group discounts claims liabilities for measurement under US GAAP, and are net of external retrocession and retrocession between business segments to the extent that a retrocession programme can be allocated to a disaggregation category. Ceded retroactive reinsurance is not included in the claims development table if it cannot be allocated on a reasonable basis to the disaggregation categories used to present claims development information. Loss portfolio transfers are presented prospectively as reliable historical claims information is not always obtainable, or the data is incomplete and of insufficient quality.\n\nIn the Property & Casualty Reinsurance segment as well as for the non-life business in the Corporate Solutions segment, all contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are included in scope to the extent they can be allocated to a disaggregation category. For many reinsurance contracts, proportional contracts in particular, ceding companies do not report losses by accident year. In these cases, the Group has allocated reported losses by underwriting year to accident year to produce the accident year tables. Similarly, IBNR is calculated on an underwriting year basis and then the liabilities are allocated to accident year.\n\nLife & Health contracts that are not expected to remain in force for an extended period are classified as short duration contracts. These provide insurance protection for a fixed short duration and their provisions may be subject to changes at the end of contract period, such as adjustments to the premium charged or the coverage provided. Examples of short duration contracts in the Life & Health Reinsurance segment include group life business, certain types of disability and long-term care contracts, group accident, and health coverage including critical illness and medical expenses. The Group provides claims development information for Life & Health Reinsurance where reported accident year information is available and there is potential for claims development. This primarily applies to the group disability business in Australia, Continental Europe and the UK. This business is generally considered to have relatively higher claims estimation uncertainty than other life and health lines such as group life, due to longer claims development periods.\n\nThe Group provides no claims development information for the Group items segment as its short duration reserves are not material.\n\nFor Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions, the Group discloses data for ten accident years and reporting periods.\n\nThe Corporate Solutions business segment was created in 2012. Corporate Solutions related business written in Property & Casualty Reinsurance prior to 2012 is included in the net claims development information reported by this segment. All but an immaterial portion of claims arising from accident years prior to 2012 relate to accident years which are over ten years ago and therefore out of the required range of disclosure.\n\nThe current reporting period estimate of net claims liabilities for accident years older than the number of years shown in the claims development tables is presented as a total after disclosure of cumulative paid claims.\n\nThe information presented in claims development tables is presented at current balance sheet foreign exchange rates as of the date of these financial statements to permit an analysis of claims development excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements.\n\nSome of the information provided in the following tables is Required Supplementary Information (RSI) under US GAAP and does not form part of these consolidated audited financial statements. Claims development information for all periods except the current reporting period and any information derived from it - including average annual percentage payout of claims incurred - is considered RSI and is identified as RSI in the tables presented.",

        "page_content": "## Methodology for determining the presented amounts of liabilities for unpaid claims\n\nThe liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is based on an estimate of the ultimate cost of settling the claims based on both information reported to us by ceding companies and internal estimates.\n\n## Non-life re/insurance contracts\n\nThe Group develops and recognises its own estimate of IBNR claims, which includes circumstances in which cedents have not reported any claims to the Group or where the Group's estimate of reserves needed to cover reported claims differs from the amounts reported by cedent. For reinsurance business, case reserves and estimated IBNR are reported by cedent and this IBNR is presented together with the Group's own estimate as IBNR in the claims development tables. For insurance business, reserving is performed similarly, except that estimates for case reserves and IBNR are performed by the Group.\n\nReserving is done on portfolio or contract level depending on the features of the contract. For business reviewed on a portfolio level, the expected ultimate losses are set for most lines and types of business based on analysis performed using standard actuarial techniques. In general, contracts are aggregated into portfolios by combining contracts with similar features, and ultimate losses are derived using a blend of initial costing loss ratio and actual reported experience, with more weighting given to experience over time.\n\nThe initial reserving estimate uses a loss ratio projection method, where the projected loss ratio is generally the costing loss ratio, reflecting the underwriter's view of the risk. In the case of new information regarding loss trends, rate changes or a different underwriter's estimate, the projected loss ratio can be adjusted if approved by the Business Unit Reserving Committee. As experience develops, the most common standard reserving methods used are successively the Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Benktander and Chain Ladder methods. The BornhuetterFerguson method assumes that the future claims experience is in line with the one anticipated by the costing loss ratio, used as an a priori loss ratio, and not based on claims experience. The Benktander method is a weighted average of the Bornhuetter-Ferguson and Chain Ladder methods, where the weighted average is linked to the reported development pattern. In other terms, this method mainly follows the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in the early stages and the Chain Ladder later on, progressively giving more weight to the experience. The Chain Ladder method assumes past trends will be repeated and extrapolates the current position to ultimate using historical development trends.\n\nIn most cases, these standard actuarial techniques encompass a number of loss development factor techniques applied to claim tables of paid and reported losses. Other actuarial techniques may be applicable to specific categories, such as an analysis of frequency and severity. Life contingency techniques for projecting regular payments related to bodily injury claims are applied to motor proportional, motor nonproportional, liability proportional, liability non-proportional, accident and health, where the information is available. In some cases, techniques specific to the projection of future payments for specific risks such as asbestos or pollution claims are applied to both proportional and non-proportional liability claims, also in Corporate Solutions (see also separate section 'US asbestos and environmental claims exposure' on page 175). Reserving for non-traditional business is carried out on a deal-by-deal basis according to each deal's specifications. For large events, a separate process takes into consideration the relevant expertise from underwriting and claims functions in estimating the ultimate loss.\n\nContract-level reserving is based on standard actuarial techniques but requires more detailed contract, pricing, claim and exposure information than required for the business reviewed on a portfolio level.\n\n## Life and health re/insurance contracts\n\nFor the Life & Health business, liability for unpaid claims includes case reserves, IBNR, and provisions for disability income claims-inpayment. Estimates for case reserves allow for expected rates of decline for the not yet settled claims. IBNR claim reserves are calculated using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson approaches, and assumptions as to the claims reporting patterns, initial expected ultimate claims, and weighting given to historical experience. Liability for disability income claims-in-payment is determined by calculating expected future claim payments using the assumed rate of termination of claims due to death or recovery.\n\n## Claims frequency information\n\nClaims frequency information is not available for the disaggregation categories of Property & Casualty Reinsurance, as cedents do not report claims frequency information to the Group for most of the assumed reinsurance contract types.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance reports claims frequency information based on individual incidence. The number of reported claims is the actual number of claims booked. For disability business, claims with multiple payments in a year are counted as one claim. Claims that are reported but not recognised are included in the claim count. Claims frequency information is not available for the group disability business in Continental Europe as reliable historical claims frequency information is not obtainable.\n\nFor Corporate Solutions, claims frequency is displayed for direct business only, as individual claims information is generally not available for assumed and ceded business. Claims are counted individually per contract to produce the claims frequency table. For some direct business, summary reports are received, and multiple claims are booked under a single claim code; this is usually done at a programme, policy year, state, country and/or line of business level of detail. This approach may be applied to business which has a high volume of claim counts, but with only minor claims dollars associated with each claim.",

For details on consolidation please refer to Note 2 ''Information on business segments''.\n\nThe net outstanding liabilities correspond to the total liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of reinsurance for each disaggregation category.\n\nOther short duration contract lines include reserves for business that is not material to the Group and where accident year information is not available. For Life & Health Reinsurance, in certain markets, cedents do not provide sufficient information to reinsurers to split claims incurred and claims paid by accident year. This is based on existing market practice. For these markets, an assessment of available information from other sources was made along with investigating approximations that could be used to provide claims development information by accident year. However, these alternate sources and estimates, based on currently available data and methods, could not be used to generate meaningful and representative accident year information and therefore have been excluded from disclosure. Other short duration contract lines also contain other treaties from Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions which could not be allocated on a consistent basis to disaggregation categories or specific accident years.\n\nAs of 31 December\n\n| USD millions                                                                                     | 2023   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net outstanding liabilities                                                                      |        |\n| Property & Casualty Reinsurance                                                                  |        |\n| Property                                                                                         | 10 168 |\n| Liability, proportional                                                                          | 14 461 |\n| Liability, non-proportional                                                                      | 9 445  |\n| Accident & Health                                                                                | 4 853  |\n| Motor, proportional                                                                              | 3 844  |\n| Motor, non-proportional                                                                          | 6 278  |\n| Specialty                                                                                        | 7 149  |\n| Corporate Solutions                                                                              | 8 053  |\n| Life & Health Reinsurance, long tail                                                             | 2 888  |\n| Total net undiscounted outstanding liabilities excluding other short duration contract lines and |        |\n| before unallocated reinsurance recoverable                                                       | 67 139 |\n| Discounting impact on (Life & Health Reinsurance) short duration contracts                       | -248   |\n| Impact of acquisition accounting                                                                 | -302   |\n| Total net discounted outstanding liabilities excluding other short duration contract lines and   |        |\n| before unallocated reinsurance recoverable                                                       | 66 589 |\n| Other short duration contract lines                                                              | 3 365  |\n| Total net discounted outstanding short duration liabilities                                      | 69 954 |\n| Allocated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claims:                                             |        |\n| Property & Casualty Reinsurance                                                                  |        |\n| Property                                                                                         | 518    |\n| Liability, proportional                                                                          | 191    |\n| Liability, non-proportional                                                                      | 189    |\n| Accident & Health                                                                                | 245    |\n| Motor, proportional                                                                              | 46     |\n| Motor, non-proportional                                                                          | 184    |\n| Specialty                                                                                        | 108    |\n| Corporate Solutions                                                                              | 4 856  |\n| Consolidation                                                                                    | -3 530 |\n|                                                                                                  | -48    |\n| Impact of acquisition accounting  Other short duration contract lines                            | 443    |\n| Total short duration reinsurance recoverable on outstanding liabilities                          | 3 202  |\n| Exclusions:                                                                                      |        |\n| Unallocated claim adjustment expenses                                                            | 1 243  |\n| Long duration contracts                                                                          | 13 114 |\n| Total other reconciling items                                                                    | 14 357 |\n| Total unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses                                                | 87 513 |",

Impairment is determined on an individual security basis.\n\nFor securities identified as credit-impaired, the calculation of the estimated credit loss amount includes forward-looking credit information incorporating macro-economic factors as well as credit ratings and is determined by discounting the expected cash shortfalls with the effective interest rate and multiplying with PD (probability of default) and LGD (loss given default). The Group includes accrued interest in the amortised cost basis to estimate expected credit losses.\n\nA reconciliation of the allowance for credit losses related to fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale, aggregated by major investment category is presented as follows:\n\n| 2023  USD millions                               | Debt securities issued  by governments and  government agencies   | Corporate debt  securities   | Mortgage-and asset-  backed securities   | Total   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------|\n| Balance as of 1 January                          | 0                                                                 | 0                            | 0                                        | 0       |\n| Impact of ASC 326 1                              | 7                                                                 | 30                           | 5                                        | 42      |\n| Securities for which allowance for credit losses |                                                                   |                              |                                          |         |\n| were not previously recorded                     |                                                                   | 7                            | 1                                        | 8       |\n| Additions/ reductions in allowance recorded      |                                                                   |                              |                                          |         |\n| on previously impaired securities                | -3                                                                | -7                           | 1                                        | -9      |\n| Securities sold during the period                |                                                                   | -2                           |                                          | -2      |\n| Balance as of 31 December                        | 4                                                                 | 28                           | 7                                        | 39      |\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, and prior to the adoption of ASC 326 'Financial Instruments - Credit Losses' standard, other-than-temporary impairments related to credit losses amounted to USD 60 million.",

|\n\nFor fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale with significant declines in fair value, the Group performs a qualitative and quantitative credit analysis to determine whether the decline in value necessitates the recognition of an allowance for credit losses. The Group considers multiple factors when performing the analysis including the issuer's ability to meet contractual payments, the issuer's credit profile, the evolution of the security's credit rating and relevant characteristics of the security. If the Group determines that unrealised losses are due to non-credit factors, these losses are recognised in other comprehensive income and no allowance for credit losses is recognised in earnings.",

The loans are spread across numerous counterparties largely based in the US and UK with no specific high risk regarding credit concentration. There were no significant mortgage and other loans positions for which payments of contractual principal or interest were past due as of 31 December 2023.\n\nInvestment real estate held by the Group includes residential and commercial investment real estate. Depreciation expense related to investment real estate was USD 79 million and USD 72 million for 2022 and 2023, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on investment real estate totalled USD 829 million and USD 903 million as of 31 December 2022 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Allowance for credit impairments on mortgage and other loans\n\nAllowance for credit losses on mortgage and other loans are estimated on an expected loss basis using a model that utilises probability of default and loss given default methods over the contractual lifetime of the instrument. Within the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the allowance for credit losses for mortgage and other loans is established based on a pool considering the risk associated within the designated pool. If similar risk characteristics do not exist or when individual instruments no longer have similar credit risk characteristics, they are removed from the pool and the allowance is measured on an individual asset basis. The Group includes accrued interest in the amortised cost basis to estimate expected credit losses.",

The fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for each financial instrument received or pledged by the Group. Management believes that master netting agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure. Upon occurrence of an event of default, the non-defaulting party may set off the obligation against collateral received regardless if it has been offset on the balance sheet prior to the defaulting event. The net amounts of the financial assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet were recognised in 'Other invested assets' and 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities'.",

        "page_content": "## 8 Fair value disclosures\n\nFair value, as defined by the Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nThe Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures Topic requires all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value to be categorised within the fair value hierarchy. This three-level hierarchy is based on the observability of the inputs used in the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has the ability to access. Level 1 inputs are the most persuasive evidence of fair value and are to be used whenever possible. The types of instruments include most US government and sovereign obligations, active listed equities, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments and most money market securities.\n\nLevel 2 inputs are market-based inputs that are directly or indirectly observable, but not considered level 1 quoted prices. Level 2 inputs consist of (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non-active markets (eg markets which have few transactions and where prices are not current or price quotations vary substantially); (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable (eg interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks and default rates); (iv) inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and (v) quoted prices provided by third party brokers. The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage- and asset-backed products, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments, catastrophe bonds, less liquid listed equities and state, municipal and provincial obligations.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. These inputs reflect the Group's own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Certain financial instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments include private equity, less liquid corporate debt securities and certain asset-backed securities (ABS). Certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nPursuant to the election of the fair value option, the Group classifies certain liabilities for life and health policy benefits in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nThe fair values of assets are adjusted to incorporate the counterparty risk of non-performance. Similarly, the fair values of liabilities reflect the risk of non-performance of the Group, captured by the Group's credit spread. These valuation adjustments from assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs are recognised in net realised gains and losses. For 2023, these adjustments were not material. Whenever the underlying assets or liabilities are reported in a specific business segment, the valuation adjustment is allocated accordingly. Valuation adjustments not attributable to any business segment are reported in Group items.\n\nIn certain situations, the Group uses inputs to measure the fair value of asset or liability positions that fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Group will determine the appropriate level based on the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nUS government securities typically have quoted market prices in active markets and are categorised as level 1 instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Non-US government holdings are generally classified as level 2 instruments and are valued on the basis of the quotes provided by pricing services, which are subject to the Group's pricing validation reviews and pricing vendor challenge process. Valuations provided by pricing vendors are generally based on the actual trade information as substantially all of the Group's non-US government holdings are traded in a transparent and liquid market.\n\nCorporate debt securities mainly include US and European investment-grade positions, which are priced on the basis of quotes provided by third party pricing vendors and first utilise valuation inputs from actively traded securities, such as bid prices, bid spreads to Treasury securities, Treasury curves and same or comparable issuer curves and spreads. Issuer spreads are determined from actual quotes and traded prices and incorporate considerations of credit/default, sector composition, and liquidity and call features. Where market data is not available, valuations are developed based on the modelling techniques that utilise observable inputs and option-adjusted spreads and incorporate considerations of the security's seniority, maturity and corporate structure of the issuer.\n\nValues of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are obtained both from third party pricing vendors and through quoted prices, some of which may be based on the prices of comparable securities with similar structural and collateral features. Values of certain ABS for which there are no significant observable inputs are developed using benchmarks to similar transactions or indices. For both residential mortgagebacked securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), cash flows are derived based on the transaction-specific",

        "page_content": "information, which incorporates priority in the capital structure, and are generally adjusted to reflect benchmark yields, market prepayment data, collateral performance (default rates and loss severity) for specific vintage and geography, credit enhancements and ratings. For certain RMBS and CMBS with low levels of market liquidity, judgements may be required to determine comparable securities based on the loan type and deal-specific performance. CMBS terms may also incorporate lock-out periods that restrict borrowers from prepaying the loans or provide disincentives to prepay and therefore reduce prepayment risk of these securities, compared to RMBS. The factors specifically considered in valuation of CMBS include borrower-specific statistics in a specific region, such as debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, as well as the type of commercial property. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities also includes debt securitised by credit card, student loan and auto loan receivables. Pricing inputs for these securities also focus on capturing, where relevant, collateral quality and performance, payment patterns and delinquencies.\n\nThe Group uses third party pricing vendor data to value agency securitised products, which mainly include collateralised mortgage obligations (CMO) and mortgage-backed government agency securities. The valuations generally utilise observable inputs consistent with those noted above for RMBS and CMBS.\n\nEquity securities held by the Group for proprietary investment purposes are mainly classified in level 1. Securities classified in level 1 are traded on public stock exchanges for which quoted prices are readily available.\n\nThe category 'Other invested assets' includes the Group's private equity and hedge fund investments which are made directly or via ownership of funds. Valuation of direct private equity investments requires significant management judgement due to the absence of quoted market prices and the lack of liquidity. Initial valuation is based on the acquisition cost and is further refined based on the available market information for the public companies that are considered comparable to the Group's holdings in the private companies being valued, and the private company-specific performance indicators, both historic and projected. Subsequent valuations also reflect business or asset appraisals, as well as market transaction data for private and public benchmark companies and the actual companies being valued, such as financing rounds and mergers and acquisitions activity. The Group's holdings in private equity and hedge funds are generally valued utilising net asset values (NAV), subject to adjustments, as deemed necessary, for restrictions on redemption (lock-up periods and amount limitations on redemptions). These investments are included under investments measured at net asset value as a practical expedient.\n\nThe Group holds both exchange-traded and OTC interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and equity derivative contracts for hedging and trading purposes. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives measured using observable exchange prices are classified in level 1. Long-dated contracts may require adjustments to the exchange-traded prices which would trigger reclassification to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives are generally valued by the Group based on the internal models, which are consistent with industry standards and practices, and use both observable (dealer, broker or market consensus prices, spot and forward rates, interest rate and credit curves and volatility indices) and unobservable inputs (adjustments for liquidity, inputs derived from the observable data based on the Group's judgements and assumptions).\n\nThe Group's OTC interest rate derivatives primarily include interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and floors and are valued based on the cash flow discounting models which generally utilise as inputs observable market yield curves and volatility assumptions.\n\nThe Group's OTC foreign exchange derivatives primarily include forward, spot and option contracts and are generally valued based on the cash flow discounting models, utilising as main inputs observable foreign exchange forward curves.\n\nThe Group's investments in equity derivatives primarily include OTC equity option contracts on single or baskets of market indices and equity options on individual or baskets of equity securities, which are valued using internally developed models (such as the Black-Scholes type option pricing model and various simulation models) calibrated with the inputs, which include underlying spot prices, dividend curves, volatility surfaces, yield curves and correlations between underlying assets.\n\nThe Group's OTC credit derivatives can include index and single-name credit default swaps. Plain vanilla credit derivatives, such as index and single-name credit default swaps, are valued by the Group based on the models consistent with the industry valuation standards for these credit contracts, and primarily utilise observable inputs published by market data sources, such as credit spreads and recovery rates. These valuation techniques warrant classification of plain vanilla OTC derivatives as level 2 financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.",

A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement corporate debt securities is credit spread. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement credit tenant leases is illiquidity premium. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's variable annuity and fair valued guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) contracts are: risk margin, volatility, lapse, mortality improvement rate and withdrawal rate. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in each of the following inputs: risk margin, volatility and withdrawal rate would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value of the Group's obligation. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in lapse rate would, in general, have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value of the Group's obligation due to the maturity of the contracts. Changes in the mortality improvement rate impact the fair value of the Group's obligation differently for living-benefit products, compared to death-benefit products. For the former, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality improvement rate (ie decrease (increase) in mortality) in isolation would have resulted in a decrease (increase) in fair value of the Group's liability. For the latter, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality improvement rate in isolation would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in fair value of the Group's liability.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's weather contracts are risk margin, correlation, volatility and index value. Where the Group has a long position, a significant increase (decrease) in the risk margin input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short position, a significant increase (decrease) in the risk margin input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.",

Fees may apply for redemptions or transferring of interest to other parties. Distributions are expected to be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated. The period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated is indeterminate as investees provide liquidation notices.\n\nThe private equity direct portfolio consists of equity and equity-like investments directly in other companies. These investments have no contractual term and are generally held based on financial or strategic intent.\n\nThe hedge fund investments employ a variety of strategies, including relative value and event-driven across various asset classes.\n\nThe redemption frequency of hedge funds varies depending on the manager as well as the nature of the underlying product. Additionally, certain funds may impose lock-up periods and redemption gates as defined in the terms of the individual investment agreement.\n\n## Fair value option\n\nThe fair value option under the Financial Instruments Topic permits the choice to measure specified financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The Group elected the fair value option for positions in the following line items:\n\n## Other invested assets\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for certain investments classified as equity method investees within other invested assets in the balance sheet. The Group applied the fair value option, as the investments are managed on a fair value basis. The changes in fair value of these elected investments are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Funds held by ceding companies\n\nFor operational efficiencies, the Group elected the fair value option for funds held by the cedent under three of its reinsurance agreements. The assets are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reported as a component of earnings.\n\n## Liabilities for life and health policy benefits\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for existing GMDB reserves related to certain variable annuity contracts. The Group has applied the fair value option, as the equity risk associated with those contracts is managed on a fair value basis and it is economically hedged with derivative options in the market. The liability is carried at fair value and changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk are reported in other comprehensive income and all other changes in fair value are reported as a component of earnings.\n\n## Assets and liabilities measured at fair value pursuant to election of the fair value option\n\nPursuant to the election of the fair value option for the items described, the balances as of 31 December were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                             | 2022    | 2023    |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n| Assets                                                   |         |         |\n| Other invested assets                                    | 8 794   | 11 510  |\n| of which at fair value pursuant to the fair value option | 435     | 415     |\n| Funds held by ceding companies                           | 13 929  | 16 178  |\n| of which at fair value pursuant to the fair value option | 164     | 166     |\n| Liabilities                                              |         |         |\n| Liabilities for life and health policy benefits          | -20 925 | -20 624 |\n| of which at fair value pursuant to the fair value option | -69     | -58     |",

Some of these positions need to be assessed in conjunction with the corresponding insurance business, whilst the fair value of some other positions does not differ materially from the carrying amount. Considering these circumstances for these positions, the Group presents the carrying amount as an approximation for the fair value. For certain commercial mortgage loans and infrastructure loans, which are included in mortgage loans and other loans respectively, the fair value can be estimated using discounted cash flow models which are based on discount curves and spread inputs that require management's judgement.\n\nInvestments in real estate are fair valued primarily by external appraisers based on proprietary discounted cash flow models that incorporate applicable risk premium adjustments to discount yields and projected market rental income streams based on market-specific data. These fair value measurements are classified in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDebt positions, which are fair valued based on executable broker quotes or the discounted cash flow method using observable inputs, are classified as level 2 measurements. Fair value of the majority of the Group's level 3 debt positions is judged to approximate carrying value due to the highly tailored nature of the obligation and short-notice termination provisions.",

        "page_content": "## 9 Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, options, forwards, credit derivatives and exchange-traded financial futures in its trading and hedging strategies, in line with the Group's overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purchases, existing assets or liabilities, as well as locking in attractive investment conditions for future available funds.\n\nThe fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group. The gross fair values are not an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA master agreements or their equivalent. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure.",

These derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December, the gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                   | 2023  Other comprehensive income  - Cash flow hedges   |\n|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|\n| Total amounts of income and expense line items | 10                                                     |\n| Interest rate contracts                        |                                                        |\n| Gains/losses on derivatives                    | 10                                                     |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the maximum length of time over which the Group hedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for forecasted transactions, excluding those forecasted transactions related to the payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments, was 6 months.\n\n## Hedges of the net investment in foreign operations\n\nThe Group designates derivative and non-derivative monetary financial instruments as hedging the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain foreign operations.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022 and 2023, the Group recorded an accumulated net unrealised foreign currency remeasurement gain of USD 1 260 million and USD 837 million, respectively, in 'Other comprehensive income - Foreign currency translation'. These offset translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, USD 152 million gains on derivative instruments, designated and qualifying in net investment hedges, were excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.\n\n## Maximum potential loss\n\nIn consideration of the rights of set-off and the qualifying master netting arrangements with various counterparties, the maximum potential loss as of 31 December 2022 and 2023 was approximately USD 484 million and USD 509 million, respectively. The maximum potential loss is based on the positive market replacement cost assuming non-performance of all counterparties, excluding cash collateral.\n\n## Credit risk-related contingent features\n\nCertain derivative instruments held by the Group contain provisions that require its debt to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. If the Group's credit rating were downgraded or no longer rated, the counterparties could request immediate payment, guarantee or an ongoing full overnight collateralisation on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\n\nThe total fair value of derivative financial instruments containing credit risk-related contingent features amounted to USD 54 million and USD 37 million as of 31 December 2022 and 2023, respectively. For derivative financial instruments containing credit risk-related contingent features, the Group posted collateral of USD 34 million and USD 29 million as of 31 December 2022 and 2023, respectively. In the event of a reduction of the Group's credit rating to below investment grade, a fair value of USD 9 million additional collateral would have had to be posted as of 31 December 2023. The total equals the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately as of 31 December 2023.\n\n## Credit derivatives written/sold\n\nDuring 2023, the Group wrote/sold credit swaptions, options on CDS in investment grade indices. CDSs are contracts in which the buyer of the swap pays a fee in return for a contingent payment by the seller of the swap triggered by a credit event of the underlying entity or asset. Credit swaptions are contracts that provide the holder with the right, but not the obligation, to enter into a credit default swap in the future at a specified date and spread.\n\nThese activities are part of the Group's overall portfolio and risk management strategies. The events that could require the Group to perform include the movement of credit spreads beyond defined trigger levels resulting in the exercise of the swaption by the counterparty and thereafter the occurrence of a credit event (which may include, bankruptcy, failure to pay or involuntary restructuring) of the credit derivative's underlying. Payout on a credit default swap is only triggered after the credit derivatives determinations committee determines that a credit event has occurred.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the total fair value (representing gross carrying amounts, excluding the effects of cash collateral netting) of written/sold options on credit derivatives was nil with a maximum potential payout of USD 4 000 million and a time to maturity of less than five years. The maximum potential payout is based on notional values of the credit derivatives assuming the swaption is exercised and the default of all credit derivatives' underlyings with zero recovery.\n\nThe Group believes that the maximum potential payout is not representative of the actual loss exposure based on historical experience. This amount has not been reduced by the Group's rights to the underlying assets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit",

The net impact of the change in the fair value of the debt and interest rate swap is reflected in the interest expense line in the income statement but not in the table above. For more details on the hedging, please refer to Note 9 'Derivative financial instruments'.\n\n## Convertible debt\n\nIn June 2018, SRL issued six-year senior unsecured exchangeable notes with issuer stock settlement. The notes have a face value of USD 500 million, with a fixed coupon of 3.25% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrear until the maturity date (13 June 2024). Subject to the conditions of the notes, noteholders may exchange their notes for ordinary shares of SRL at an exchange price of USD 94.1610 (adjusted from the initial exchange price of USD 115.2593). The exchange price is subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances described in the conditions of the notes. The issuer may elect to settle a noteholder-initiated exchange in cash or SRL shares. To economically offset the settlement of a noteholder-initiated exchange, SRL purchased matching call options on SRL shares with a portion of the proceeds. Consequently, no new SRL shares will be issued upon a noteholder-initiated exchange. Assuming that all of the notes are exchanged at the request of noteholders, and subject to further adjustments to the exchange price as described in the conditions of the notes, 5 310 054 existing registered shares of SRL would have to be delivered to noteholders. Both the noteholder-initiated exchange option and the matching call options are accounted as equity within these financial statements.\n\n## Long-term debt issued in 2023\n\nIn May 2023, Swiss Re Ltd issued perpetual subordinated fixed spread callable loan notes with an aggregate face value of USD 750 million by fully drawing on the subordinated debt facility established in July 2017. The notes are perpetual with a next optional redemption date of 15 August 2027 and additional optional redemption dates every five years thereafter. Swiss Re Ltd pays a fixed coupon of 5.524% per annum until the next optional redemption date, which will be reset every five years to the prevailing five-year US Treasury rate plus the fixedfor-life spread of 2.764%.",

Renewal or termination options that are reasonably certain of exercise by the lessee are included in the lease term. The lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n\n## Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets\n\nLease liabilities and right-of-use assets for operating leases as of 31 December were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                        |   2022 |   2023 |\n|-------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Operating lease right-of-use assets |    396 |    406 |\n| Operating lease liabilities         |    441 |    455 |\n\nOperating lease right-of-use assets are included in 'Other assets' and operating lease liabilities are included in 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' on the balance sheet.\n\n## Maturity of lease liabilities\n\nAs of 31 December, the total undiscounted cash flows due to operating leases for the next five years and thereafter were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                       |   2022 |   2023 |\n|------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Less than one year                 |     71 |     73 |\n| Between one year and two years     |     65 |     70 |\n| Between two years and three years  |     55 |     68 |\n| Between three years and four years |     52 |     60 |\n| Between four years and five years  |     46 |     50 |\n| After five years                   |    227 |    210 |\n| Total undiscounted cash flows      |    516 |    531 |\n| Less imputed interest              |    -75 |    -76 |\n| Total lease liability              |    441 |    455 |\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, undiscounted sublease cash flows over the next eight years were USD 53 million.\n\nThe discount rates used to determine the lease liability reflect the collateralised borrowing rates for the Group, where the underlying collateral is assumed to be real estate.\n\nThe weighted average discount rate for operating leases as of 31 December 2022 and 2023 was 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively. The weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases as of 31 December 2022 and 2023 was 10.7 years and 10.1 years, respectively.\n\n## Lease cost\n\nThe composition of total lease cost for all operating leases for the year ended 31 December was as follows:\n\n| USD millions                               |   2022 |   2023 |\n|--------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Fixed operating lease cost                 |     80 |     70 |\n| Other lease cost 1                         |      5 |      6 |\n| Total operating lease cost                 |     85 |     76 |\n| Less sublease income from operating leases |     -4 |     -8 |\n| Total lease cost                           |     81 |     68 |\n\n## Other information\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022 and 2023, cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was USD 82 million and USD 72 million, respectively. Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities in 2022 and 2023 were USD 72 million and USD 70 million, respectively.",

The Group has the intent and ability to control all distributions from foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner. Deferred tax liabilities or additional foreign withholding tax liabilities will be recognised if the Group can no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. As of 31 December 2023, the US GAAP undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries was USD 7.9 billion. Due to the differences in US GAAP and local tax basis of undistributed earnings, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liability if these earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had USD 13 051 million net operating tax loss carryforwards, expiring as follows: USD 12 million in 2024, USD 43 million in 2025, USD 70 million in 2026, USD 512 million in 2027, USD 7 056 million in 2028 and beyond and USD 5 358 million never expire.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, the Group had capital loss carryforwards of USD 721 million, expiring as follows: USD 12 million in 2025, USD 6 million in 2027, USD 140 million in 2028 and beyond, and USD 563 million never expire.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2023, net operating tax losses of USD 3 530 million and net capital tax losses of nil were utilised.",

        "page_content": "The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2022 and 2023 was USD 361 million and USD 419 million, respectively. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended 31 December 2023 was an increase of USD 58 million, with a USD 9 million increase driven by balance sheet translation recorded in equity and a USD 49 million net increase included as a tax charge in income tax from operations.\n\nThe valuation allowance as of 31 December 2023 was primarily related to loss carryforwards and intangible assets that, in the judgement of management, are not more likely than not to be realised. In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.\n\nManagement considers projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are deductible, management believes that is more likely than not that the Group will realise the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance as of 31 December 2023. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.\n\nSubsequently recognised tax benefits related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2023 will be allocated entirely to income tax from operations.\n\nIncome taxes paid in 2022 and 2023 were USD 419 million and USD 524 million, respectively.\n\n## Unrecognised tax benefits\n\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing amount of gross unrecognised tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) is as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                             | 2022   | 2023   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of 1 January                                  | 143    | 152    |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to current year | 14     | 13     |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to prior years  | 14     | 12     |\n| Reductions for tax positions of current year             | -2     | -2     |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior years              | -5     | -4     |\n| Statute expiration                                       |        | -3     |\n| Settlements                                              | -7     |        |\n| Other (including foreign currency translation)           | -5     | 8      |\n| Balance as of 31 December                                | 152    | 176    |\n\nAs of 31 December 2022 and 2023, the amount of gross unrecognised tax benefits within the tabular reconciliation that, if recognised, would affect the effective tax rate were approximately USD 152 million and USD 176 million, respectively.\n\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense/benefit. For the years ended 31 December 2022 and 2023, such expenses were USD 4 million and nil respectively. For the years ended 31 December 2022 and 2023, USD 37 million and USD 37 million, respectively, were accrued for the payment of interest (net of tax benefits) and penalties. The accrued interest balance as of 31 December 2023 is included within the deferred and other non-current taxes section reflected above and in the balance sheet.\n\nThe balance of gross unrecognised tax benefits as of 31 December 2023 presented in the table above excludes accrued interest and penalties (USD 37 million).\n\nDuring the year, certain tax positions and audits in Canada, India, Italy, Singapore and Switzerland were effectively settled.\n\nThe Group continually evaluates proposed adjustments by taxing authorities. The Group believes that it is reasonably possible (more than remote and less than likely) that the balance of unrecognised tax benefits could decrease by USD 121 million over the next 12 months due to settlements or expiration of statutes. It is also reasonably possible that the balance could increase as a result of proposed adjustments by taxing authorities. Quantification of an estimated range of increases cannot be made at this time.",

Generally employees become eligible for these benefits when they become eligible for pension benefits.\n\nThe measurement date of these plans is 31 December for each year presented.\n\n| 2022  USD

Tactical allocation decisions that reflect this strategy are made on a quarterly basis, including balancing the investment portfolios between equity and fixed income securities.",

Real estate reported on level 3 is property owned by the pension funds. These positions are accounted for at the capitalised income value. The capitalisation based on sustainable recoverable earnings is conducted at interest rates that are determined individually for each property, based on the property's location, age and condition. If properties are intended for disposal, the estimated selling costs and taxes are recognised in provisions. Sales gains or losses are allocated to income from real estate when the contract is concluded.\n\nThe fair value of the insurance contract is based on the fair value of the assets backing the contract.\n\nAs of 31 December, the fair values of pension plan assets were as follows:\n\n|                            | Fair value                                                        | Fair value

        "page_content": "## 16 Share-based payments\n\nAs of 31 December 2022 and 2023, the Group had the share-based compensation plans as described below.\n\nThe total compensation cost for share-based compensation plans recognised in net income was USD 59 million and USD 101 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The related tax benefit was USD 12 million and USD 20 million, respectively.\n\n## Restricted shares\n\nThe Group granted 37 704 and 177 255 restricted share units to selected employees in 2022 and 2023, respectively. All restricted share units granted as of 2023 are entitled to a dividend equivalent (equal value to actual Swiss Re dividends), settled in shares at the end of the vesting period.\n\nAs part of the Deferred Share Plan (DSP), the Group granted 163 541 restricted share units in 2023. Each DSP grant is entitled to a dividend equivalent (equal value to actual Swiss Re dividends), accrued annually and settled in shares at the end of the vesting period. The DSP is a mandatory three-year deferral of a portion of the Annual Performance Incentive (API) when the total API amount for an employee equals or exceeds defined thresholds.\n\nIn addition, 41 855 and 34 162 restricted shares were delivered to members of the Board of Directors during 2022 and 2023, respectively, which are generally not subject to forfeiture risk.\n\nA summary of the movements in shares relating to outstanding awards granted under the restricted share plans for the year ended 31 December 2023 is as follows:\n\n|                               |   Weighted average grant date fair value in CHF 1 | Number of shares   |\n|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|\n| Non-vested at 1 January       |                                                83 | 259 467            |\n| Granted                       |                                                92 | 374 958            |\n| Forfeited                     |                                                86 | -15 014            |\n| Vested                        |                                                89 | -77 776            |\n| Outstanding as of 31 December |                                                88 | 541 635            |\n\n## Leadership Performance Plan/Leadership Share Plan\n\nThe Leadership Performance Plan (LPP)/Leadership Share Plan (LSP) awards are expected to be settled in shares, and the requisite service as well as the maximum contractual term are three years. For LPP 2020, LSP 2021, LSP 2022 and LSP 2023 awards, an additional two-year holding period applies for all members of the Group EC and other key executives. At grant date, LPP 2020 was split equally into three underlying components of Performance Share Units (PSUs). The ROE PSUs are measured against a return on equity performance condition and will vest within a range of 0-100%. The TSR PSUs are based on relative total shareholder return, measured against a pre-defined group of peers and will vest within a range of 0-200%. The ENW PSUs, being the third component, are measured against ENW growth performance and will vest within a range of 0-100%. As of 2021, the LSP succeeded the LPP, whereby depending on the corporate band of the participant, the plan consists of either non-performance based components in the form of Share Units (SUs), separate performancebased components in the form of PSUs, similar to LPP 2020, each vesting within a range of 0-150%, or a mix of both non-performance and performance based components. As of LSP 2023, the ENW performance-based component has been discontinued. Each SU is entitled to a dividend equivalent (equal value to actual Swiss Re dividends), accrued annually and settled in shares at the end of the vesting period. The fair values of all components are determined separately, based on stochastic models.\n\nThe fair value assumptions in the grant valuations include market estimates for dividends for all LPP and LSP awards, and the risk-free rate based on the average of the 10-year US Treasury bond taken monthly over each year in the performance period for LPP 2020 and LSP 2021. Risk-free rates range between 1.5% and 2.2%.",

        "page_content": "## 21 Variable interest entities\n\nThe Group enters into arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. The involvement ranges from being a passive investor to designing, structuring and managing the VIEs. The variable interests held by the Group arise primarily as a result of the Group's involvement in certain insurance-linked securitisations, life and health funding transactions, swaps in trusts, debt financing, investment, senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans as well as other entities, which meet the definition of a VIE.\n\nWhen analysing whether the entity is a VIE, the Group mainly assesses if (1) the equity is sufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) the equity holders have the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations and (3) the holders of the voting rights substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.\n\nWhen one of these criteria is not met, the entity is considered a VIE and is assessed for consolidation under the VIE section of the Consolidation Topic.\n\nThe party that has a controlling financial interest is called a primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The party is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it has both:\n\n- the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and\n- the obligation to absorb the entity's losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nFor all its variable interests in VIEs, the Group assesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in these entities and, thus, is the primary beneficiary. The Group identifies the activities that most significantly impact the entity's performance and determines whether the Group has the power to direct those activities. In conducting the analysis, the Group considers the purpose, the design and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. Additionally, the Group assesses if it has the obligation to absorb losses or if it has the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. If both criteria are met, the Group has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and consolidates the entity.\n\nThe Group monitors changes to the facts and circumstances of the existing involvement with legal entities to determine whether they require reconsideration of the entity's designation as a VIE or voting interest entity. For VIEs, the Group regularly reassesses the primary beneficiary determination.\n\n## Insurance-linked securitisations\n\nThe insurance-linked securitisations transfer pre-existing insurance risk to investors through the issuance of insurance-linked securities. In insurance-linked securitisations, the securitisation vehicle assumes the insurance risk from a sponsor through insurance or derivative contracts. The securitisation vehicle generally retains the issuance proceeds as collateral, which consists of investment-grade securities. The Group does not have potentially significant variable interest in these vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary.\n\nTypically, the variable interests held by the Group arise through ownership of insurance-linked securities, in which case the Group's maximum loss equals the principal amount of the securities held by the Group.\n\n## Life and health funding vehicles\n\nThe Group participates in certain structured transactions that retrocede longevity and mortality risks to captive reinsurers with an aim to provide regulatory capital credit to a transaction sponsor through the creation of funding notes by a separate funding vehicle which is generally considered a VIE. The Group's participation in these transactions is generally limited to providing contingent funding support via a financial contract with a funding vehicle, which represents a potentially significant variable interest in the funding vehicle. The Group does not have power to direct activities of the funding vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary of the funding vehicles in these transactions. The Group's maximum exposure in these transactions equals either the total contract notional or outstanding balance of the funding notes issued by the vehicle, depending on the specific contractual arrangements.\n\n## Swaps in trusts\n\nThe Group provides interest rate and foreign exchange risk hedges to certain asset securitisation trusts which qualify as VIEs. As the Group's involvement is limited to interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, it does not have the power to direct any activities of the trusts and therefore does not qualify as primary beneficiary of any of these trusts. These activities are in run-off.\n\n## Investment vehicles\n\nThe Group's variable interests in investment partnerships arise through ownership of the limited partner interests. Many investment partnerships are VIEs because the limited partners as a group lack kick-out or participating rights. The Group does not hold the general partner interest in the limited partnerships and therefore does not direct investment activities of the entity. Therefore, the Group lacks power over the relevant activities of the vehicles and, consequently, does not qualify as the primary beneficiary. The Group is exposed to losses when the values of the investments held by the investment vehicles decrease. The Group's maximum exposure to loss equals the Group's share of the investment.",

        "page_content": "The Group is a passive investor in structured securitisation vehicles issuing residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities (RMBS and CMBS, respectively) and other asset-backed securities (ABS). The Group's investments in RMBS, CMBS and other ABS are passive in nature and do not obligate the Group to provide any financial or other support to the issuer entities. By design, RMBS, CMBS and ABS securitisation entities are not adequately capitalised and therefore considered VIEs. The Group is not the primary beneficiary, because it does not have power to direct most significant activities. These investments are accounted for as available-for-sale as described in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\nThe Group consolidates an investment vehicle, because the Group holds the entire interest in the entity and makes investment decisions related to the entity. The investment vehicle is a VIE because it is structured as an umbrella company comprised of multiple sub-funds. The majority of the investments held in this vehicle are accounted for as available-for-sale and are disclosed in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\n## Investment vehicles for unit-linked business\n\nAdditionally, the Group invests on behalf of the policyholders as a passive investor in a variety of investment funds across various jurisdictions. By design, many of these funds meet a VIE definition. While the Group may have a potentially significant variable interest in some of these entities due to its share of the fund's total net assets, it does not have power over the fund's investment decisions or unilateral kick-out rights relative to the decision maker.\n\nThe Group is not exposed to losses in the aforementioned investment vehicles, as the investment risk is borne by the policyholder.\n\n## Senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans\n\nThe Group also invests in structured commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans, which are held for investment.\n\nThe commercial mortgage loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with commercial real estate. The entities are adequately capitalised and generally structured as voting interest entities. Occasionally, the borrower entities can be structured as limited partnerships where the limited partners do not have kick-out or participating rights, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe infrastructure loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with infrastructure project assets. Some borrower entities may have insufficient equity investment at risk, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe Group does not have power over the activities most significant to the aforementioned borrower entities designated as VIEs and therefore does not consolidate them.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss from its investments equals the loan outstanding amount.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Group did not provide financial or other support to any VIEs during 2023 that it was not previously contractually required to provide.",

This balance is comprised of debt securities issued by governments and government agencies, corporations, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. This amount is included in the fixed income securities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe determination of the fair value of these investments is based on assumptions, including credit and valuation spreads. The determination of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as the assumptions are based on internal estimates. The valuation of fixed income securities has been designated as a key audit matter given changes in the estimate could have a material impact on consolidated balance sheet. Auditing this balance involved an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialized skills and knowledge, due to the estimate uncertainty associated with the assumptions.\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of fixed income securities.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the data used in the fair value estimation by reconciling to source information.\n\nWe involved our valuation specialists with specialized skills and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Assessing the pricing methodologies with reference to relevant accounting standards, and industry practice.\n- -Developing an independent estimate for a selection of securities, and comparison of the independent estimate to the Group's fair value estimate.\n\nFor further information on the Valuation of Fixed Income Securities refer to the following:\n\n- -  Note 1\n\n-  Note 7\n\n- -  Note 8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VALUATION OF LIFE AND HEALTH RESERVES\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Group has recorded life and health reserves of $43,471 million as of 31 December 2023. Life, and health reserves are included in the life and health related unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, liabilities for life and health policy benefits, and policyholder account balances line items on the consolidated balance sheet (collectively, life and health reserves).\n\nThe determination or revision of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as these assumptions are generally not based on observable market inputs.\n\nThese assumptions include mortality, morbidity, withdrawals, persistency (lapse), benefit termination rates and lag factors. Additional uncertainties related to the mortality assumption have arisen due to the on-going Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe valuation of life and health reserves has been designated as a key audit matter given the material nature of the balance and the significant estimation\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of life and health reserves. Further, we tested the design and implementation of certain key controls within the process, including the independent actuarial peer review and reserving committee level reviews.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the underlying policyholder contract data by reconciling to source information.\n\nWe involved our actuarial specialists with specialized skills, and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Evaluating the methods applied to select the mortality, morbidity, persistency (lapse), benefit termination rates and lag factor assumptions by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial techniques;\n- -Challenging the selected mortality, morbidity, persistency (lapse), benefit termination rates and",

Property and casualty reserves is included in the property and casualty related unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses line item on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe determination of assumptions used to develop the estimate requires subjectivity and judgment as these assumptions are generally not based on observable market inputs. Among the most significant assumptions are the initial estimates of loss ratios, which are used to estimate liabilities in the most recent accident years. Other assumptions include but are not limited to changes in exposure, inflation trends, claims emergence trends, and other legal or regulatory decisions.\n\nProperty and casualty reserves associated with longtail lines of business, such as Liability, Asbestos and Environmental and Motor, generally require more subjectivity, and judgment due to the length of the claim reporting period resulting in increased volatility of claims frequency, and severity trends.\n\nThe valuation of property and casualty reserves has been designated as a key audit matter given the material nature of the balance and the significant estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial assumptions. Auditing the estimate involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialists with specialized skills and knowledge.\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of property and casualty reserves. Further, we tested the design, and implementation of certain key controls within the process, including the independent peer review and committee level reviews.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the underlying data by reconciling to source information, and validating the appropriateness of claims triangles.\n\nWe involved our actuarial specialists with specialized skills, and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Evaluating the methods applied to select the actuarial assumptions by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial techniques;\n- -Evaluating the Group's estimates by performing independent calculations of property and casualty reserves for certain lines of business;\n- -For certain lines of business where we performed independent calculations, developing a range of reserve estimates, and assessing the position of the Group's recorded reserve relative to the range;\n- -Assessing the Group's internally prepared actuarial analyses in comparison to internal experience, and related industry trends for certain lines of business.\n\nFor further information on the Valuation of Property and Casualty Reserves refer to the following:\n\n-  Note 1\n\n-  Note 5",

The determination of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as the assumptions are based on internal estimates.\n\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets has been designated as a key audit matter given changes in the estimate could have a material impact on net income (through income tax expense). Auditing the estimate involved an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialized skills and knowledge, due to the estimation uncertainty associated with the assumptions.\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of deferred tax assets. Further, we tested the design, and implementation of certain key controls within the process, including independent review of items for valuation and recognition.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the underlying data by reconciling to source information.\n\nWe involve our tax specialists with specialized skills, and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Assessing the future profitability assumption by performing sensitivity analyses, and the feasibility of the tax planning measures.\n\n## For further information on the Valuation of Deferred Tax Assets on Loss Carryforwards refer to the following:\n\n- -Note 1\n- -Note 14\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and the fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and the provisions of Swiss law, and for the design, implementation, and maintenance of  internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation and fair presentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the date that the consolidated financial statements are available to be issued; to disclose, as applicable, matters related to going concern; and to use  the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment or economic decisions made by a reasonable user based on these consolidated financial statements.",

We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- -  Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe are required to communicate with the Board of Directors  regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters, including any significant deficiencies that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Other Information in the Annual Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information included in the annual report. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the company, the compensation report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the consolidated financial statements, or our knowledge obtained in the audit or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs at year-end exchange rates, with the exception of participations, which are reported in Swiss francs at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, short-term deposits and certain investments in money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less. Such current assets are held at nominal value.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments contain investments with an original maturity between three months and one year. Such investments are carried at cost, less necessary and legally permissible depreciation.\n\n## Receivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/Other receivables\n\nThese assets are generally carried at nominal value. Value adjustments are recorded where the expected recovery value is lower than the nominal value.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/Other receivables also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\n## Accrued income\n\nAccrued income consists of both other expenditures incurred during the financial year but relating to a subsequent financial year, and revenues relating to the current financial year but receivable in a subsequent financial year.\n\n## Loans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nLoans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies are carried at nominal value.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nThese assets are carried at cost less necessary value adjustments to reflect other than temporary decreases in the value in use.\n\nIn 2023, the direct subsidiary Swiss Re Finance UK plc was transferred to the direct subsidiary Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd in the form of a contribution in kind with effective date of 16 May 2023. As a result, the Company increased the carrying amount of the investment in Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd by the carrying amount of the investment in Swiss Re Finance UK plc. The contribution in kind had no impact on the Company's total assets, total liabilities or total shareholders' equity. Further details are provided in Note 6 'Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies'.\n\n## Payables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/Other liabilities\n\nThese liabilities are generally carried at nominal value.\n\nPayables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/Other liabilities also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.",

        "page_content": "## Accrued expenses\n\nAccrued expenses consist of both income received before the balance sheet date but relating to a subsequent financial year, and charges relating to the current financial year but payable in a subsequent financial year.\n\n## Loans from subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nLoans from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are carried at nominal value.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions contain provision for currency fluctuation and provision for taxation.\n\nThe provision for currency fluctuation comprises the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the revaluation of the balance sheet at year-end. These net impacts are recognised in the income statement over a period of up to three years. Where the provision for currency fluctuation is insufficient to absorb net foreign exchange losses for the financial year, the provision for currency fluctuation is reduced to zero and the excess foreign exchange loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe provision for taxation represents an estimate of taxes payable in respect of the reporting year.\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt is held at redemption value.\n\n## Other legal capital reserves\n\nOther legal capital reserves reflect gains and losses from sale of own shares (directly held by the Company).\n\n## Reserve for own shares (indirectly held by subsidiaries)\n\nReserve for own shares is accounted for at the book value of those shares in the statutory financial statements of the respective subsidiary.\n\n## Own shares (directly held by the Company)\n\nOwn shares are carried at cost and presented as a deduction in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign exchange transactions are recognised in the income statement and reported in other revenues or other expenses, respectively.\n\n## Dividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised as investment income in the year in which they are declared.\n\n## Trademark licence fees\n\nTrademark licence fees are charged by the Company to its direct and indirect subsidiaries and their branches that benefit from the use of the Swiss Re brand.\n\n## Capital and indirect taxes\n\nCapital and indirect taxes related to the financial year are included in other expenses. Value-added taxes are included in the respective expense lines in the income statement.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nSwiss Re Ltd is subject to ordinary income taxation at cantonal/communal and federal level.\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are indirectly exempt from income taxation (participation relief).\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 12 March 2024. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.",

The maximum commitment under the repurchased subordinated debt facilities for both drawn and undrawn amounts were subsequently reduced by the same amount.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, subordinated notes in the amount of CHF 1 664 million (2022: CHF 1 758 million) were issued under the facilities.\n\nThe following tables provide an overview of the subordinated debt facilities as of 31 December 2023 and 2022, respectively:\n\n| As of 31 December 2023                                            |   Issued   in | Currency   |   Nominal  value in  millions |   Nominal value in  millions drawn 3 | Commitment fee  (paid on undrawn  amount)   | Interest rate  on issued  notes 1   |   Facility next   termination  date | Issued notes'  scheduled  maturity date   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Dated subordinated fixed-to-floating rate callable notes facility |          2015 | USD        |                           700 |                                  700 | 3.53%                                       | 5.75%                               |                                2025 | 2050                                      |\n| Dated subordinated fixed rate callable notes facility 4           |          2016 | USD        |                            23 |                                   23 | 3.92%                                       | 6.05%                               |                                2031 | 2056                                      |\n| Dated subordinated fixed-to-floating rate callable notes facility |          2016 | USD        |                           800 |                                  800 | 3.67%                                       | 5.625%                              |                                2027 | 2052                                      |\n| Perpetual subordinated fixed spread callable notes facility 4     |          2017 | USD        |                           454 |                                  454 | 2.73%                                       | 5.524%                              |                                2027 | Perpetual 2                               |\n\n| As of 31 December 2022                                            |   Issued   in | Currency   |   Nominal  value in  millions | Nominal value in  millions drawn   | Commitment fee  (paid on undrawn  amount)   | Interest rate  on issued  notes 1   | Facility first  termination  date   | Issued notes'  scheduled  maturity date   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|\n| Dated subordinated fixed-to-floating rate callable notes facility |          2015 | USD        |                           700 | 700                                | 3.53%                                       | 5.75%                               | 2025                                | 2050                                      |\n| Dated subordinated fixed rate callable notes facility             |          2016 | USD        |                           400 | 400                                | 3.92%                                       | 6.05%                               | 2031                                | 2056                                      |\n| Dated subordinated fixed-to-floating rate callable notes facility |          2016 | USD        |                           800 | 800                                | 3.67%                                       | 5.625%                              | 2027                                | 2052                                      |\n| Perpetual subordinated fixed spread callable notes facility       |          2017 | USD        |                           750 | -                                  | 2.73% 3                                     | 5.524% 3                            |                                     | 2022 Perpetual 2                          |\n\nIn 2015 and 2016, the Company entered into subordinated funding facilities with its subsidiary Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd under which Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd has the right, among others, to issue subordinated notes to the Company at any time.\n\nUntil 10 May 2022, the facilities were undrawn and for its various rights, Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd owed the Company an unconditional fixed commitment fee on the total facility amount, payable in annual instalments. Annually, Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd received a partial reimbursement of the commitment fee on the undrawn facility amount.\n\nOn 11 May 2022, the facilities were fully drawn and turned into subordinated loans. Therefore, the commitment fee and the related reimbursement ceased on the drawdown date and in return, the Company received an annual interest payment from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd.\n\nOn 7 December 2023, the subordinated funding facilities with Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd were terminated.\n\nThe following table provides an overview of the subordinated funding facilities as of 31 December  2022:\n\nNominal\n\n| As of 31 December 2022        | Borrower                      |   Issued  in | Currency   | Nominal  value in  millions value in  millions  drawn   | Total commitment  fee on nominal  value   | Reimbursement  fee on undrawn  amount   | Net commitment  fee on undrawn   |   amount Maturity |\n|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Subordinated funding facility | Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd |         2015 | USD        | 700 700                                                 | 5.80%                                     | 2.22%                                   | 3.58%                            |              2030 |\n| Subordinated funding facility | Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd |         2016 | USD        | 400 400                                                 | 6.10%                                     | 2.13%                                   | 3.97%                            |              2036 |\n| Subordinated funding facility | Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd |         2016 | USD        | 800 800                                                 | 5.68%                                     | 1.95%                                   | 3.73%                            |              2032 |",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILAITED COMPANIES\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Company has recorded investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies of CHF 18 471 million and a valuation adjustment on these investments of CHF 88.5 million as of 31 December 2023. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised at acquisition cost or, in the case of expected permanent impairment, at the lower fair value. The investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are not listed on an active market. The company determines the fair value of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, representing the difference between the fair value of\n\nassets and liabilities, using the internal established valuation method.\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the impairment assessment of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We performed a risk assessment to determine the amount of the headroom which would give us the scope of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies with a higher risk on recoverability. For these investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies we performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method used against recognised accounting methods and Swiss Law.\n\nKPMG AG Zurich, 12 March 2024",

Depending on the amount of the headroom between the book value and the determined fair value, the recoverability represents a higher risk.\n\nThe applied valuation method for the valuation of certain assets and liabilities uses assumptions which are partially based on internal estimate and therefore require subjectivity and judgment.\n\nThe impairment assessment for investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies has been designated as a key audit matter given an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialized skills and knowledge, due to the valuation method used and estimate uncertainty associated with the assumptions.\n\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the client's fair value by using an alternative valuation method.\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the accuracy of the valuation allowance by comparing the valuation allowance calculated and the booked amount.\n\nWe involved our valuation specialists who supported the audit team in:\n\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the valuation methodologies in light of market knowledge and experience.\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the assumptions which have been used for the purpose of the impairment test.\n\nFor the investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies with reinsurance or corporate solutions business, we involved our actuarial specialists who supported the audit team in:\n\n- \uf8e7 Performing a comparison of the used actuarial methods, models and assumptions across the liabilities for life and health policy benefits reserves between the internal valuation method and Swiss law.\n- \uf8e7 Challenging the applied discount rates for unpaid claims by comparing to external market information.\n\nFor further information on impairment assessment of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies refer to the following:\n\n- -  Note 1\n- -  Note 2\n\n- -  Note 6\n\n## Other Information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

        "page_content": "## Note on risk factors\n\nThe operations, investments and other activities of Swiss Re Ltd ('SRL') and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Swiss Re') are subject to a range of risks that could adversely impact the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## General impact of adverse market conditions\n\nSwiss Re's operations as well as its investment returns are subject to conditions in the financial markets and macroeconomic factors. Financial, credit and foreign exchange markets are experiencing continued periods of volatility reflecting a range of political, geopolitical, economic and other uncertainties, some of the more significant of which are inter-related, including inflation.\n\nFor example, in case of a claims occurrence, higher inflation may lead to higher replacement costs than anticipated. In Property & Casualty Reinsurance, due to inflation and supply chain issues, costs to rebuild and repair structures have significantly increased; respectively in Life & Health Reinsurance, potential increases in excess mortality and higher medical costs caused by residual impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, such as longCOVID or delayed medical care, may, as a result, represent a risk that Swiss Re's reserves may not be adequate to address such claims in the future.\n\nFurther adverse developments or the continuation of adverse trends that, in turn, have a negative impact on financial markets and economic conditions, could limit the Group's ability to access the capital markets and bank funding markets, could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to meet their obligations to the Group and could adversely affect the confidence of the ultimate buyers of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nAny of the foregoing factors, developments and trends could have a material adverse effect on the Group's investment and overall results, make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in the Group's portfolio, make it more difficult to acquire suitable investments to meet its risk and return criteria and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## Impact of the military conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical tensions\n\nThe ongoing military conflict in Ukraine as well as in the Middle East, sanctions, and other potential impacts on the global economic environment and currencies may cause demand for the Group's products to be volatile (particularly in Europe), cause abrupt changes in the Group's customers' buying patterns, result in higher than usual re/insurance claims (including in relation to aviation, marine and business interruption re/insurance claims), interrupt the Group's ability to supply products to these regions or to fulfil contractual obligations or limit customers' access to financial resources, which may impact such customers' ability to satisfy obligations to the Group. Events that may arise from or relating to geopolitical tensions, which may consist of conflicts arising in and between, or otherwise impacting, countries that are operationally and/or financially material to the Group or significant elections that may result in domestic and/or regional political tensions, may adversely impact the global economy and supply chain, banking and monetary systems, markets or customers of Swiss Re's products, including as a result of the enactment of associated governmental and other measures such as sanctions (which may include seizures, nationalisation or expropriations) or as a result of public or political pressure. Such events could adversely affect Swiss Re's results or operations.",

Furthermore, Swiss Re may suffer from reputational damage and/or litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could result in its financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected. In addition, changes and uncertainty in relation to policies or regulations regarding sustainability, ESG or CSR matters as well as the fragmentation of ESG legislation globally, may result in potential investigation and litigation, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased capital expenditures, which could result in Swiss Re's financial condition being materially and adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Swiss Re's investors, shareholders, business partners and third parties look to ESG rating systems, or disclosure frameworks that have been developed by third party groups to allow comparisons between companies on ESG factors as they evaluate investment decisions as well as company disclosures. Swiss Re does not participate in all of the available rating systems and may not necessarily score well in all of the available ratings systems. Further, the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently, and Swiss Re cannot guarantee that it will be able to score well as criteria change. Failure to participate in certain third-party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational damage, which could result in Swiss Re's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected.",

Such issues have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Group's business by either requiring it to extend coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or amounts of claims against the Group. For example, the trend of social inflation has increased liability claims against the Group in recent years. There has been an increase in severity of awards and settlements affecting excess and umbrella layers, particularly in the US, as well as an increase in commercial automotive and general liability claims. The Group has continued to pro-actively strengthen its reserves and has considered the latest information and outlook related to such claims, including in relation to economic and social inflation when making its reserve decisions. In addition, the Group closely monitors the intersection between social inflation, economic inflation and loss trend and intends to adjust its pricing accordingly. The Group intends to continue to manage its exposure to large corporate risks in line with its cautious view on social inflation. Despite the Group's various measures to address these issues, there remains uncertainty on how these unintended issues related to claims and coverage may impact the Group's business. If the Group's reserving and pricing is not adequate to cover these or other issues, there could be an additional adverse effect for the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\n## Insurance, operational and other risks\n\nAs part of the Group's ordinary course of operations, the Group is subject to a variety of risks, including risks that reserves may not adequately cover future claims and benefits; risks that catastrophic events (including natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, windstorms, hail storms, wildfires, floods and earthquakes, as well as extreme space weather events such as solar storms and geomagnetic activity, and man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism, cyberattacks and other disasters such as explosions, industrial accidents and fires, as well as diseases, pandemics, epidemics and humanitarian crises) are inherently unpredictable in terms of both their frequency and severity (as well as heightened accumulation risk e.g. in the case of cyberattacks) and have exposed, and may continue to expose, the Group to unexpected large losses (and related uncertainties in estimating future claims in respect of such events); changes in the insurance industry that affect ceding companies, particularly those that further increase their sensitivity to counterparty risk; competitive conditions (including as a result of consolidation and the availability of significant levels of alternative capacity); cyclicality of the industry; risks related to emerging claims and coverage issues (including, in particular, social inflation); macro developments giving rise to emerging risks, such as climate change and technological developments (including greater exposure to cyber risks, where accumulation risk is yet to be fully understood, which could have a range of consequences from operational disruption, to loss of proprietary or customer data, to greater regulatory burdens and potential liability); risks arising from the Group's dependence on policies, procedures and expertise of ceding companies; risks related to investments and operations in emerging markets; and risks related to the failure of, or attacks directed at, the Group's operational systems and infrastructure (or those of its third party providers), including systems and infrastructure relating to IT, data storage and processing as well as accounting and control. Any of the foregoing, as well as the occurrence of future risks that the Group's risk management procedures fail to identify or anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on the Group, and could also give rise to reputational risk.",

        "page_content": "## Financial and capital market risk\n\nVolatility and disruption in the global financial markets could expose the Group to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate prices and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely impact the Group's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital position. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk is primarily related to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. In general, a higher interest rate environment is beneficial to the insurance and reinsurance industries, supporting earnings capacity via higher investment income, despite mark-to-market volatility in short term. Additionally, an increase in interest rates generally results in an increase in the Group's Swiss Solvency Test ratio. Exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. When credit spreads widen, the net unrealised loss position of the Group's investment portfolio can increase, as could other-than-temporary impairments.\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices, as well as the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular equity security, a basket of equity securities or a stock index. The Group is also subject to equity price risk to the extent that the values of life-related benefits under certain products and life contracts, most notably variable annuity contracts, are wholly or partially exposed, directly and/or indirectly, to market fluctuations, including equity prices. To the extent market values fall, the financial exposure on guarantees related to these contracts would increase to the extent this exposure is not hedged. While the Group has an extensive hedging programme covering its existing variable annuity business, certain risks cannot be hedged, including actuarial, basis and correlation risks. Exposure to real estate originates from changes in property values. Foreign exchange risk arises from changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency exchange rates.\n\nThe Group seeks to manage the risks inherent in its investment portfolio by repositioning the portfolio from time to time, as needed, and to reduce risk and fluctuations through the use of hedges and other risk management tools. These risks can have a significant effect on investment returns and market values of securities positions, which in turn may affect both the Group's results of operations and financial condition. The Group continues to focus on asset-liability management for its investment portfolio, but pursuing even this strategy has its risks, including a possible mismatch between investments and liability benchmarks.",

        "page_content": "## Legal, regulatory and tax risks\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which determine the Group's rights and obligations under insurance, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. From time to time, the Group may institute, or be named as a defendant in, legal proceedings, and the Group may be a claimant or respondent in arbitration proceedings. These proceedings could involve coverage or other disputes with ceding companies, disputes with parties to which the Group transfers risk under reinsurance arrangements, disputes with other counterparties or other matters. The Group cannot predict the outcome of any of the foregoing, which could be material for the Group.\n\nIn the future, the Group could be involved in investigations and regulatory proceedings, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines and other outcomes. These investigations and proceedings could relate to insurance or reinsurance matters, or could involve broader business conduct rules, including those in respect of market abuse, bribery, money laundering, sanctions, competition law, data protection and privacy or ESG, CSR or sustainability issues more generally as well as any other disclosure or accounting issues. The Group also is subject to audits and challenges from time to time by tax authorities, which could result in increases in tax costs, changes to internal structures and interest and penalties. Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws. The Group could be subject to risks arising from alleged, or actual, violations of any of the foregoing, and could also be subject to litigation or enforcement actions arising from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with internal policies and procedures, negligence and malfeasance, such as undertaking or facilitating cyber-attacks on internal systems. Substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause significant reputational harm, which could seriously affect its business.\n\n## Changes in the legal, regulatory or tax environment\n\nSwiss Re and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment, which continues to change over time. The regulatory regimes to which members of the Group are subject have changed significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to evolve. While most regulation is national in scope, the global nature of the Group's business means that its operations are subject to a patchwork of global, national and regional standards. Swiss Re and its subsidiaries are subject to group supervision and Swiss Re's subsidiaries are also subject to applicable regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, particularly Switzerland, the United States, Luxembourg and Singapore. Swiss Re, as well as its Swiss-regulated entities, is subject to the Swiss Solvency Test and, through its legal entities and branches organised in the European Economic Area, Solvency II.\n\nIn Switzerland, where, among other operating and non-operating legal entities, Swiss Re's holding SRL and ultimate operating legal entity Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd are located, the partial revision of the Swiss Insurance Supervision Act and Swiss Insurance Supervision Ordinance entered into force on 1 January 2024. The revision includes various changes, some of which may lead to higher compliance and legal costs, the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs as well as the risk of losing business due to the new regulation on (re)insurance intermediaries. As a result of the partial revision of the Swiss Insurance Supervision Act and Swiss Insurance Supervision Ordinance, FINMA is revising the downstream regulation with the changes expected to enter into force on 1 September 2024.\n\nWhile certain regulatory processes are designed in part to foster convergence and achieve recognition of group supervisory schemes, the Group continues to face risks of extraterritorial application of regulations, particularly as to group supervision and group solvency requirements. In addition, regulators in jurisdictions beyond those where the Group has core operations increasingly are playing a greater oversight role, requiring more localised",

        "page_content": "resources and, despite a predominantly local focus, also raise issues of a cross border nature. Furthermore, evolving regulatory schemes and requirements may be inconsistent or may conflict with each other, thereby subjecting the Group, particularly in light of the increasing focus on legal entities in isolation and fragmented jurisdictional approaches to ESG supervision for example, to higher compliance and legal costs and risks, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs.\n\nIn December 2022, the Financial Stability Board ('FSB') endorsed the International Association of Insurance Supervisors' ('IAIS') Holistic Framework ('HF') for assessing and mitigating systemic risk and discontinued its identification of global systemically important insurers ('G-SIIs'). However, discussions on the identification of domestic systemically important insurers ('D-SIIs') are still ongoing in certain jurisdictions. The IAIS HF embraces an enhanced set of policy measures targeted at the exposures and activities that can lead to systemic risks from the insurance sector. The Group cannot predict what additional regulatory changes will be implemented as the IAIS systemic risk process evolves and what any such changes may mean for how the Group is structured in any particular jurisdiction and how aspects of its business may be affected.\n\nLarge internationally active insurance groups ('IAIGs'), which are identified by group-wide supervisors based on IAIS defined criteria, are expected to become subject to a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard ('ICS'). ICS Version 2.0 was adopted in November 2019 for a five-year confidential reporting period during which time no supervisory action will be taken on the basis of the monitoring. A revised Candidate ICS as a Prescribed Capital Requirement ('PCR') version of the ICS was consulted on during 2023 with a planned adoption at year-end 2024 ahead of becoming a PCR in 2025. In November 2019, the IAIS also adopted the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ('ComFrame'), as well as some changes to a number of Insurance Core Principles ('ICPs') - principles and standards on supervision of insurers which apply to insurance companies regardless of size and international exposures. ComFrame strengthens ICP requirements for IAIGs and, inter alia, proposes that the group-wide supervisor, in consultation with the host supervisors, should exercise discretion in requiring IAIGs to submit recovery plans. Swiss Re has been classified as an IAIG.\n\nThe Group can neither predict which legislative and/or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or promulgated, nor their scope and content, their date of enactment or their implications for the industry, in general, and for the Group, in particular. The Group may be subject to changes in views of its supervisors in respect of the models that the Group uses for capital and solvency purposes, and could be adversely affected if, for example, it is required to use standard models rather than internal models. Generally, legal and regulatory changes could have a material impact on the Group's business.\n\nRegulatory changes also could occur in areas of broader application, such as competition policy and tax laws. For example, changes in tax laws, or the interpretation of the tax laws or tax regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group does business, or withdrawals of tax rulings in jurisdictions such as Switzerland that have issued such rulings to Swiss Re, could increase the level of taxes the Group pays, or impact the attractiveness of products offered by the Group, the Group's investment activities or the value of deferred tax assets. These changes, or inconsistencies between the various regimes that apply to the Group, could increase the costs of doing business (including due to increased capital requirements), reduce access to liquidity, limit the scope of current or future business or affect the competitive balance, or could make reinsurance less attractive to primary insurers. In 2023, some countries, including Switzerland, introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS), a minimum tax scheme related to the OECD initiative to get to a worldwide minimum taxation of 15% (and other countries are expected to follow in 2024. The rules will impact the overall tax payments of the Group and will significantly increase Swiss Re's tax compliance cost.",

        "page_content": "## Risks relating to credit rating downgrades\n\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of (re)insurance companies. Third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of (re) insurers, such as Swiss Re. These ratings are intended to measure a company's ability to repay its obligations and are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies. Ratings may be solicited or unsolicited.\n\nThe Group's solicited ratings reflect the current opinion of the rating agencies with whom we maintain an interactive rating relationship for the purpose of solicited ratings. One or more of the Group's ratings could be downgraded or withdrawn in the future, or the Group may decide to give up such rating voluntarily. In addition, unsolicited ratings may also be downgraded or withdrawn, such as the downgrade in April 2020 of unsolicited insurer financial strength and long-term issuer default ratings assigned to various entities within the Group. Rating agencies may, in their sole discretion, increase the frequency and scope of ratings reviews, revise their criteria or take other actions that may negatively impact the Group's ratings and/or the ratings of its legal entities, which it cannot predict. In addition, changes to the process or methodology of issuing ratings, changes in regulation, or the occurrence of events or developments affecting the Group, could adversely affect the Group's existing ratings or make it more difficult for the Group to achieve improved ratings which it would otherwise have expected. In particular, it is possible that the Group's ratings could be negatively affected by a range of factors such as challenging market environment, the level of natural catastrophe losses, underwriting performance, adequacy of reserves, changes in senior management, economic trends and financial market performance on the Group. Any of the foregoing, or a combination of the foregoing, could have a negative impact on the Group's business.\n\nAs financial strength ratings are a key factor in establishing the competitive position of (re) insurers, a decline in ratings of Swiss Re and/or the ratings of its key rated legal entities could make (re)insurance provided by the Group less attractive to clients relative to (re) insurance from competitors with similar or stronger ratings. A decline in ratings could also cause the loss of clients who are required by either policy or regulation to purchase (re) insurance only from (re)insurers with certain ratings, or whose confidence in the Group is otherwise diminished. Certain larger (re)insurance and derivative contracts may contain terms that would allow the ceding companies or counterparties to terminate the contract if the Group's ratings or those of its subsidiaries are downgraded beyond a certain threshold. Furthermore, ratings directly impact the availability and terms of unsecured financing (potentially impacting both the Group's ability to rollover existing facilities and/or obtain new facilities) and declines in the Group's ratings or the ratings of legal entities within the Group could also obligate the Group to provide collateral or other guarantees in the course of its business or trigger early termination of funding and/or derivative arrangements. As a ratings decline could also have a material adverse impact on the Group's costs of borrowing or ability to access the capital markets, the adverse implications of a downgrade could be more severe.\n\n## Coronavirus\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus and the disease it causes ('COVID-19'), and the actions taken to slow the spread of the pandemic, have had an adverse impact on communities, social and business interactions, economic activities and economies across the globe, particularly during the 2020-2022 period, with the global insurance industry facing adverse claims for additional healthcare costs and higher mortality rates, as well as pandemic-related litigation in a number of jurisdictions. Although, increased global vaccination rates and effective implementation of control measures, the economic and insurance industry impact of COVID-19 and its consequences have been largely mitigated, new developments, such as new strains of the virus which risk becoming vaccine-resistant, consequences brought by long-COVID 19, recurring spreads of COVID-19 or lockdown measures, could pose threats to the global economy.",

For example, the Group estimates premiums pending receipt of actual data from ceding companies, which actual data could deviate from the estimates (and could be adversely affected if premiums turn out to be lower, while claims stay the same). In addition, particularly with respect to catastrophic events, it may be difficult to estimate losses, and preliminary estimates may be subject to a high degree of uncertainty and change as new information becomes available. Deterioration in market conditions could have an adverse impact on assumptions used for financial reporting purposes, which could trigger a potential impairment of various assets and liabilities, including goodwill. Moreover, regulators could require the use of standard models instead of permitting the use of internal models. To the extent that management's estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on underwriting results (in the case of risk models) or on reported financial condition or results of operations (in the case of accounting judgments), and such impact could be material.\n\nThe Group's results may be impacted by changes in accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of accounting standards. Changes in accounting standards could impact future reported results or require restatement of past reported results. The Group's results may also be impacted if regulatory authorities take issue with any conclusions the Group may reach in respect of accounting matters. This applies to the financial reporting under US GAAP until end of 2023 and under IFRS from 2024 onwards. Our adoption of IFRS for the Group's consolidated accounts may also result in additional complexity in our financial reporting, including the publication of financial information, or other unexpected impacts.\n\nThe Group uses non-GAAP financial measures in its external financial reporting. These measures are not prepared in accordance with US GAAP or any other comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Moreover, these may be different from, or otherwise inconsistent with, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited.\n\nIn its 2023 annual report, the Group included a separate section in respect of its results, including financial information, prepared in accordance with the Group's proprietary economic value management ('EVM') principles ('EVM section'). Financial information included in the EVM section contains non-GAAP financial measures. The EVM principles differ significantly from US GAAP and, accordingly, the Group's results prepared in accordance with US GAAP will differ from its EVM results, and those differences could be material. The Group's annual EVM results can be more volatile than the US GAAP results because, among others, assets and liabilities are measured on a market consistent basis, profit recognition on new contracts is recognised at inception rather than over the lifetime of the contract, and life and health actuarial assumptions are on a best estimate basis as opposed to generally being locked-in. The Group's EVM financial information should not be viewed as a substitute for the Group's US GAAP financial statements. In respect of the financial year starting 1 January 2024 and thereafter, Swiss Re Group will no longer report EVM results.",

Changes in the market value of the underlying securities and other factors impacting their price could give rise to market value losses. The Group could also face write-downs in other areas of its portfolio, including other structured instruments, and the Group and its counterparties could face difficulties in valuing credit-related instruments. Differences in opinion with respect to valuations of credit-related instruments could result in legal disputes among the Group and its counterparties as to their respective obligations, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict and could be material. The Group is also subject to credit and other risks in its credit business, including reliance on banks that underwrite and monitor facilities in which the Group participates and potential default by borrowers under those facilities.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nThe Group's business requires, and its clients expect, that it has sufficient capital and sufficient liquidity to meet its (re)insurance obligations, and that this would continue to be the case following the occurrence of any foreseeable event or series of events, including extreme catastrophes, that would trigger insurance or reinsurance coverage obligations. The Group's uses of funds include, among other things, payment of its obligations arising in its insurance and reinsurance businesses (including claims and other payments as well as insurance provision repayments due to portfolio transfers, securitisations and commutations), which may include large and unpredictable claims (including catastrophe claims), funding of capital requirements and operating costs, payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and funding of acquisitions. The Group also has unfunded capital commitments in its private equity and hedge fund investments, which could result in funding obligations at a time when it is subject to liquidity constraints. In addition, the Group has potential collateral requirements in connection with a number of reinsurance arrangements, the amounts of which may be material and the meeting of which could require the Group to liquidate cash equivalents or other securities.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity and funding risks by focusing on the liquidity stress that is likely to result from extreme capital markets scenarios or from extreme loss events or combinations of the two. Generally, the ability to meet liquidity needs could be adversely impacted by factors that the Group cannot control, such as market dislocations or interruptions, adverse economic conditions, severe disruption in the financial and worldwide credit markets and the related increased constraints on the availability of credit; changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads; or by perceptions among market participants of the extent of the Group's liquidity needs.\n\nUnexpected liquidity needs (including to meet collateral calls) could require the Group to increase levels of indebtedness or to liquidate investments or other assets. Should the Group require liquidity at a time when access to bank funding and the capital markets is limited, it may be unable to secure new sources of funding. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through asset sales may be constrained by market conditions and the related stress on valuations. In addition, the Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through the incurrence of debt may be limited by constraints on the general availability of credit in the case of bank funding, and adverse market conditions, in the case of capital markets debt. Failure to meet covenants in lending arrangements could further constrain access to liquidity. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs may also be constrained by regulatory requirements that require regulated entities to maintain or increase regulatory capital, or that restrict intragroup transactions, the timing of dividend payments from subsidiaries or the fact that certain assets may be encumbered or are otherwise not tradeable. Finally, any adverse ratings action against the Group could trigger a need for further liquidity (for example, by triggering termination provisions or margin calls/collateral delivery requirements in contracts to which Swiss Re is a party) at a time when the Group's ability to obtain liquidity from external sources is limited by such ratings action.
