Apart from the foregoing, Nestl\u00e9 S.A. is not aware of any other shareholder holding, as at December 31, 2023, Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares in excess of 3% of the share capital.\n\nDuring 2023, the Company published on the electronic publication platform of the SIX Swiss Exchange two disclosure notifications pertaining to the holding of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares by Norges Bank Oslo, and two disclosure notifications concerning the holding of its own shares. The details of these disclosure notifications can be accessed on the publication platform of the SIX Swiss Exchange following this link: www.ser-ag.com/en/resources/notifications-marketparticipants/significant-shareholders.html#.\n\nWith respect to nominees, Citibank N.A., London, as depositary for the shares represented by  American Depositary Receipts, was the registered holder of 180 343 318 shares, i.e. 6.75% of the shares of the Company as at December 31, 2023. At the same date, Nortrust Nominees Ltd., London, was a registered Nominee N of 96 514 429 shares of the Company, representing 3.62% of the shares.\n\n## 1.3 Cross-shareholdings\n\nThe Company is not aware of cross-shareholdings exceeding 5% of the capital or voting rights on both sides.\n\n## Capital structure\n\n## 2. Capital structure\n\n## 2.1 Capital\n\nThe ordinary share capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. is CHF 267 000 000. The conditional share capital is CHF 10 000 000. Nestl\u00e9 S.A. does not have any authorized share capital.\n\n## 2.2 Conditional capital\n\nThe share capital may be increased (without time limitation) in an amount not to exceed CHF 10 000 000 by issuing up to 100 000 000  registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each (representing 3.75% of the currently issued share capital) through the exercise of conversion rights and/or option rights granted in connection with the issuance by Nestl\u00e9 or one of its subsidiaries of newly or already issued convertible debentures, debentures with option rights or other financial market instruments. Thus, the Board of Directors has at its disposal a flexible instrument enabling it, if necessary, to finance the activities of the Company through convertible debentures.\n\nFor a description of the group of beneficiaries and of the terms and conditions of the issuance of conditional capital, refer to art. 3 bis of the Articles of Association of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. ( * )\n\n## 2.3 Changes in capital\n\nThe share capital was reduced three times in the last three financial years as a consequence of two share buyback programs: a share buyback program of up to CHF 20 billion, launched on January 3, 2020, and terminated on December 30, 2021, and the ongoing share buyback program of up to CHF 20 billion, launched on January 3, 2022, and due to be completed by the end of December 2024. The resulting cancellations of shares were approved at the 2021, 2022 and 2023 Annual General Meetings.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the Annual General Meeting resolved to cancel 66 000 000 shares, leading to a reduction of the share capital to CHF 281 500 000.\n\nOn April 7, 2022, the Annual General Meeting resolved to cancel 65 000 000 shares, leading to a reduction of the share capital to CHF 275 000 000.\n\nOn April 20, 2023, the Annual General Meeting resolved to cancel 80 000 000 shares, leading to a reduction of the share capital to the present CHF 267 000 000.",

The number of registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each, fully paid up, was 2 670 000 000 as at December 31, 2023.\n\nAccording to art. 11 par. 1 of the Articles of Association, each share recorded in the share register as share with voting rights confers one vote on its holder. See also point 2.6.1 below.\n\nShareholders have the right to receive dividends. There are no participation certificates.\n\n## 2.5 Dividend-right certificates\n\nThere are no dividend-right certificates.\n\n## 2.6 Limitations on transferability and nominee registrations\n\n2.6.1.  Limitations on transferability along with an indication of group clauses in the Articles of Association and rules for granting exceptions\n\nAccording to art. 5 par. 5 of the Articles of Association, no person or entity shall be registered with voting rights for more than 5% of the share capital as recorded in the commercial register. This limitation on registration also applies to persons who hold some or all of their shares through nominees pursuant to that article. Legal entities that are linked to one another through capital, voting rights, management or in any other manner, as well as all natural persons or legal entities achieving an understanding or forming a syndicate or otherwise acting in concert to circumvent the regulations concerning the limitation on registration or the nominees, shall be counted as one person or nominee (art. 5 par. 7 of the Articles of Association). The limitation on registration also applies to shares acquired or subscribed by the exercise of subscription, option or conversion rights (art. 5 par. 10 of the Articles of Association). See also art. 5 par. 6 and par. 9 of the Articles of Association and point 2.6.3 below.\n\n2.6.2. Reasons for granting exceptions in the year under review\n\nPlease refer to points 2.6.3 and 6.1.3 below.\n\n## 2.6.3. Admissibility of nominee registrations, indication of percent clauses and registration conditions\n\nPursuant to art. 5 par. 6 and par. 9 of the Articles of Association, the Board of Directors has issued regulations concerning the application of art. 5 of the Articles of Association. The regulations on nominees set forth rules for the entry of nominees as shareholders in the share register.\n\nThey allow the registration of:\n\n- -Nominees N ('N' as Name of beneficial owner disclosed): where trading and safekeeping practices make individual registration of beneficial owners di/fficult or impractical, shareholders may register their holdings through a Nominee N with voting rights, subject to the specific understanding that the identity and holdings of beneficial owners are to be disclosed to the Company, periodically or upon request. Voting rights of Nominees N are to be exercised on the basis of voting instructions received from the beneficial owners. For voting purposes, holdings of a Nominee N, or Nominees N acting as an organized group or pursuant to a common agreement, may not exceed 5% of the share capital of the Company. Holdings exceeding the 5% limit (respectively the limit fixed by the Board of Directors, see point 6.1.3 below) are registered without voting rights. The responsibility for disclosure of beneficial owners and their holdings resides with the nominees registered in the share register.\n- -Nominees A ('A' as Anonymous beneficial owner): registration without voting rights.\n\nIn line with its regulations, in order to facilitate trading of the shares on the Stock Exchange, the Board of Directors has authorized certain nominees to exceed the 5% limit to be registered as nominees with voting rights.\n\n2.6.4. Procedure and conditions for cancelling statutory privileges and limitations on transferability\n\nPlease refer to point 6.1.3 below.\n\n## 2.7 Convertible bonds and options\n\nAs at December 31, 2023, there are no outstanding convertible bonds or warrants/options issued by Nestl\u00e9 S.A. or by subsidiaries on Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares.",

This ensures an appropriate cognitive diversity and supports the continuous succession planning for the Board as a whole and for its various Committees.\n\nThe Nomination Committee periodically reviews the composition of the Board using various criteria, including, without limitation:\n\n- -the Board's cumulative experience and expertise in (international) business leadership, legal/compliance/risk management, science, finance, marketing, IT, technology, government/politics, sustainability and other relevant fields;\n- -diversity of competencies including education, function, industry and geographic business experience;\n- -the Board's diversity of personal attributes including gender, age, ethnicity, nationality, culture and leadership approach;\n- -the Board's general age and term limits.\n\nThe Board should at all times be composed of:\n\n- -a majority of independent members; and\n- -members with the specific abilities or skills to serve on one or more of the various Board Committees.\n\n## 3.1.1.  Management tasks of the members of the Board of Directors\n\nWith the exception of Ulf Mark Schneider, all members of the Board of Directors are non-executive members. Paul Bulcke is active Chairman and has certain responsibilities for the direction and control of the Group with respect to Nestl\u00e9 Health Science and Nestl\u00e9's engagement with L'Or\u00e9al.\n\n## 3.1.2.  Information on non-executive members of the Board of Directors\n\nWith the exception of Paul Bulcke, all non-executive members of the Board of Directors are  independent, were not previously members of the Nestl\u00e9 management and have no important business connections with Nestl\u00e9.\n\nPursuant to Nestl\u00e9 S.A.'s Board Regulations (a) , a Director shall be considered independent if he/she is not and has not been employed as an executive o/fficer at the  Company or any of its principal subsidiaries or as employee or a/ffiliate of the Group's external auditor for the past three years and does not maintain, in the sole determination of the Board, a material direct or indirect business relationship with the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Directors with immediate family members who would not qualify as  independent shall not be considered independent, subject to a three-year cooling-o/ff period.\n\nNestl\u00e9's succession planning process is highly structured and managed by the Board's Nomination Committee with the support of outside consultants when necessary.\n\nSubject to specific exceptions granted by the Board, members are subject to twelve-year term limits. According to Nestl\u00e9 S.A.'s Board Regulations (a) , an age limit of 72 years applies. This allows for continuous refreshment and longterm succession planning according to Nestl\u00e9's skills and diversity grid.\n\n3.1.3.  Cross-involvement\n\nNone.",

Work methods of the Board of Directors and its Committees\n\nThe Board meets as often as necessary, at least quarterly, and on notice by the Chair or by the person designated by him. In addition, the Board must be convened as soon as a Board member requests the Chair to call a meeting. All Committees provide a detailed report to the full Board at each meeting in a dedicated Chair's session. The Board regularly meets for in camera sessions (without CEO) and independent director meetings (without Chair and CEO).\n\nThe Board reserves at least one day per year to discuss the strategic long-term plan of the Company. In addition, every year, the Board visits one Nestl\u00e9 Market for three to five days (in 2023, Nestl\u00e9 in Mexico). During the pandemic, the Board met virtually or in hybrid meetings and additional ad hoc meetings and reports were introduced.\n\nThe average attendance at the Board meetings in 2023 was 99%. All Board meetings, with the exception of certain Chair's and in camera sessions, are attended by all members of the Executive Board. In addition, members of the Executive Board and senior management participate in Committee meetings, if appropriate, when a Committee discusses matters in relation to their respective responsibilities. The CEO may partially attend the meetings of the Audit Committee, the Nomination Committee, the Sustainability Committee and the Compensation Committee as an invited guest, except on matters where he may have a conflict of interest. Furthermore, both the external auditor and the Head of Nestl\u00e9 Internal Audit participate in the Audit Committee meetings except for regular in camera sessions. No external subject matter experts were invited to the Board and Committee meetings in 2023.\n\nThe Company performs annual self-evaluations of the Board and its Committees, including confidential, anonymous feedback and individual interviews. Findings are appropriately addressed. An open, transparent and critical board room culture forms the basis for the Board of Directors' annual review of its own performance and e/ffectiveness. The Board of Directors conducts the self-assessment on the basis of anonymous questionnaires which deal with the Board's composition, organization and processes, the Board's responsibilities governed by the Board Regulations as well as the focus areas and goals of the year under review. The topics are discussed and take-aways defined to be incorporated in the goals for the upcoming year. In addition, each Board Committee annually reviews the adequacy of its composition, organization and processes as well as the scope of its responsibilities, assesses its accomplishments and evaluates its performance. For example, the Board created a dedicated Sustainability Committee as a result of its self-assessment process.\n\n## 3.5.4. Lead Independent Director\n\nThe Lead Independent Director assumes the role of a prime intermediary between the Board and the Chair. He may convene and chair Board meetings and in camera sessions, where the Chair is not present. He serves as an advisor to the Chair and acts as an intermediary between the Chair, the Board and the Board's stakeholders. He chairs meetings of the independent directors to evaluate the performance of the Chair and the e/ffectiveness of the relationship between the Chair and the CEO.",

        "page_content": "## 3.6 Definition of areas of responsibility\n\nThe governing bodies have responsibilities as follows:\n\n## 3.6.1.  Board of Directors (1)\n\nThe Board of Directors is the ultimate governing body of the Company. It is responsible for the long-term strategy and the ultimate supervision of the Group. It oversees the Group's economic, social and environmental sustainability. The Board attends to all matters which are not reserved for the Annual General Meeting or another governance body of the Company by law, the Articles of Association or specific regulations issued by the Board of Directors.\n\nUnder Nestl\u00e9's governance model, the CEO (Administrateur d\u00e9l\u00e9gu\u00e9) is a full member of the Board of Directors, ensuring full alignment on its critical responsibilities and proper checks and balances between the Chair and CEO.\n\nThe Board has the following main duties:\n\n- a)  the ultimate direction of the Company, in particular the conduct, management and supervision of the business of the Company, and the provision of necessary directions;\n- b) the determination of the Company's organization;\n- c)  the determination of accounting and financial control principles, as well as the principles of financial planning;\n- d) the appointment and removal of any Vice Chair, the Committee members (except the members of the Compensation Committee) and their Chairs and members of the Executive Board;\n- e)  the ultimate supervision of the Chair and the members of the Executive Board, in particular with respect to their compliance with the law, the Articles of Association, the Board Regulations and instructions given from time to time by the Board;\n- f)  the preparation of the Annual Report, the Compensation Report, the Report on Non-Financial Matters as well as the General Meetings and execution of their resolutions;\n- g) the notification of the court in the event of overindebtedness;\n- h)  the discussion and approval of:\n- -the Group's long-term strategy and annual investment budget;\n- -major financial operations;\n- -any significant policy issue dealing with the Company's or the Group's general structure or with financial, commercial and industrial policy;\n- -the review of and decision on any report submitted to the Board;\n- -the Group's annual risk assessment; and\n- -the compensation proposals to the General Meeting.\n\n## 3.6.2. Executive Board\n\nThe Board of Directors delegates to the CEO, with the authorization to subdelegate, the power to manage the Company's and the Group's business, subject to law, the Articles of Association and the Board Regulations.\n\nThe CEO chairs the Executive Board and delegates to its members individually the powers necessary for carrying out their responsibilities, within the limits fixed in the Executive Board Regulations.\n\n## 3.7 Information and control instruments vis-\u00e0-vis the Executive Board\n\nThe Board of Directors is, at each of its meetings, informed on material matters involving the Company's and the Group's business. Except for regular in camera sessions, the members of the Executive Board attend the Board of Directors meetings and report on current developments, significant projects and events. Other members of management attend Board meetings to report on the areas of the business for which they are responsible. Each Board member is entitled to request and receive information from the CEO and from other members of the Executive Board. In preparation for each Board meeting, the Board is provided with an overview of business performance and consolidated financial information. In addition, regular written reports by the Executive Board are provided, including e.g. capital investment, risk, audit, compliance and strategy progress reports. The Chair and the CEO ensure the proper information flow between the Executive Board and the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Board pays a visit to a major Market every year, where it meets members of senior management. The Board visited the United States in 2018, the Swiss Market in 2019 and 2021, Nestl\u00e9 India in 2022 and Nestl\u00e9 Mexico in 2023.\n\nThe Chair receives the agenda, documents and minutes of the meetings of the Executive Board as well as of the Key Markets and senior management meetings. He has regular meetings with the CEO and may request information about any matters relating to the Company. He may examine reports, proposals and minutes of meetings of any functions or committees of the Corporate Center or the Markets or businesses.\n\n- -Corporate Governance Principles of the Company;",

It performs twice a year a review of the assets and liabilities management by the Company's treasury, pensions and insurance departments with the Chief Financial O/fficer and the Head of Treasury, Pensions & Insurance being present.\n\nThe Audit Committee reviews the financial performance and assesses the e/ffectiveness of the internal and external audit processes as well as the internal risk management organization and processes. It has oversight over the accuracy of the financial and non-financial reporting. It reviews reports on the Company's internal control, compliance and risk management processes. It has complete and unrestricted access to the Company's management, books and records and may obtain any information it requires from the appropriate services. Members of the Executive Board and other senior management, in particular the Heads of Group Accounting & Reporting, Internal Audit and Legal and Compliance, attend the Audit Committee meetings, except for certain in camera sessions.\n\nThe Nomination Committee leads the succession planning for the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Sustainability Committee reviews reports on measures that ensure the long-term sustainability of the Company in its economic, social and environmental dimension. It has oversight over the structure and content of the ESG/sustainability reporting and monitors the Company's performance against selected external sustainability indexes. It oversees the Company's response to climate change, its human rights program and human capital management. Members of management, in particular the CEO, the Heads of Public A/ffairs and of Legal and Compliance, may attend the meetings.\n\nThe Compensation Committee reviews the Company's compensation system and principles. The Head of Human Resources may attend the meetings, except when questions of compensation for Executive Board members are deliberated.\n\nAdditional information and control instruments include the external auditors, Ernst & Young Ltd, auditors of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and of the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Nestl\u00e9 Group, who conduct their audit in compliance with Swiss law and in accordance with Swiss Auditing Standards and International Standards on Auditing, and the Nestl\u00e9 Internal Audit function.\n\nNestl\u00e9 Internal Audit comprises an organization of one Center Team and eight regional units of auditors covering all the businesses (i.e., head o/ffices, factories, distribution\n\ncenters and business units) worldwide, completing audit assignments on the basis of the annual internal audit plan based on an independent risk assessment that is approved by the Audit Committee.\n\nThe role of Nestl\u00e9 Internal Audit is to enhance and protect organizational value by providing risk-based and objective assurance, advice and insight, contributing to the continuous improvement of the Company's risk management and control systems. Nestl\u00e9 Internal Audit assesses the reliability of financial and operational information, the e/ffectiveness of controls and processes for compliance with internal, legal, regulatory and statutory requirements. Findings are communicated in the form of an audit report, which is shared with management and the Audit Committee.\n\nThe Head of Nestl\u00e9 Internal Audit reports administratively to the Chief Financial O/fficer and has a functional reporting line to the Chair of the Audit Committee. He reports at all the Audit Committee meetings, has direct access to the Chair of the Audit Committee and regularly meets with him for interim updates. The Audit Committee regularly receives a report on the results of the internal auditors' work that is also provided to the Chair of the Board of Directors, Executive Board members and other stakeholders. It reviews and monitors management's responsiveness to internal audit findings and recommendations. In case of major findings, a follow-up audit is planned to ensure proper remediation.\n\nGroup Risk Management provides assistance to all corporate entities with regard to risk management. Group Risk Services provides assistance to all corporate entities with regard to loss prevention, claims handling and insurance. Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) is a process applied across the Group, designed to identify potential events that may a/ffect the Group's achievement of its strategic objectives and support the Group to ensure it acts in accordance with external regulations and internal policies. It supports Nestl\u00e9's management to raise risk awareness and to anticipate emerging risks, as well as the process of identifying appropriate mitigation actions.\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Group adopts a dual approach using 'TopDown' and 'Bottom-Up' assessments. The 'Top-Down' assessment occurs annually and focuses on the Group's global risks. A 'Bottom-Up' assessment occurs in parallel, resulting in the aggregation of individual assessments by all Markets, Regionally and Globally Managed Businesses.\n\nAdditionally, Nestl\u00e9 engages with external stakeholders to better understand the issues that are of most concern to them. For each issue, the materiality matrix (please refer to www.nestle.com/materiality) rates the degree of stakeholder concern and potential business impact.",

Major announcements, such as results of corporate activity and investor seminars, are accompanied by a presentation broadcast 'live' on the internet.\n\nFurthermore, Nestl\u00e9 has an active investor relations (IR) program. Throughout the year, IR engages with investors (current or prospective) and relevant sell-side analysts in virtual and in-person meetings, conference calls, roadshows, broker conferences, or other events. In certain cases, members of management might also participate in some meetings with the financial community, including group and one-to-one meetings. Topics of discussion may include recently announced financial results, recent corporate activity, or the longer-term strategy of the Group; they are not an occasion for the disclosure of new information which might encourage investment decisions. Specifically on governance topics, the Company engages in an active dialogue with investors through regular Chairman's Roundtables, surveys, and bilateral exchanges, which are reported to the Chair's and Corporate Governance Committee or the Board.\n\nThe Company uses its website (www.nestle.com/investors) to ensure rapid and equitable distribution of information. There are also links to non-financial information that may be of interest to investors, including areas such as the environment, sustainability, and news about brands and innovation. A corporate calendar of relevant dates is displayed on page 63 of the Annual Review 2023 and available on the IR events pages (www.nestle.com/investors/events).\n\nThe Nestl\u00e9 Investor Relations Department can be contacted via the following coordinates:\n\n## Contact\n\nInvestor Relations Nestl\u00e9\u00a0S.A., Avenue Nestl\u00e9 55 1800 Vevey (Switzerland) Tel.: +41 (0)21 924 35 09 E-mail: ir@nestle.com",

Among the various programs to support this ambition is a competitive remuneration policy. Nestl\u00e9 believes in a performance culture as well as good corporate governance and corporate social responsibility.\n\nTherefore, remuneration at Nestl\u00e9 is based on the following principles:\n\n- -pay for performance to support the Company's short-term and long-term objectives;\n- -compensation aligned with long-term Group strategy and shareholders' interests;\n- -coherence in our remuneration plans and levels throughout the Company;\n- -competitiveness versus external market comparisons;\n- -appropriate balance of fixed and variable remuneration and short-term and long-term rewards.\n\nThis Compensation Report shall be submitted to the advisory vote of the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting 2024.\n\nAt the 2023 Annual General Meeting, shareholders approved the total compensation budgets for the Board of Directors and the Executive Board with large majorities.\n\nTo ensure complete accountability, the shareholders will be able to retrospectively vote on the Compensation Report and payouts in a consultative vote.\n\n## Changes to compensation\n\nFor 2023, we have added an ESG-related KPI as a fourth performance metric in the Long-Term Incentive Plan for 20% of its grant value and increased the disclosure on the target achievements under our short- and long-term incentive plans.",

The Committee consists of the Chair, who is an independent and non-executive member of the Board. The other members shall be a minimum of three other non-executive members of the Board.\n\nThe members of the CC have been elected by the shareholders for one year. The Chair was appointed by the Board of Directors. On December 31, 2023, the composition of the CC is as follows:\n\n| Chair      | Members           |\n|------------|-------------------|\n| Pablo Isla | Patrick Aebischer |\n|            | Dick Boer         |\n|            | Dinesh Paliwal    |\n\nThe tasks and areas of responsibility of the CC are described on page 14 of the Corporate Governance Report 2023.\n\n- (*)  Nestl\u00e9 S.A.'s Articles of Association can be found on page 61 and at www.nestle.com/investors/corporate-governance/articles",

Members of the Board of Directors could be obligated to return benefits received from the Company to the extent that these are manifestly disproportionate to the performance rendered in return and to the Company's economic situation (including as a result of fraud or accounting misstatement).\n\n## Principles\n\nThe remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors is set to attract and retain highly qualified individuals to serve on the Board of Directors. The level of remuneration reflects the time and e/ffort required from the members in fulfilling their Board and Committee responsibilities. The pay structure (cash and blocked shares) is designed to ensure the Board's focus on the long-term success of the Company. There is no variable compensation for non-executive members of the Board of Directors, in order to ensure a proper level of independence.\n\nThe principal benchmark used to define Board remuneration is a selection of large Swiss Market Index (SMI) companies (b) , adjusted for the size of Nestl\u00e9. These figures are periodically reviewed against this benchmark.\n\n## Compensation 2023 for the members of the Board of Directors\n\nBoard membership fees and allowances\n\nWith the exception of the Chair and the CEO, each member of the Board of Directors receives a Board membership fee of CHF 280 000 and an Expense Allowance of CHF 15 000. These figures have remained unchanged since 2006.",

The total supplementary amount shall not exceed 40% of the aggregate amount of compensation of the Executive Board last approved by the General Meeting per compensation period (art. 21 ter of the Articles of Association).\n\n## Principles\n\nThe principles of compensation for members of the Executive Board are the following:\n\n## Pay for performance\n\nThe Total Direct Compensation for the members of the Executive Board includes a fixed portion (Annual Base Salary) and a variable portion (Short-Term Bonus and Long-Term Incentives). The fixed compensation takes into account individual performance. Variable compensation is determined based on collective and individual performance. These are intended to ensure a major part of executive rewards are contingent on achieving demanding performance goals.\n\n## Alignment with long-term company strategy and shareholder interests\n\nCompensation for members of the Executive Board is aligned with company strategy and shareholders' interests. The Short-Term Bonus payout is determined by the degree of achievement of a number of objectives aligned to annual business plans. Long-Term Incentives are provided in the form of share-based instruments, therefore ensuring alignment with shareholders' interests. In 2023, the main Long-Term Incentive instrument was the Performance Share Unit Plan (PSUP). PSUs have a vesting period of three years, with a further holding period of two years for Executive Board members, leading to a total restriction period of five years. Their alignment with shareholder interests is reinforced through payouts being tied to underlying Earnings per Share (EPS) growth, relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nCoherence in remuneration plans and levels throughout the Company\n\nThe Company aims to align remuneration plans across the Group and to ensure that compensation rewards are appropriate for the added responsibilities of positions held. This is reflected in the relative remuneration levels of the Executive Board.",

        "page_content": "Compensation to be internationally competitive by using selected benchmarks\n\nThe compensation packages for the members of the Executive Board need to be competitive in a dynamic international environment. Nestl\u00e9 targets its overall remuneration policy to be between the median and the 75th percentile of the selected external benchmarks (please refer to page 50). Whenever appropriate, the benchmark values are adjusted for the size of Nestl\u00e9. The market competitiveness of the compensation of the Executive Board is therefore periodically assessed using the services of Willis Towers Watson, a reputed international human capital and benefits consultancy.\n\nThe total compensation package consists of the following elements:\n\n## 1.  Base Salary\n\nThe Base Salary is the foundation of the total compensation. It reflects the experience, expertise and sustained performance of the Executive Board member, as well as taking into account external market competitiveness. It also serves as the basis for determining the Short-Term Bonus target levels and the allocation of Long-Term Incentives. The Base Salary is reviewed annually by the Compensation Committee. Criteria for adjustments are individual contribution and the level of competitiveness against the benchmarks.\n\n## 2.  Short-Term Bonus\n\nThe Short-Term Bonus is intended to reward results achieved against annual collective and individual objectives related to Nestl\u00e9's overall business strategy. The Short-Term Bonus is paid in cash and/or in Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares ( * ) , which are subject to a three-year blocking period.\n\n(*)\n\nor American Depositary Receipts\n\n## Governance\n\nPursuant to art. 21 quater of Nestl\u00e9 S.A.'s Articles of Association ( ** ) , variable compensation may comprise short-term compensation elements, and shall be subject to caps expressed as predetermined multipliers of the respective target levels.\n\nShort-term compensation elements are governed by performance metrics that take into account the performance of Nestl\u00e9 and/or parts thereof, targets in relation to the market, to other companies or to comparable benchmarks and/or individual targets, and achievement of which is generally measured based on a one-year period. The annual target level of the short-term compensation elements is determined as a percentage of the Base Salary; depending on achieved performance, the compensation may amount up to a pre-determined multiplier of target level.\n\nThe Board of Directors or, to the extent delegated to it, the Compensation Committee, determines performance metrics and target levels, and their achievement.",

        "page_content": "## Objectives 2023\n\nThe Short-Term Bonus (Annual Bonus) is based on a bonus target expressed in % of the Annual Base Salary.\n\nIn 2023, the following target levels were applicable\n\n- -CEO: 150%;\n- -Executive Vice President: 100%;\n- -Deputy Executive Vice President: 80%.\n\nFor the CEO and the CFO, 85% of the target is linked to performance against the Nestl\u00e9 Group objectives (see below) and 15% to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) objectives. For the other members of the Executive Board, at least 35% of the target is linked to business performance, to ensure accountability for Nestl\u00e9's results, for Function Heads, 50% is tied to functional objectives, 35% to Group performance and 15% to ESG objectives; for Zone or Business Heads, 60% is tied to business objectives they are directly responsible for, 25% to Group performance and 15% to ESG objectives.\n\nIn case an executive reaches all objectives in full, the bonus payout will correspond to the targeted level. If one or more objectives are not reached, the bonus is reduced. The bonus payout is capped at a maximum of 130% of the target. There is no guarantee for the payout of a minimum bonus.\n\nMembers of the Executive Board can elect to receive part or all of their Short-Term Bonus in Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares ( * ) . The CEO has to take a minimum of 50% in shares.\n\nThe number of shares granted is determined using the average market closing price of the last ten trading days of January 2024.\n\n## Group objectives\n\nEvery year, the Board of Directors defines a set of key quantitative operational objectives, which comprise the main elements in determining the annual Group performance for the following year. These are linked to measurable financial objectives. In 2023, their weighting was 60% Organic Growth and 40% Profitability (Underlying Trading Operating Profit margin).\n\nAdditional quantitative and qualitative objectives, set by the Board of Directors in line with Nestl\u00e9's strategy, are also used to determine the Nestl\u00e9 Group performance. This set of additional objectives reflects Nestl\u00e9's Creating Shared Value framework and includes the proportion of products with Nutrition, Health & Wellness benefits, market shares, capital expenditure, structural cost optimization, progress on digitalization, strengthening Nestl\u00e9's values and culture, and further progress on quality, safety, sustainability and compliance.\n\nThe above objectives are kept under review by the Board of Directors to ensure that they are aligned with Nestl\u00e9's business objectives and its strategic ambition.\n\n## Business and functional objectives\n\nBusiness and functional objectives are determined by the CEO for each member of the Executive Board. They are related to the individual area of responsibility and are of a financial or non-financial nature.\n\n## Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) objectives\n\nESG objectives (15% of the target) are set annually by the Compensation Committee and reflect selected performance measures from the Company's ESG/Sustainability agenda. For 2023, they relate to a/ffordable nutrition with micro nutrients, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, plastic packaging designed for recycling, reduction of water use in factories and management positions held by women. These five objectives are equally weighted at 3% each.",

Long-Term Incentives\n\nLong-Term Incentives are intended to reward sustained business success and overall shareholder value creation as well as to retain key senior management members.\n\n## Governance\n\nPursuant to art. 21 quater of Nestl\u00e9 S.A.'s Articles of Association ( * ) , variable compensation may comprise longterm compensation elements, and shall be subject to caps expressed as pre-determined multipliers of the respective target levels.\n\nLong-term compensation elements are governed by performance metrics that take into account strategic objectives of Nestl\u00e9, achievement of which is generally measured based on a multi-annual period. The annual target level of the long-term compensation elements is determined as a percentage of the Base Salary; depending on the achieved performance, the compensation may amount up to a pre-determined multiplier of the target level. Vesting periods, as determined by the Board of Directors or, to the extent delegated to it, the Compensation Committee, shall be at least three years. See further art. 21 quater par. 6 to par. 8 of the Articles of Association.\n\nThe Board of Directors or, to the extent delegated to it, the Compensation Committee determines performance metrics and target levels, and their achievement.\n\n## Target levels 2023\n\nIn 2023, members of Nestl\u00e9's Executive Board were eligible to receive Long-Term Incentives in the form of Performance Share Units under the Performance Share Unit Plan (PSUP). The grant value for Long-Term Incentives in 2023 was the following:\n\n- -CEO: 150% of the Annual Base Salary\n- -Executive Vice President and Deputy Executive Vice President: 100% of the Annual Base Salary\n\nThe PSUP provides units which entitle participants to receive Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares at the end of the three-year vesting period. These shares remain blocked for a further period of two years for Executive Board members.\n\nThe level at which PSUs vest is determined by the degree by which the four performance measures of the PSUP are met over the full three-year vesting period. These four criteria are:\n\n- -the growth of underlying Earnings per Share (EPS) in constant currencies;\n- -the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of the Nestl\u00e9 S.A. share in relation to the STOXX Global 1800 Food & Beverage Gross Return Index;\n- -the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and\n- -the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nGrowth of underlying Earnings per Share, Total Shareholder Return performance in relation to peers, Return on Invested Capital and reduction in greenhouse gas emission are commonly used measures to determine senior management long-term performance in the industry. Growth of underlying Earnings per Share will be weighted at 40%, Total Shareholder Return Performance, Return on Invested Capital and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at 20% respectively to determine the vesting level of the initial PSU award.\n\nAll four performance measures will be subject to Compensation Committee review in case of extraordinary events.\n\nThe PSUP covers the Executive Board, Senior Vice Presidents and selected Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents. A Restricted Stock Unit Plan (RSUP) applies to all other participants.",

Other Incentive Plans\n\nFor the Head of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science, the LTI target grant values are the same as mentioned above, but are split between PSUP (30% of grant value) and the specific Long-Term Incentive Plan of Nestl\u00e9 Health Science (70% of grant value). Nestl\u00e9 Health Science has a Phantom Share Unit Plan based on the long-term development of that business, with a vesting period of three years, and a value capped at two times the Unit price at grant.\n\nThe Head of Zone North America also participates in the Nestl\u00e9 US Short-Term and Long-Term Incentive Plans for 75% of his total grant value. The Nestl\u00e9 US Short-Term Incentive Plan is capped at 150% of target based on performance. The Nestl\u00e9 US Long-Term Incentive Plan, which has a target value of 250%, is a Phantom Share Unit Plan based on the long-term results of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. The vesting range of these US Performance Share Units (US PSUs) starts at 0% and is capped at 200% based on Nestl\u00e9's results against Earnings Per Share and Total Shareholder Return performance measures. US PSUs have a three-year vesting period and are cash settled following the third\n\nanniversary of the grant date. These terms reflect the dynamics in our largest market and are comparable to the terms applicable for employees in similar positions in the US.\n\n## 5.  Other benefits\n\nTypical elements are a car allowance, long-term service awards in line with Company policy as well as contributions towards health insurance premiums and periodical health checks as well as personal security services. Health insurance premiums of the Heads of Zone North America and Zone Greater China, the Chief Communications O/fficer and the Head of Operations are paid by the Company. They also receive a financial planning allowance. Those Executive Board members who have been transferred to Switzerland from other Nestl\u00e9 locations are eligible to receive benefits provided by Nestl\u00e9's expatriation policies. The Heads of Zone North America and Zone Greater China receive a housing allowance. The Head of Zone North America also receives certain additional benefits including contributions to life insurance and other benefits available to employees in similar positions in the US.\n\nLong-Term Incentives (PSUP) ( ** ) 150%",

Pension benefits\n\nExecutive Board members are a/ffiliated to the Nestl\u00e9 Pension Plan in Switzerland like all other employees, except for the Head of Operations, who is a/ffiliated to the Expatriate Swiss Life Pension Plan in Switzerland, and the Chief Communications O/fficer. The Heads of Zone North America and of Zone Greater China are also a/ffiliated to the local pension plans, as are the Chief Communications O/fficer and the Head of Operations, who remained on US pension plans in line with Nestl\u00e9's Corporate Expatriation Policy. The employer's contributions for future pension benefits are included in the compensation amount.\n\nPensionable earnings include the Annual Base Salary, but not the variable compensation (Short-Term Bonus or Long-Term Incentives). Any part of the Annual Base Salary which exceeds the ceiling prescribed by Swiss Pension Law is covered directly by the Company.\n\n## Benchmarks of Executive Board compensation\n\nAny benchmark needs to take into account Nestl\u00e9's overall size, its sector and geographic location. The Compensation Committee has therefore decided that the most appropriate way to assess the competitiveness of the compensation for the Executive Board is by comparing it against the STOXX Europe 50 index (excluding financial services) as the primary benchmark ( * ) , while taking account of trends in executive remuneration in the European Fast Moving Consumer Goods and pharma companies. Reflecting the Company's size (revenue and headcount), Nestl\u00e9's competitive position has been evaluated with reference to the 75th percentile of the benchmark.\n\n## Share ownership policy\n\nFollowing an appropriate build-up period, each Executive Board member is required to hold shares at least equal to twice his/her annual base salary, absent specific circumstances. The CEO is required to hold shares at least equal to five times his Annual Base Salary.\n\nAn additional two-year blocking period is imposed on Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares delivered to Executive Board members upon vesting of PSUs, bringing the total restriction period to five years. The blocking period remains applicable upon termination of employment.\n\n## Loans\n\nThe Company does not, as a rule, grant loans, except that it may provide advances, generally repayable over a three-year period to members of the Executive Board who have been transferred to Switzerland from other Nestl\u00e9 locations in line with the Nestl\u00e9 Corporate Expatriation Policy.\n\nLoans to Executive Board members may only be granted at market conditions and may, at the time of grant, not exceed the respective member's most recent total annual compensation (art. 21 septies of the Articles of Association).\n\n## Contracts of employment and severance payments\n\nMembers of the Executive Board are subject to a notice period of 12 months. During this time, unless there was termination for cause, entitlement to the Annual Base Salary and prorated Short-Term Bonus continues. Long-Term Incentives are forfeited upon voluntary resignation or termination for cause; Long-Term Incentives immediately vest in all other cases of termination of employment. There are no severance payments or change of control provisions ('golden parachutes'). Non-compete provisions are in line with the Articles of Association and are activated by the Company only as necessary on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe compensation of the members of the Executive Board is subject to forfeiture or claw back if the compensation paid or granted is rejected by the General Meeting of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. in a final vote.",

(the Company) for the year ended 31 December 2023. The audit was limited to the information pursuant to articles 734a-734f of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) in the tables labeled 'audited' and highlighted with a blue bar on pages 38 to 56 of the Compensation Report.\n\nIn our opinion, the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO in the Compensation Report complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of association.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the tables marked 'audited' in the Compensation Report, the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the Compensation report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the Compensation Report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the audited financial information in the Compensation Report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.\n\nErnst & Young Ltd Avenue de la Gare 39a Case postale CH-1002 Lausanne",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board of directors' responsibilities for the Compensation Report\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of a Compensation Report in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of association, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of a Compensation Report that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. It is also responsible for designing the remuneration system and defining individual remuneration packages.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information pursuant to Art. 734a-734f CO is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- -Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- -Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",

Accounting policies\n\n## Accounting convention and accounting standards\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comply with IFRS Accounting Standards issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and with Swiss law.\n\nThey have been prepared on a historical cost basis, unless stated otherwise. All significant consolidated companies, joint arrangements and associates have a December 31 accounting year-end.\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements 2023 were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on February 21, 2024, and are subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting on April 18, 2024.\n\n## Accounting policies\n\nAccounting policies are included in the relevant Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and are presented as text highlighted with a grey background. The accounting policies below are applied throughout the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Key accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions\n\nThe preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements requires Group Management to exercise judgment and to make estimates and assumptions that a/ffect the application of policies, reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities as well as disclosures. Estimated climate impacts, current and probable stated regulatory changes and Nestl\u00e9's environmental commitments have been taken into account. These estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Information about potential impacts under alternative scenarios (including, among others, the policies aligned with the Paris ambition and Nestl\u00e9's environmental commitments) on the medium and long term, aligned with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) methodology, has been considered. Management believes that the Financial Statements as at December 31, 2023 reflect the most reasonable view of the value of the assets and liabilities at this date. The implications for the Group and the global economy of the war in Ukraine (described in Note 2) as well as potential escalations are highly uncertain, and remain di/fficult to predict or quantify. Actual results and outcomes could di/ffer from the judgments and estimates taken into account in these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nThose areas that involved a higher degree of judgment or uncertainty are explained further in the relevant Notes, including:\n\n- -  assessment of control and estimation of the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and the fair value of considerations received with regard to disposal of businesses (see Note 2);\n- -  recognition and estimation of revenue (see Note 3);\n- -  presentation of additional line items and subtotals in the income statement (see Note 4);\n- -  identification of a lease and lease term (see Note 8);\n- -  identification of cash generating units (CGUs) and estimation of recoverable amount for impairment tests (see Note 9);\n- -  assessment of useful lives of intangible assets, including assessment as finite or indefinite (see Note 9);\n- -  measurement of employee benefit obligations (see Note 10);\n- -  recognition and measurement of provisions (see Note 11); and\n- -  estimation of current and deferred taxes, including uncertain tax positions (see Note 13).\n\n## Foreign currencies\n\nThe functional currency of the Group's entities is the currency of their primary economic environment.\n\nIn individual companies, transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at year-end rates. Any resulting exchange di/fferences are taken to the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive income as qualifying cash flow hedges.\n\nOn consolidation, assets and liabilities of foreign operations reported in their functional currencies are translated into Swiss Francs, the Group's presentation currency, at year-end exchange rates. Income and expense are translated into Swiss Francs at the annual weighted average rates of exchange or at the rate on the date of the transaction for significant items.\n\nDi/fferences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of foreign operations, together with di/fferences arising from the translation of the net results for the year of foreign operations, are recognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nWhen there is a change of control in a foreign operation, exchange di/fferences that were recorded in equity are recognized in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.",

        "page_content": "## Hyperinflationary economies\n\nSeveral factors are considered when evaluating whether an economy is hyperinflationary, including the cumulative three-year inflation, and the degree to which the population's behaviors and government policies are consistent with such a condition.\n\nThe balance sheet and results of subsidiaries operating in hyperinflationary economies are restated for the changes in the general purchasing power of the local currency, using o/fficial indices at the balance sheet date, before translation into Swiss Francs and, as a result, are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the balance sheet date. The hyperinflationary economies in which the Group operates are listed in Note 20.\n\n## Other revenue\n\nOther revenue are primarily sales-based royalties and license fees from third parties (including associates and joint ventures) which have been earned during the period.\n\n## Expenses\n\nOperating expenses are presented in the income statement using the function of expense method, as this is the method used by management to analyze performance and is commonly used in the consumer goods industry, and thus provides more relevant information.\n\nCost of goods sold is determined on the basis of the cost of purchase or of production (comprised of the costs of raw and packaging material, direct labor, energy, manufacturing overheads and depreciation of factory assets, which are allocated to products using activity-based drivers), adjusted for the variation of inventories. It includes the cost of royalties due to third-party licensors for the use of their intellectual property, which are accrued in accordance with the respective agreement. Cost of goods sold also includes amortization of intangible assets related to acquired licenses to sell products or to use technology, as well as maintenance and depreciation of equipment used in the sales process like co/ffee machines and water coolers.\n\nAll other expenses, including those in respect of advertising and promotions, are recognized when the Group receives the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods or when it receives the services. Government grants that are not related to assets are credited to the income statement as a deduction of the related expense when they are received, if there is reasonable assurance that the terms of the grant will be met.\n\nDistribution expenses encompass the costs of storing products and transporting products between factories, warehouses and customer locations. It includes the costs of outsourced transportation services, salaries and wages of drivers, warehouse employees and customer service sta/ff, as well as depreciation and running costs of warehouses and related storage, transportation and handling equipment.\n\nMarketing and administration expenses include the costs of advertising and consumer promotion activities, merchandising, sales teams and head o/ffice functions such as finance, human resources, legal, information technology, supply chain and general management. It is primarily comprised of salaries, depreciation and maintenance of real estate, and the costs of third-party services.\n\nAdditional details of research and development, other trading income and expenses and other operating income and expenses are provided in the respective Notes.\n\n## Changes in IFRS Accounting Standards\n\nIn May 2023, the IASB issued International Tax Reform Pillar Two Model Rules (Amendments to IAS 12). The Group has applied the exception to recognizing and disclosing information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. The Group made the required disclosures in the full year 2023 Consolidated Financial Statements (see Note 13.5) in accordance with the amendment. IFRS 17 Insurance Contracts became e/ffective in 2023, but did not have a material impact on the Group's Financial Statements. Several other amendments apply for the first time in 2023 including, among others, Definition of Accounting Estimates (Amendments to IAS 8), Disclosure of Accounting Policies (Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2) and Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (Amendments to IAS 12). None of these had a material impact on the Group's Financial Statements.\n\n## Changes in IFRS Accounting Standards that may a/ffect the Group after December 31, 2023\n\nThe following standards have been issued and will become e/ffective after December 31, 2023: Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback (Amendments to IFRS 16), Non-current Liabilities with Covenants (Amendments to IAS 1), Supplier Finance Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7), and Lack of Exchangeability (Amendments to IAS 21). The Group is currently evaluating the e/ffects of these new amendments; they are not expected to have a material impact on the Group's Financial Statements in the period of initial adoption, based on the analysis so far.",

Scope of consolidation, acquisitions and disposals of businesses\n\n## Scope of consolidation\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements comprise those of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. and of its subsidiaries (the Group).\n\nCompanies which the Group controls are fully consolidated from the date at which the Group obtains control. The Group controls a company when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the company and has the ability to a/ffect those returns through its power over the company. Though the Group generally holds a majority of voting rights in the companies which are controlled, this applies irrespective of the percentage of interest in the share capital if control is obtained through agreements with other shareholders.\n\nThe war in Ukraine and the related sanctions imposed on Russia, Belarus and certain regions in Ukraine still continue to limit the freedom of Nestl\u00e9 Russia Region businesses to operate. In accordance with the accounting policy described above, the Group has re-assessed and confirmed that the changes in the legal and operating environment of Russia and Ukraine have not impacted the ability to exercise control over the Group entities in these countries.\n\nAs part of the Consolidated Financial Statements, the list of the principal subsidiaries is provided in the section Companies of the Nestl\u00e9 Group, joint arrangements and associates after Note 21.\n\n## 2.1 Change of scope of consolidation\n\n## Acquisitions\n\nThere were no significant acquisitions in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, the significant acquisition was:\n\n- -  Orgain, North America - nutritional health products (Nutrition and Health Science) 51%, April.\n\nAmong several other non-significant acquisitions, in September Nestl\u00e9 Health Science closed the acquisitions of Puravida in Brazil (a premium consumer health business) and The Better Health Company in New Zealand (a vitamins, minerals and supplements business).\n\n## Disposals\n\nIn 2023, there were no significant disposals.\n\nAmong several non-significant disposals, the European frozen pizza business has been contributed in September to a newly created joint venture company European Pizza Group (see Note 14). In addition, in September as well, the Group disposed of Palforzia , its peanut allergy treatment business, for future royalty and milestone payments dependent on the achievement of sales targets. The disposal transaction has an insignificant income statement impact, as impairment charges had been recorded in 2022 (see Note 9).",

The agreement includes options giving the right to Dr. Abraham and Butterfly Equity to sell their shares and an option for Nestl\u00e9 Health Science to buy their shares, both based on the 12-month period ending June 2024 results. Orgain complements Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's existing portfolio of nutrition products that support healthier lives. The goodwill arising on this acquisition includes synergies with existing Nestl\u00e9 Health Science's organization and growth expansion in geography and in new channels of distribution for plant-based nutrition. It is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\n\n## Acquisition-related costs\n\nAcquisition-related costs have been recognized under Other operating expenses in the income statement (see Note 4.2) for an amount of CHF 27 million (2022: CHF 46 million).",

The Company manufactures and distributes food and beverage products in the following categories: powdered and liquid beverages, water, milk, ice cream and nutrition products, prepared dishes and cooking aids, confectionery and petcare. Nestl\u00e9 also manufactures and distributes nutritional science products through its globally managed business Nestl\u00e9 Health Science. The Group has factories in 76 countries and sales in 188 countries and employs around 270 000 people.\n\n## Segment reporting\n\nBasis for segmentation\n\nOperating segments reflect the Group's management structure and the way financial information is regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is defined as the Executive Board.\n\nThe CODM considers the business from both a geographic and product perspective, through geographic Zones as well as Globally Managed Businesses (GMB). Zones and GMBs that meet the quantitative threshold of 10% of total sales, trading operating profit or assets for all operating segments are presented on a stand-alone basis as reportable segments. Even though it does not meet the reporting threshold, Nespresso is voluntarily reported separately considering its financial contribution to the Group.\n\nThe Group is organized into five Zones and two significant GMBs. Therefore, the Group's reportable segments are:\n\n- -  Zone North America (NA);\n- -  Zone Europe (EUR);\n- -  Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa (AOA);\n- -  Zone Latin America (LATAM);\n- -  Zone Greater China (GC);\n- -  Nestl\u00e9 Health Science; and\n- - Nespresso.\n\nOther business activities and operating segments are combined and presented in Other businesses.\n\nAs most operating segments represent geographic Zones, information by product is also disclosed. The seven product groups that are disclosed represent the highest categories of products that are followed internally.\n\n## Revenue and results by segment\n\nSegment results (Trading operating profit) represent the contribution of the di/fferent segments to central overheads, unallocated research and development costs and the trading operating profit of the Group. Specific corporate expenses are allocated to the corresponding segments. In addition to the Trading operating profit, Underlying trading operating profit is shown on a voluntary basis because it is one of the key metrics used by Group Management to monitor the performance of the Group.\n\nDepreciation and amortization include depreciation of property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets under leases) and amortization of intangible assets.",

        "page_content": "## Invested capital and other information by segment\n\nNo segment assets and liabilities are regularly provided to the CODM to assess segment performance or to allocate resources and therefore segment assets and liabilities are not disclosed. However, the Group discloses the invested capital, goodwill and intangible assets by segment and by product on a voluntary basis, and uses the assets directly allocated to the segments to determine if a segment is reportable.\n\nInvested capital comprises property, plant and equipment, trade receivables and some other receivables, assets held for sale, inventories, prepayments, less trade payables, accruals and some other payables, liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale and non-current other payables.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets are not included in invested capital since the amounts recognized are not comparable between segments due to di/fferences in the intensity of acquisition activity and changes in the accounting standards that were applicable at various points in time when the Group undertook significant acquisitions. Nevertheless, allocations of goodwill and intangible assets by segment and product and the related impairment expenses are provided.\n\nInter-segment eliminations represent inter-company balances between the di/fferent segments.\n\nInvested capital and goodwill and intangible assets by segment represent the situation at the end of the year, while the figures by product represent the annual average, as this provides a better indication of the level of invested capital.\n\nCapital additions represent the total cost incurred to acquire property, plant and equipment (including right-of-use assets under leases), intangible assets and goodwill, including those arising from business combinations.\n\n## Unallocated items\n\nUnallocated items represent items whose allocation to a segment or product would be arbitrary. They mainly comprise:\n\n- -  corporate expenses and related assets/liabilities;\n- -  research and development costs and related assets/liabilities; and\n- -  some goodwill and intangible assets.\n\n## Revenue\n\nSales represent amounts received and receivable from third parties for goods supplied to the customers and for services rendered. Sales are recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer, which is mainly upon arrival at the customer.\n\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration which the Group expects to receive, based on the list price applicable to a given distribution channel after deduction of returns, sales taxes, pricing allowances, other trade discounts and couponing and price promotions to consumers. The level of discounts, allowances and promotional rebates is recognized as a deduction from revenue at the time that the related sales are recognized or when the rebate is o/ffered to the customer (or consumer if applicable). They are estimated using judgments based on historical experience and the specific terms of the agreements with the customers. Payments made to customers for commercial services received are expensed. The Group has a range of credit terms which are typically short term, in line with market practice and without any financing component.",

Operating lease revenue for trade asset rentals is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nSales are disaggregated by product group and geography in Notes 3.2 and 3.4.",

Trade and other receivables/payables\n\n## 7.1 Trade and other receivables\n\n## Recognition and measurement\n\nTrade and other receivables are recognized initially at their transaction price and subsequently measured at amortized cost less loss allowances. Other receivables are comprised mainly of receivables for indirect taxes.\n\n## Expected credit losses\n\nThe Group applies the IFRS 9 simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses (ECLs) for trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime ECLs. The ECLs on trade receivables are calculated based on actual credit loss experience over the preceding three to five years on the total balance of non-credit impaired trade receivables, adjusted for forward-looking information where relevant (such as a significant deterioration in the economic environment). The Group's credit loss experience has shown that aging of receivable balances is primarily due to negotiations about variable consideration.\n\nThe Group considers a trade receivable to be credit impaired when one or more detrimental events have occurred such as:\n\n- -  significant financial di/fficulty of the customer; or\n- -  it is becoming probable that the customer will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganization.\n\nImpairment losses related to trade and other receivables are not presented separately in the consolidated income statement but are reported under the heading Marketing and administration expenses.\n\nIn millions of CHF\n\n|                                             | 2023                    | 2023                             | 2023   | 2022                    | 2022                             | 2022   |\n|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|--------|\n|                                             | Gross  carrying  amount | Expected  credit loss  allowance | Total  | Gross  carrying  amount | Expected  credit loss  allowance | Total  |\n| Trade receivables (not credit impaired)     | 9 092                   | (100)                            | 8 992  | 8 884                   | (89)                             | 8 795  |\n| Other receivables (not credit impaired)     | 2 002                   | (8)                              | 1 994  | 2 294                   | (9)                              | 2 285  |\n| Credit impaired trade and other receivables | 179                     | (170)                            | 9      | 247                     | (211)                            | 36     |\n| Total                                       | 11 273                  | (278)                            | 10 995 | 11 425                  | (309)                            | 11 116 |\n\nThe top five major customers represent 15% (2022: 15%) of trade and other receivables, none of them individually exceeding 6% (2022: 8%).\n\nBased on the historic trend and expected performance of the customers, the Group believes that the above expected credit loss allowance su/fficiently covers the risk of default.",

The arrangements avoid concentration of liquidity risk, since the due dates of the payments by the Group are based on the agreed trade terms with the suppliers, are compliant with the applicable regulations and remain consistent with the normal operating cycle of its business.\n\nThe Group continues to present invoices eligible to be settled through these programs as Trade payables considering that the original liability is neither legally released nor substantially modified on entering into such arrangements.

The residual values are 30% on head o/ffices and nil for all other asset types. The useful lives are as follows:\n\n| Buildings                                                     | 20 - 40  years   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|\n| Machinery and equipment                                       | 10 - 25 years    |\n| Tools, furniture, information technology and sundry equipment | 3 - 15 years     |\n| Vehicles                                                      | 3 - 10  years    |\n\nLand is not depreciated.\n\nUseful lives, components and residual amounts are reviewed annually. Such a review takes into consideration the nature of the assets, their intended use, including but not limited to the closure of facilities, the evolution of technology and competitive pressures.\n\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment is allocated to the appropriate headings of expenses by function in the income statement.\n\nBorrowing costs incurred during the course of construction are capitalized if the assets under construction are significant and if their construction requires a substantial period to complete (typically more than one year). The capitalization rate is determined on the basis of the short-term borrowing rate for the period of construction.\n\nGovernment grants are recognized as deferred income which is released to the income statement over the useful life of the related assets.",

        "page_content": "## Impairment of property, plant and equipment\n\nReviews of the carrying amount of the Group's property, plant and equipment are performed when there is an indication of impairment. An indicator could be technological obsolescence, unfavorable development of a business under competitive pressures or severe economic slowdown in a given market as well as reorganization of the operations to leverage their scale. Earlier than planned retirement of property, plant and equipment due to a transition to a low carbon economy, Nestl\u00e9's commitments regarding recyclable or reusable packaging, reduction of virgin plastic and Nestl\u00e9's Net Zero Roadmap on greenhouse gas emissions are also considered as triggers for impairment.\n\nIn assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value, based on the time value of money and the risks specific to the country where the assets are located. The risks specific to the asset are included in the determination of the cash flows.\n\nImpairment of property, plant and equipment arises mainly from plans to optimize industrial manufacturing capacities by closing or selling ine/fficient production facilities and underperforming businesses. The majority of Nestl\u00e9's emissions are classified as Scope 3 (i. e. indirect emissions that occur across Nestl\u00e9's value chain and outside of Nestl\u00e9's direct control), and the property, plant and equipment are geographically widespread. Therefore, property, plant and equipment are not materially exposed to climate transition risks nor to physical climate risks, and no significant climate-related triggers for impairment have been identified.\n\n## 8.2 Leases - Group as a lessee\n\nThe Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. This assessment involves the exercise of judgment about whether it depends on a specified asset, whether the Group obtains substantially all the economic benefits from the use of that asset, and whether the Group has the right to the direct use of the asset.\n\nThe Group recognizes a right-of-use (ROU) asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date, except for short-term leases of 12 months or less which are expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses an incremental borrowing rate specific to the country, term and currency of the contract. Lease payments can include fixed payments, variable payments that depend on an index or rate known at the commencement date, and extension option payments or purchase options which the Group is reasonably certain to exercise. The lease liability is subsequently measured at amortized cost using the e/ffective interest rate method and remeasured (with a corresponding adjustment to the related ROU asset) when there is a change in future lease payments in case of renegotiation, changes of an index or rate, or in case of reassessment of options.\n\nAt inception, the ROU asset comprises the initial lease liability, initial direct costs and the obligation to refurbish the asset, less any incentives granted by the lessors. The ROU asset is depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or the useful life of the underlying asset. The ROU asset is subject to testing for impairment if there is an indicator for impairment, as for owned assets.",

Lease terms are negotiated on an individual basis and contain a wide range of di/fferent terms and conditions. Leases are typically made for a fixed period of 5-15 years and may include extension options which provide operational flexibility. If the Group exercised all extension options not currently included in the lease liability, the additional payments would amount to CHF 0.9 billion (undiscounted) as at December 31, 2023.\n\n## Vehicle leases\n\nThe Group leases trucks for distribution in specific businesses and cars for management and sales functions. The average contract duration is 6 years for trucks and 3 years for cars.\n\n## Other leases\n\nThe Group also leases machinery and equipment, and tools, furniture and other equipment that are each insignificant to the total leased asset portfolio.\n\n## 8.2b Right-of-use assets\n\n|                                                                                    | Land and  buildings   | Vehicles   | Other   | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|------------|---------|---------|\n| Net carrying amount                                                                |                       |            |         |         |\n| As at January 1, 2023                                                              | 2 203                 | 152        | 246     | 2 601   |\n| Additions                                                                          | 523                   | 128        | 173     | 824     |\n| Depreciation                                                                       | (465)                 | (82)       | (95)    | (642)   |\n| Impairments                                                                        | -                     | -          | -       | -       |\n| Classification (to)/from held-for-sale and change of scope   of consolidation, net | 3                     | -          | -       | 3       |\n| Currency retranslations and others                                                 | (169)                 | (19)       | (19)    | (207)   |\n| As at December 31, 2023                                                            | 2 095                 | 179        | 305     | 2 579   |\n| Net carrying amount                                                                |                       |            |         |         |\n| As at January 1, 2022                                                              | 2 307                 | 169        | 230     | 2 706   |\n| Additions                                                                          | 612                   | 78         | 92      | 782     |\n| Depreciation                                                                       | (476)                 | (86)       | (85)    | (647)   |\n| Impairments                                                                        | (76)                  | -          | -       | (76)    |\n| Classification (to)/from held-for-sale and change of scope   of consolidation, net | (3)                   | -          | 1       | (2)     |\n| Currency retranslations and others  (a)                                            | (161)                 | (9)        | 8       | (162)   |\n| As at December 31, 2022                                                            | 2 203                 | 152        | 246     | 2 601   |\n\n- (a)   Including CHF 101 million of derecognition of right-of-use assets that are being sub-leased.",

Goodwill and intangible assets\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill is initially recognized during a business combination (see Note 2). Subsequently it is measured at cost less impairment.\n\n## Intangible assets\n\nThis heading includes intangible assets that are internally generated or acquired, either separately or in a business combination, when they are identifiable and can be reliably measured. Internally generated intangible assets (mainly management information system software) are capitalized, provided that there is an identifiable asset that will be useful in generating future benefits in terms of savings, economies of scale, etc. Payments made to third parties in order to in-license or acquire intellectual property rights, compounds and products are capitalized as non-commercialized intangible assets, as they are separately identifiable and are expected to generate future benefits.\n\nNon-commercialized intangible assets are not amortized, but tested for impairment (see Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets below). Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under Other operating expenses. They are reclassified as commercialized intangible assets once development is complete, usually when approval for sales has been granted by the relevant regulatory authority.\n\nCommercialized indefinite life intangible assets mainly comprise certain brands, trade marks, operating rights and intellectual property rights which can be renewed without significant cost and are supported by ongoing marketing activities. They are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an impairment indicator is present. Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under Other trading expenses. The assessment of the classification of intangible assets as indefinite is reviewed annually.",

        "page_content": "Finite life intangible assets are amortized over the shorter of their contractual or useful economic lives. They comprise mainly management information systems and commercialized patents and rights to carry on an activity (e.g. exclusive rights to sell products or to perform a supply activity). They are amortized assuming a zero residual value on a straight-line basis. Useful lives are as follows: management information systems over 3 to 8 years; other finite intangible assets over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the related contractual period, from 5 to 25 years. Useful lives and residual values are reviewed annually. Amortization of finite life intangible assets starts when they are available for use and is allocated to the appropriate headings of expenses by function in the income statement. Any impairment charge is recorded in the consolidated income statement under Other trading expenses.\n\n## Research and development\n\nInternal research costs are charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred. Development costs are only recognized as assets on the balance sheet if all the recognition criteria set by IAS 38 - Intangible Assets are met before the products are launched on the market. Development costs are generally charged to the income statement in the year in which they are incurred due to uncertainties inherent in the development of new products because the expected future economic benefits cannot be reliably determined. As long as the products have not reached the market place (or obtained regulatory approval if necessary), there is no reliable evidence that positive future cash flows would be obtained.\n\nCapitalized development costs are subsequently accounted for as described in the section Intangible assets above.",

Finite life intangible assets are tested when there is an indication of impairment.\n\nThe annual impairment tests are performed at the same time each year and at the cash generating unit (CGU) level. The Group defines its groups of CGUs for goodwill impairment testing based on the way that it monitors and derives economic benefits from the acquired goodwill. The CGUs are generally defined at the level of the product category per Zone, or at the level of the GMB if the products are managed on a global basis.\n\nFor indefinite life intangible assets, the Group performs the test at the level of the smallest identifiable assets or group of assets that generate cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. Finally, non-commercialized intangible assets are tested at the level of the intangible asset itself.\n\nThe impairment tests are performed by comparing the carrying amount of the assets of these CGUs with their recoverable amount, usually based on their fair value less costs of disposal, but occasionally on their value in use.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of goodwill is never subsequently reversed.",

None of them are individually significant.\n\nIn 2022, the impairment charge mainly related to the impairment of Palforzia's intangible assets composed of intellectual property rights, trademarks and trade names and noncommercialized intangibles (operating segment Nestl\u00e9 Health Science) and other various non-significant impairments of intangible assets and goodwill (predominantly in Zone NA operating segment, which related to Freshly's brand, see Notes 2.1 and 14).\n\nSlower than expected adoption by patients and healthcare professionals had impacted the penetration of the United States market for Palforzia , the peanut allergy treatment that was acquired in 2020 under the Aimmune Therapeutics acquisition. Considering this situation, the Group announced in the second half of the year 2022 that it had decided to explore strategic options for Palforzia and had decided to cease investments in further developments of non-commercialized intangibles. As a result, an impairment charge of CHF 1.6 billion was recorded in the second half of the year 2022 for brand and intellectual property rights based on a fair value less costs of disposal valuation. Before this change of strategy, an impairment charge of CHF 0.3 billion had been recognized in the first half of the year 2022 under Impairment of intangible assets on the intellectual property rights after revisions to projected cash flows considering the business performance since acquisition. Impairments for Palforzia were recognized under the heading Other trading expenses (see Note 4.1) for the patents and brand, and under the heading Other operating expenses (see Note 4.2) for non-commercialized intangible assets (capitalized cost of trials prior to granting of approval by the relevant authorities).\n\n## 9.1.2 Annual impairment tests\n\nGoodwill impairment reviews have been conducted for more than 30 Cash Generating Units (CGU). Impairment reviews on intangible assets with indefinite useful life ('IAIUL') were performed at the level of the smallest identifiable assets or group of assets.",

carrying amount. The recoverable amount has been determined based upon a fair value less costs of disposal calculation. Generally, no directly observable market inputs are available to assess the fair value less costs of disposal. Therefore, the calculation is based on net present value techniques (fair value measurements categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy). Cash flows are projected over 5 years. They are extrapolated using a steady or declining terminal growth rate.\n\nFinally, the following are taken into account in the impairment tests:\n\n- -  The cash flows are discounted at post-tax weighted average rates. The discount rates are computed based on external sources of information and reflect the time value of money and country specific risk.\n- -  The cash flows are based upon financial plans approved by Group Management which are consistent with the Group's approved strategy for this period. They are based on past performance and current initiatives. The business risk is included in the determination of the cash flows.",

Sales growth, margin evolution and terminal growth are adjusted if necessary, considering the resilience of the CGUs to climate change risks as well as Nestl\u00e9's commitments to tackle climate change (including the Group's 'Net Zero Roadmap'). In addition, the headroom of the CGUs is compared to information obtained from Nestl\u00e9's climate scenario modeling prepared in accordance with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. The outcomes of the scenarios analyzed (selected high, intermediate and low emissions scenarios) are probability weighted and proportionally allocated and compared to the headroom of each CGU.

In addition, certain Group employees are eligible for long-term incentives in the form of equity compensation plans, for which the cost amounts to CHF 207 million (2022: CHF 181 million). Employee remuneration is allocated to the appropriate headings of expenses by function (see Note 1, section Expenses).\n\n## 10.2 Post-employment benefits\n\nThe liabilities of the Group arising from defined benefit obligations, and the related current service cost, are determined using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial advice is provided both by external consultants and by actuaries employed by the Group. The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the defined benefit obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which the plan is located. Such plans are either funded or unfunded. The deficit or excess of the fair value of plan assets over the present value of the defined benefit obligations is recognized as a liability or an asset on the balance sheet.\n\nPension costs charged to the income statement consist of service cost (current and past service cost, gains and losses arising from curtailment and settlement) and administration costs (other than costs of managing plan assets), which are allocated to the appropriate heading by function, and net interest expense or income, which is presented as part of net financial income/(expense). The actual return less interest income on plan assets, changes in actuarial assumptions, and di/fferences between actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred are reported in other comprehensive income. Some benefits are also provided by defined contribution plans. Contributions to such plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.\n\nCertain disclosures are presented by geographic area. The five regions disclosed are North America (NA), Europe (EUR), Asia, Oceania and Africa including Middle East (AOA), Latin America (LATAM) and Greater China (GC). Each region includes the corresponding Zones as well as the portion of the GMB activity in that region.\n\n## Pensions and retirement benefits\n\nApart from legally required social security arrangements, the majority of Group employees are eligible for benefits through pension plans in case of retirement, death in service, disability and resignation. Those plans are either defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans based on pensionable remuneration and length of service.\n\nThe Group manages its pension plans by geographic area and the major plans, classified as defined benefit plans under IAS 19, are located in EUR (Switzerland, United Kingdom and Germany) and in NA (USA). In accordance with applicable legal frameworks, these plans have governing bodies which have a fiduciary responsibility to oversee the management of the plans. The Group oversees the pension plans through the Group Corporate Pension Board.",

The pension plan guarantees the amount accrued on members' savings accounts, as well as a minimum interest on those savings accounts. At retirement date, the savings accounts are converted into pensions. However, members may opt to receive part of the pension as a lump sum. Increases of pensions in payment are granted on a discretionary basis by the Board of Trustees, subject to the financial situation of the plan. There is also a defined benefit plan that was closed to new entrants in 2013 and whose members below age 55 on that date were transferred to the cash balance plan. This heritage plan is a hybrid between a cash balance plan and a plan based on a final pensionable salary. Finally, the Group has committed to make additional contributions in coordination with a decrease in conversion rates applicable since July 1, 2018. CHF 237 million had been contributed as at December 31, 2023, and CHF 67 million is expected to be paid until 2038.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Nestl\u00e9's pension plan is a hybrid arrangement combining a defined benefit career average section plus a defined contribution section. The defined benefit section was closed to new entrants during 2016. In the defined benefit section, from August 2017 onwards, members accrue a pension defined on their capped salary each year, plus defined contribution provision above the capped salary. Accrued pensions are automatically revalued according to inflation, subject to caps. Similarly, pensions in payment are increased annually in line with inflation, subject to caps as applicable. At retirement, there is a lump sum option. Finally, the funding of the Nestl\u00e9 UK Pension Fund is defined on the basis of a triennial independent actuarial valuation in accordance with local regulations. As a result, an amount of CHF 438 million (equivalent GBP 348 million) was paid by Nestl\u00e9 UK Ltd in 2021 in accordance with the previous valuation as at December 31, 2018. The last triennial valuation as at December 31, 2021 was completed in 2022 and confirmed that no deficit contributions were required.\n\nIn Germany, there are cash balance plans, where members benefit from a guarantee on their savings accounts. Contributions to the plans are expressed as a percentage of the pensionable salary. Increases to pensions in payment are granted in accordance with legal requirements. There is also a heritage plan, based on final pensionable salary, which has been closed to new entrants since 2006.\n\nIn the USA, Nestl\u00e9's primary pension plan is a pension equity design, under which members earn pension credits each year based on a schedule related to the sum of their age and service with Nestl\u00e9. A member's benefit is the sum of the annual pension credits earned, multiplied by an average earning payable as a lump sum. However, in lieu of the lump sum, members have the option of converting the benefit to a monthly pension annuity. The plan does not provide for automatic pension increases and members do not contribute to the plan. This plan was closed to new entrants at the end of 2015 and replaced by a defined contribution scheme. Finally, in August 2022, a buyout transaction with a third-party insurance company was completed and USD 819 million (equivalent CHF 783 million) of defined benefit obligations were removed from the Group balance sheet. This transaction did not change the pension benefits provided to pensioners.\n\n## Post-employment medical benefits and other employee benefits\n\nSubsidiaries, principally in NA and LATAM, maintain medical benefit plans, classified as defined benefit plans under IAS 19, which cover eligible retired employees. The obligations for other employee benefits consist mainly of end-of-service indemnities, which do not have the character of pensions.",

        "page_content": "## Risks related to defined benefit plans\n\nThe main risks to which the Group is exposed in relation to operating defined benefit plans are:\n\n- -  market and liquidity risks: these are the risks that the investments do not meet the expected returns over the medium to long term. This also encompasses the mismatch between assets and liabilities. In order to minimize the risks, the structure of the portfolios is reviewed and asset-liability matching analyses are performed on a regular basis when relevant.\n- -  mortality risk: the assumptions adopted by the Group make allowance for future improvements in life expectancy. However, if life expectancy improves at a faster rate than assumed, this would generally result in greater payments from the plans and consequent increases in the plans' liabilities. In order to minimize this risk, mortality assumptions are reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nAs certain of the Group's pension arrangements permit benefits to be adjusted in the case that downside risks emerge, the Group does not always have full exposure to the risks described above.\n\n## Plan amendments and restructuring events\n\nPlans within the Group are regularly reviewed as to whether they are aligned with market practice in the local context. Should a review indicate that a plan needs to be changed, prior agreement with the local governing body, the regulator and, if applicable, the members is sought before implementing plan changes.\n\nIn 2023, as in 2022, there were plan amendments and restructuring activities (among others risk transfer transactions related to medical and retirement liabilities of pensioners) leading to curtailments and settlements, individually not significant, amounting to a net cost of CHF 23 million (2022: CHF 78 million net income).\n\n## Asset-liability management and funding arrangement\n\nGoverning bodies are responsible for determining the mix of asset classes and target allocations of Nestl\u00e9's plans with the support of investment advisors and/or local asset management firms. Periodic reviews of the asset mix are made by external parties to assess the adequacy of the portfolio's structure. Such analyses aim at dynamically comparing the fair value of the assets and liabilities in order to determine the most adequate strategic asset allocation.\n\nThe overall investment policy and strategy for the Group's funded defined benefit plans are guided by the objective of achieving an investment return which, together with the contributions paid, is su/fficient to maintain reasonable control over the various funding risks of the plans. To the extent possible, the risks are shared equally amongst the di/fferent stakeholders. As those risks evolve with the development of capital markets and asset management activities, the Group addresses the assessment and control process of the major investment pension risks. In order to protect the Group's defined benefit plans funding ratio and to mitigate the financial risks, protective measures on the investment strategies are in force. Risks pertaining to sustainability, social and climate factors are also taken into consideration. The Group has a policy guiding the pension plan governing bodies to review the impact of climate risk on their investment portfolios and apply TCFD recommendations in case it is required by local pension legislation.",

Provisions and contingencies\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions comprise liabilities of uncertain timing or amount that arise from restructuring plans, environmental, litigation and other risks. Provisions are recognized when a legal or constructive obligation stemming from a past event exists and when the future cash outflows can be reliably estimated. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expenditures unless the impact of discounting is immaterial. Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognized when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such plans will be carried out by either starting to implement them or announcing their main features. Obligations under litigation reflect Group Management's best estimate of the outcome based on the facts known at the balance sheet date.\n\n## Contingent assets and liabilities\n\nContingent assets and liabilities are possible rights and obligations that arise from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not fully within the control of the Group.",

These include plans to optimize production, sales and administration structures, mainly allocated to Zone EUR and Zone GC. Restructuring provisions are expected to result in future cash outflows when implementing the plans (usually over one to three years).\n\n## Legal and indirect tax\n\nLegal provisions have been established to cover legal and administrative settlements that arise in the course of business. Indirect tax provisions include disputes and uncertainties on non-income taxes (mainly VAT and sales taxes). They cover numerous separate cases whose detailed disclosure could be detrimental to the Group's interests. The Group does not believe that any of these cases will have a material adverse impact on its financial position. The timing of outflows is uncertain as it depends upon the outcome of the cases. Group Management does not believe it is possible to make assumptions on the evolution of these cases beyond the balance sheet date.\n\n## Other\n\nOther provisions are mainly constituted by onerous contracts and various damage claims that occurred during the year but were not covered by insurance companies. Onerous contracts result from the termination of contracts or supply agreements above market prices in which the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received or for which no benefits are expected to be received.",

Possible payments for litigations relate mainly to various investigations as well as labor, civil and tax litigations in LATAM.\n\nWith food safety as a primary goal, operating practices at some of Nestl\u00e9's natural mineral water production sites may not be in line with the applicable regulatory framework. The Group has not identified material liabilities as at the balance sheet date related to such practices. In this context, no provisions were recognized nor were material contingent liabilities identified.\n\nOn January 11, 2024, the French Competition Authority (Autorit\u00e9 de la concurrence) published its decision related to its October 12, 2021 Statement of Objections regarding allegations against certain Nestl\u00e9 subsidiaries in France (namely allegations of restricted competition relating to, among others, communication on the removal of bisphenol A from metal packaging). Nestl\u00e9 had notified the receipt of this statement in its press release of October 13, 2021. In the decision published on January 11, 2024, Nestl\u00e9 was not fined nor sanctioned in any way.\n\nContingent assets for litigation claims in favor of the Group amount to a probable recoverable amount of CHF 18 million (2022: CHF 60 million), mainly in LATAM.",

        "page_content": "## 12. Financial instruments\n\n## Financial assets - classes and categories\n\nThe classification of financial assets is generally based on the business model in which a financial asset is managed as well as its contractual cash flow characteristics. The Group classifies financial assets in the following categories:\n\n- -  measured at amortized cost;\n- -  measured at fair value through the income statement (abbreviated as FVTPL, fair value through profit or loss); and\n- -   measured at fair value through Other comprehensive income (abbreviated as FVOCI).\n- For an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to classify it as measured at FVOCI. This election is made at initial recognition on an investment by investment basis.\n\n## Financial assets - recognition and derecognition\n\nThe settlement date is used for initial recognition and derecognition of financial assets, as these transactions are generally under contracts whose terms require delivery within the time frame established by regulation or convention in the market place (regular-way purchase or sale). Financial assets are derecognized when substantially all of the Group's rights to cash flows from the financial assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.\n\n## Financial assets - measurement\n\nFinancial assets are initially recognized at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. However, when a financial asset measured at FVTPL is recognized, the transaction costs are expensed immediately. Subsequent remeasurement of financial assets is determined by their category, which is revisited at each reporting date.\n\nCommercial paper and time deposits are held by the Group's treasury unit in a separate portfolio in order to mitigate the credit risk exposure of the Group and provide interest income. The Group considers that these investments are held within a business model whose objective is achieved by collecting contractual cash flows. The contractual terms of these financial assets give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. These assets have therefore been classified as measured at amortized cost.\n\nInvestments in equities, debt funds, equity funds as well as other financial assets not giving rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest are classified at FVTPL. These investments are mainly related to liquidity management and self-insurance activities.\n\n## Financial assets - impairment\n\nThe Group assesses whether its financial assets carried at amortized cost and FVOCI are impaired on the basis of expected credit losses (ECL). This analysis requires the identification of significant increases in the credit risk of the counterparties. Considering that the majority of the Group's financial assets are trade receivables, the analysis also integrates statistical data reflecting the past experience of losses incurred due to default, as well as any relevant forward-looking information. See Note 7.1 for impairments related to trade receivables.",

        "page_content": "The Group measures loss allowances for investments in debt securities and time deposits that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date at an amount equal to 12 months' expected credit losses. The Group considers a debt security to have low credit risk when the credit rating is 'investment grade' according to internationally recognized rating agencies.\n\nTo assess whether there is a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, the Group considers available reasonable and supportive information, such as changes in the credit rating of the counterparty. If there is a significant increase in credit risk, the loss allowance is measured at an amount equal to lifetime expected losses.\n\nECLs are a probability-weighted estimate of credit losses. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls due to a credit default event of the counterparty (i.e. the di/fference between the cash flows in accordance with the contract and the cash flows that the Group expects to receive).\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the gross carrying amount of the assets. For debt securities at FVOCI, the loss allowance is recognized in Other comprehensive income, instead of reducing the carrying amount of the asset.\n\nImpairment losses on other financial assets related to treasury activities are presented under Financial expenses.\n\nThe model and some of the assumptions used in calculating these ECLs are key sources of estimation uncertainty.\n\n## Financial liabilities at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognized at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Subsequent to initial measurement, financial liabilities are recognized at amortized cost. The di/fference between the initial carrying amount of the financial liabilities and their redemption value is recognized in the income statement over the contractual term, using the e/ffective interest rate method. This category includes the following classes of financial liabilities: trade and other payables, commercial papers, bonds, lease liabilities and other financial liabilities.\n\nFinancial liabilities at amortized cost are classified as current or non-current, depending on whether they are due within 12 months after the balance sheet date or beyond.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognized (in full or partly) when either the Group is discharged from its obligation, they expire, they are cancelled or they are replaced by a new liability with substantially modified terms.",

Examples include exchange-traded commodity derivatives and financial assets such as investments in equity and debt securities.\n- -  Level 2: the fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques based on observable market data. Such valuation techniques include discounted cash flows, standard valuation models based on market parameters for interest rates, yield curves or foreign exchange rates, dealer quotes for similar instruments and comparable arm's length transactions. For example, the fair value of forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows.\n- -  Level 3: the fair value of financial instruments that are measured on the basis of entity specific valuations using inputs that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). When the fair value of unquoted instruments cannot be measured with su/fficient reliability, the Group carries such instruments at cost less impairment, if applicable.\n\nIn millions of CHF\n\n|                                                                | 2023   | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Derivative assets                                              | 132    | 73     |\n| Bonds and debt funds                                           | 284    | 225    |\n| Equity and equity funds                                        | 115    | 535    |\n| Other financial assets                                         | 38     | 58     |\n| Derivative liabilities                                         | (52)   | (70)   |\n| Prices quoted in active markets (Level 1)                      | 517    | 821    |\n| Derivative assets                                              | 267    | 222    |\n| Bonds and debt funds                                           | 435    | 468    |\n| Equity and equity funds                                        | 447    | 405    |\n| Other financial assets                                         | 557    | 609    |\n| Derivative liabilities                                         | (504)  | (752)  |\n| Valuation techniques based on observable market data (Level 2) | 1 202  | 952    |\n| Financial assets                                               | 200    | 143    |\n| Valuation techniques based on unobservable input (Level 3)     | 200    | 143    |\n| Total financial instruments at fair value                      | 1 919  | 1 916  |\n\nThere have been no significant transfers between the di/fferent hierarchy levels in 2023 and in 2022.",

This Note presents the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its financial risk and capital.\n\nFinancial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed. The Board of Directors determines the financial control principles as well as the principles of financial planning. The Chief Executive O/fficer organizes, manages and monitors all financial risks, including asset and liability matters.\n\nThe Asset and Liability Management Committee (ALMC) chaired by the Chief Financial O/fficer, is the governing body for the establishment and subsequent execution of the Nestl\u00e9 Group's Financial Asset and Liability Management Policy. It ensures implementation of strategies and achievement of objectives of the Group's financial asset and liabilities management, which are executed by the Center Treasury, the Regional Treasury Centers and, in specific local circumstances, by the subsidiaries. Approved treasury management guidelines define and classify risks as well as determine, by category of transaction, specific approval, execution and monitoring procedures. The activities of the Center Treasury and of the Regional Treasury Centers are monitored by an independent Middle O/ffice, which verifies the compliance of the strategies and/or operations with the approved guidelines and decisions taken by the ALMC.\n\n## 12.2a Credit risk\n\n## Credit risk management\n\nCredit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises on financial assets (liquid, noncurrent and derivatives) and on trade and other receivables.\n\nThe Group aims to minimize the credit risk of liquid assets, non-current financial assets and derivative assets through the application of risk manage ment policies. Credit limits are set based on each counterparty's size and risk of default. The methodology used to set the credit limit considers the counterparty's balance sheet, credit ratings, risk ratios and default probabilities. Counterparties are monitored regularly, taking into consideration the evolution of the above parameters, as well as their share prices and credit default swaps. As a result of this review, changes on credit limits and risk allocation are carried out. The Group avoids the concentration of credit risk on its liquid assets by spreading them over several institutions and sectors.\n\nTrade receivables are subject to credit limits, control and approval procedures in all the subsidiaries. Due to its large geographic base and number of customers, the Group is not exposed to material concentrations of credit risk on its trade receivables (see Note 7.1). Nevertheless, commercial counterparties are constantly monitored in accordance with the same methodology used for financial counterparties.\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk resulting from financial activities, without considering netting agreements and without taking into account any collateral held or other credit enhancements, is equal to the carrying amount of the Group's financial assets.",

The credit risk of the financial assets is assessed based on the risk of the counterparties, including the associated country risk.

Such risk may result from inadequate market depth or disruption or refinancing problems. The Group's objective is to manage this risk by limiting exposures to financial instruments that may be a/ffected by liquidity problems and by maintaining su/fficient back-up facilities. The Group does not expect any refinancing issues and in October 2023 successfully extended the term of both its revolving credit facilities:\n\n- -  A USD 3.0 billion and EUR 3.7 billion revolving credit facility with an initial maturity date of November 2024. The Group has the ability to convert the facility into a one-year term loan.\n- -  A USD 2.2 billion and EUR 2.3 billion revolving credit facility with a new maturity date of October 2028.\n\nThe facilities serve primarily as a backstop to the Group's short-term debt.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to foreign currency risk from transactions and translation.\n\nTransactional exposures arise from transactions in foreign currency. They are managed\n\nwithin a prudent and systematic hedging policy in accordance with the Group's specific\n\nbusiness needs through the use of currency forwards, futures, swaps and options.\n\nExchange di/fferences recorded in the income statement represented a loss of CHF 452 million in 2023 (2022: loss of CHF 202 million). They are allocated to the appropriate headings of expenses by function.\n\nTranslation exposure arises from the consolidation of the financial statements of foreign operations in Swiss Francs, which can be subject to hedge.\n\nValue at Risk (VaR) based on historic data for a 250-day period and a confidence level of 95% results in a potential one-day loss for currency risk of less than CHF 10 million in 2023 (2022: less than CHF 15 million).\n\nThe Group cannot predict future movements in exchange rates, therefore the above VaR neither represents actual losses nor considers the e/ffects of favorable movements in underlying variables. Accordingly, the VaR may only be considered indicative of future movements to the extent that historic market patterns repeat in the future.\n\n## Interest rate risk\n\nThe Group is exposed primarily to fluctuations in USD and EUR interest rates. Interest rate risk on financial debt is managed based on duration and interest management targets set by the ALMC through the use of fixed-rate debt and interest rate swaps.\n\nTaking into account the impact of interest derivatives, the proportion of financial debt subject to fixed interest rates for a period longer than one year represents 83% (2022: 80%).\n\nBased on the level of Liquid assets and Debt exposed to floating interest rates at year-end, an increase in interest rates of 100 basis points would cause an increase in Net financing cost of CHF 12 million on an annualized basis (2022: an increase in Net financing cost of CHF 41 million).\n\n## Price risk\n\nCommodity price risk\n\nCommodity price risk arises from transactions on the world commodity markets to secure supplies of green co/ffee, cocoa beans, cereals and grains and other commodities necessary for the manufacture of some of the Group's products.\n\nThe Group's objective is to minimize the impact of commodity price fluctuations and this exposure is hedged in accordance with the Nestl\u00e9 Group's policy on commodity price risk management. The Global Procurement Organization is responsible for managing commodity price risk based on internal directives and centrally determined limits, generally using exchange-traded commodity derivatives. The commodity price risk exposure of future purchases is managed using a combination of derivatives (mainly futures and options) and executory contracts. This activity is monitored by an independent Middle O/ffice. Given the short product business cycle of the Group, the majority of the anticipated future raw material transactions outstanding at the balance sheet date are expected to occur in the next year.\n\n## Equity price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to equity price risk on investments. To manage the price risk arising from these investments, the Group diversifies its portfolios in accordance with the guidelines set by the Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## 12.2d Derivative assets and liabilities and hedge accounting\n\n## Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group's derivatives mainly consist of currency forwards, options and swaps; commodity futures and options and interest rate swaps. Derivatives are mainly used to manage exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risk as described in Note 12.2c Market risk.\n\nDerivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the trade date. They are subsequently remeasured at fair value on a regular basis and at each reporting date as a minimum. The Group applies hedge accounting to hedging relationships that meet the qualifying criteria.\n\n## Hedge accounting\n\nThe Group designates and documents the use of certain derivatives and other financial assets or financial liabilities as hedging instruments against changes in fair value of recognized assets and liabilities (fair value hedges) and highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges), and against the e/ffects of the translation of net investments in foreign operations (net investment hedges). The e/ffectiveness of such hedges is assessed at inception and verified at regular intervals and at least on a quarterly basis to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and the hedging instrument.\n\nThe Group generally excludes from the designation of the hedging relationship the hedging cost element. Subsequently, this cost element impacts the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged item.\n\nFor the designation of hedging relationships on commodities, the Group applies the component hedging model when the hedged item is separately identifiable and measurable in the contract to purchase the materials.\n\n## Fair value hedges\n\nThe Group uses fair value hedges to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risks of its recognized assets and liabilities, being mostly financial debt.\n\nChanges in fair value of hedging instruments designated as fair value hedges and the adjustments for the risks being hedged in the carrying amounts of the underlying transactions are recognized in the income statement.\n\n## Cash flow hedges\n\nThe Group uses cash flow hedges to mitigate a particular risk associated with a recognized asset or liability or highly probable forecast transactions, such as anticipated future export sales, purchases of equipment and goods, as well as the variability of expected interest payments and receipts.\n\nThe e/ffective part of the changes in fair value of hedging instruments is recognized in Other comprehensive income, while any ine/ffective part is recognized immediately in the income statement. Ine/ffectiveness for hedges of foreign currency and commodity price risk may result from changes in the timing of the forecast transactions. When the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, including acquired businesses, the gains or losses previously recognized in Other comprehensive income are included in the measurement of the cost of the asset or of the liability. Otherwise the gains or losses previously recognized in Other comprehensive income are recognized in the income statement at the same time as the hedged transaction.",

The e/ffective results of net investment hedges are recycled to the income statement when the hedged foreign operation is disposed of.\n\n## Undesignated derivatives\n\nDerivatives which are not designated in a hedging relationship are classified as undesignated derivatives.

It is the Group's policy to maintain a sound capital base to support the continued development of its business.\n\nThe Board of Directors seeks to maintain a prudent balance between di/fferent components of the Group's capital. The ALMC monitors the capital structure and net financial debt by currency (see Note 16.5 for the definition of net financial debt).\n\nThe operating cash flow-to-net financial debt ratio highlights the ability of a business to repay its debts. As at December 31, 2023, the ratio was 32.1% (2022: 24.7%). The Group's subsidiaries have complied with local statutory capital requirements as appropriate.",

        "page_content": "## 13. Taxes\n\nThe Group is subject to taxes in di/fferent countries all over the world. Taxes and fiscal risks recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements reflect Group Management's best estimate of the outcome based on the facts known at the balance sheet date in each individual country. These facts may include but are not limited to changes in tax laws and interpretation thereof in the various jurisdictions where the Group operates. They may have an impact on the income tax as well as the resulting assets and liabilities. Any di/fferences between tax estimates and final tax assessments are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, unless anticipated.\n\nTaxes include current and deferred taxes on profit as well as actual or potential withholding taxes on current and expected transfers of income from subsidiaries and tax adjustments relating to prior years. Income tax is recognized in the income statement, except to the extent that it relates to items directly taken to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognized against equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nDeferred taxes are based on the temporary di/fferences that arise when taxation authorities recognize and measure assets and liabilities with rules that di/ffer from the principles of the Consolidated Financial Statements. They also arise on temporary di/fferences stemming from tax losses carried forward.\n\nDeferred taxes are calculated under the liability method at the rates of tax expected to prevail when the temporary di/fferences reverse, subject to such rates being substantially enacted at the balance sheet date. Any changes in the tax rates are recognized in the income statement unless related to items directly recognized against equity or other comprehensive income. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized on all taxable temporary di/fferences excluding non-deductible goodwill. Deferred tax assets are recognized on all deductible temporary di/fferences provided that it is probable that future taxable income will be available.\n\n## 13.1 Components of taxes recognized in the income statement\n\n| In millions of CHF                               |         |         |\n|--------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|\n|                                                  | 2023    | 2022    |\n| Current taxes  (a)                               | (2 891) | (2 566) |\n| Deferred taxes                                   | 784     | (48)    |\n| Taxes reclassified to other comprehensive income | (215)   | (9)     |\n| Taxes reclassified to equity                     | 8       | (107)   |\n| Total taxes                                      | (2 314) | (2 730) |\n\n- (a)   Current taxes relating to prior years include a tax income of CHF 8 million (2022: tax expense of CHF 30 million).",

For the Group, the weighted average applicable tax rate varies from one year to the other depending on the relative weight of the profit of each individual entity in the Group's profit as well as changes to the statutory tax rates.",

For the component of unremitted earnings which is expected to be repatriated in the foreseeable future and which is subject to withholding and other taxes on remittance, a deferred tax liability has been recorded. The unrecognized deferred tax liability on unremitted earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested is not significant for the Group as the major part of these earnings is not subject to withholding and other taxes on remittance.\n\n## 13.5 Developments in international taxation\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) initiative to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) has led to the development of a number of measures which countries have already introduced or plan to introduce. These include the Pillar Two initiative, focused on the introduction of a minimum corporate tax rate, with the possibility of top-up taxes being introduced in cases where jurisdictions do not have the minimum tax rate. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in Switzerland and in other jurisdictions where the Group operates. The legislation will come into e/ffect for the Group's fiscal year commencing on January 1, 2024. Certain jurisdictions fall within the scope of the enacted or substantively enacted legislation and the Group has performed an assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.\n\nThe assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes is based on the latest available information concerning the financial performance of the constituent entities within the Nestl\u00e9 Group. Based on this assessment, the Pillar Two e/ffective tax rates in the majority of the relevant jurisdictions in which the Group operates exceeds 15%. However, there are a limited number of jurisdictions where the transitional safe harbor relief may not apply and the Pillar Two e/ffective tax rate is projected to be below 15%. The jurisdictions where the anticipated Pillar Two e/ffective tax rate falls below the minimum rate of 15% are not material for the Group and related top-up taxes are not expected to have a material impact on the Group.",

These balances remain available for use locally.\n\n## 17. Equity\n\n## 17.1 Share capital issued\n\nThe ordinary share capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. issued and fully paid is composed of 2 670 000 000 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each (2022: 2 750 000 000 registered shares). Each share confers the right to one vote. No shareholder may be registered with the right to vote for shares which it holds, directly or indirectly, in excess of 5% of the share capital. Shareholders have the right to receive dividends.\n\nThe share capital changed in 2023 and 2022 as a consequence of the share buyback programs launched in January 2020 and in January 2022. The cancellation of shares was approved at the Annual General Meetings on April 20, 2023 and April 7, 2022. The share capital was reduced by 80 000 000 shares from CHF 275 million to CHF 267 million in 2023 and by 65 000 000 shares from CHF 282 million to CHF 275 million in 2022.\n\nThe current share buyback program of up to CHF 20 billion started on January 3, 2022 and is expected to be completed by the end of December 2024. The volume of monthly share buybacks depends on market conditions. Should any sizeable acquisitions take place during the period of the share buyback, the amount of the share buyback will be reduced accordingly.\n\n## 17.2 Conditional share capital\n\nThe conditional capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. amounts to CHF 10 million as in the preceding year. It confers the right to increase the ordinary share capital, through the exercise of conversion or option rights granted in connection with convertible debentures or debentures with option rights or other financial market instruments, by the issue of a maximum of 100 000 000 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 0.10 each. Thus, the Board of Directors has at its disposal a flexible instrument enabling it, if necessary, to finance the activities of the Company through convertible debentures.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, as well as those of the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants' International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (IESBA Code), and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.",

        "page_content": "<!-- image -->\n\nWe have fulfilled the responsibilities described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements' section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Measurement of revenue as it relates to trade spend\n\nRisk\n\nAs described in Notes 1 and 3 of the consolidated financial statements, revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when control of the goods has transferred to the customer and is measured net of discounts, allowances and promotional rebates (collectively 'trade spend'). For certain trade spend arrangements settled retrospectively, Management estimates the level of trade spend using judgments based on historical experience and the specific terms of the agreements with the customers. The measurement of revenue, therefore, involves estimates related to various arrangements with a broad customer base across different countries.\n\nOrganic growth, which represents sales growth after removing the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and exchange rate movements, is an important component in the determination of measurable financial objectives linked to management incentive schemes. There is a risk of revenue being misstated, through error, misinterpretation or misapplication of accounting standards and policies or intentional manipulation, as a result of the pressure that local management may feel to achieve organic growth targets. The nature of the misstatements may include bias in estimates, unrecorded accruals, or the misclassification of trade spend in the income statement.\n\nWe deemed the measurement of trade spend to be a key audit matter due to the materiality and complexity in estimating the amount of trade spend that is ultimately claimed by customers. The estimates require the use of assumptions that are complex, given the high volume and diversity of trade spend arrangements as well as the uncertainty related to future outcomes, including changes in buying patterns resulting from the current economic environment.",

We performed relationship analysis focused on the change in trade spend as a percentage of sales to assess the level of trade spend by category, and by customer, in the context of the local markets. For a sample of trade spend, we considered if those items were classified according to the Group's accounting policies.\n\nTest of details: For a sample of trade spend arrangements, we reconciled key inputs and assumptions used in the estimates with internal and external sources of information, such as the contracts with the relevant customers or other third-party support. We recalculated the accrual and income statement amounts to test mathematical accuracy.\n\nWe reviewed manual journal entries impacting trade spend to identify significant or unusual items and obtained underlying documentation.\n\nWe assessed the ageing of trade spend accruals. We tested transactions with customers recorded after the reporting date to assess the completeness of accruals and whether recorded in the correct period.\n\nAssessing disclosure: We assessed the disclosure provided in Note 1 and Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements in relation to the relevant accounting standards.",

For all cash generating units (CGUs) with goodwill and for indefinite useful life intangible assets, indicators of impairment are assessed at each reporting date and an impairment test is performed at least annually.\n\nIn 2023, due to increased sensitivity, management has placed additional focus on the Nestl\u00e9 Health Science CGU. The sensitivity analysis is disclosed in the Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe assessment of indicators of impairment and impairment testing are subjective in nature. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite useful life intangible assets is assessed using forecasted financial information within a discounted cash flow model. The recoverable amount is sensitive to changes in key assumptions, including sales growth, operating margins, discount and terminal growth rates. The inputs, including the impacts that climate risks and environmental commitments may have on future cashflows, as well as allocation of assets to CGUs, are subject to management judgment.",

We gained an understanding of the judgements and inputs applied in the allocation of assets to CGUs and recalculated key inputs. We assessed the determination of CGUs and the allocation of assets to those CGUs.\n\nProcess and controls: We gained an understanding of the impairment process and confirmed the existence of key controls.\n\nHistorical comparisons and current context: We obtained an understanding of the current macro-economic context on forecasted financial information and the outlook for each CGU through both external research and discussions with selected stakeholders within the Group. We compared the forecasted financial information (sales growth and operating margins) with historical data. Where the forecasted financial information differed from our expectations given the current context and historical data, we obtained supporting explanations.\n\nWe obtained an understanding of how management considered climate change risks, including transition and physical risks, in the future cashflows of its CGUs. With assistance from our sustainability specialists, we challenged management's assessment and the consistency of potential climate risks across the CGUs as it related to sales growth and operating margin evolution. We evaluated any adjustments made to sales growth, annual operating margin evolution, and terminal growth rates in the impairment models and performed additional sensitivities over these assumptions where needed. Additionally, we gained an understanding of how management used information prepared in accordance with the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework (as described in Note 9). We assessed the consistency of information used, including the scenario's analyzed and the probability weighting used and recalculated the allocation of the potential climate transition risk.",

We compared judgments made and information obtained both at the local level and at Group level for consistency. We assessed and challenged assumptions with reference to information from market research and perspectives from product category, Zone and Globally Managed Business leadership.\n\nAssessment of methodology: With the assistance of our valuation specialists, we replicated management's impairment models and tested the mathematical accuracy. Further, we assessed the appropriateness of the methodology used and the consistent application thereof to the CGUs tested.\n\nEvaluation of technical parameters: We independently derived a range of weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and terminal growth rates, with the assistance of our valuation specialists, compared these to those calculated by the Group and identified differences in assumptions between the two calculations. We challenged the Group on such differences and assessed the discount rates in relation to other key inputs, including whether the uncertainty with respect to future cashflows is adequately considered in the WACC.\n\nSensitivity analysis: Using data analytics, we performed sensitivity analysis around the key assumptions such as sales growth rate, operating margin, terminal growth rate, and WACC. We focused on those assumptions and CGUs that were most sensitive and judgmental.\n\nAssessing indicators of impairment: We obtained management's assessment regarding indicators of impairment and challenged selected indicators based on our knowledge of internal and external factors.\n\nAssessing disclosure: We assessed the adequacy of the disclosure provided in Note 1 and Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements in relation to the relevant accounting standards.\n\nOur results: Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations concerning the valuation, presentation and disclosure of goodwill or indefinite useful life intangible assets.",

The cross-border activity and scrutiny of the transfer pricing applied to intercompany transactions vary by tax jurisdiction. In addition to the complexity of its tax environment, there is a level of unpredictability of tax authority's assessment of Nestl\u00e9's tax filings, which inherently results in the application of management judgment in ascertaining reasonable estimates, which may lead to liabilities for uncertain tax positions being understated or overstated.\n\nThe identification and valuation of uncertain tax positions is a key audit matter because of the significant level of judgment and expertise required to interpret local country tax legislation and corresponding risks. Nestl\u00e9's policy on uncertain tax position can be found in Notes 1 and 13 of the consolidated financial statements.\n\nOur audit response Our audit procedures included the following:\n\nProcesses and controls: We gained an understanding of the processes for identifying, measuring, and recognizing uncertain tax positions both centrally and locally, and confirmed the existence of controls in the process.\n\nHistorical comparisons and current context: We obtained an understanding of the current macro-economic context that may affect uncertain tax positions which are recognized or unrecognized. We validated our understanding of the current environment in relation to other key areas of the audit. Furthermore, our tax specialists, including transfer pricing specialists, considered impacts of changes in tax legislation or business operations in the identification, measurement and recognition of uncertain tax positions. We reviewed available information related to significant on-going tax audits. We reviewed the recognized and unrecognized positions in comparison to tax audits' outcomes, when available, and gained an understanding if there were any deviations in the outcome compared to amounts recognized.\n\nPersonnel interviews: Through interviews in the local markets and at Group level, we compared judgments made and information obtained for consistency.",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\nMethodology implementation: We assessed the application of the relevant standards, including but not limited to IFRIC 23, Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments, in the identification, measurement and recognition of uncertain tax positions. With the assistance of our tax specialists, including transfer pricing specialists, we assessed the intercompany transfer pricing models for compliance with applicable laws, regulations and transfer pricing guidelines and evaluated management's judgment regarding tax risks. We reperformed management's calculations of uncertain tax positions.\n\nKey assumptions: In reviewing the calculations, we identified the key assumptions of identified risk provisions, whether recognized or unrecognized, and tested the validity of these assumptions with our tax specialists. The key assumptions include, but are not limited to, number of years for which the risk occurs, use of generally accepted benchmarks, business models within the Group and availability of mutual agreement procedures in the case of disputes related to profit allocation across the Group to reduce double taxation. We focused our attention on those assumptions and inputs that were most sensitive and judgmental.\n\nOur results: Our audit procedures did not lead to any reservations concerning the completeness and valuation of uncertain tax positions.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law, ISA and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/auditreport.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the annual accounts\n\n## 1. Accounting policies\n\n## General\n\nNestl\u00e9 S.A. (the Company) is the ultimate holding company of the Nestl\u00e9 Group, domiciled in Cham and Vevey, which comprises subsidiaries, associated companies and joint ventures throughout the world.\n\nThe accounts are prepared in accordance with accounting principles required by Swiss law (32nd chapter of the Swiss Code of Obligations). They are prepared under the historical cost convention and on an accrual basis. Where not prescribed by law, the significant accounting and valuation principles applied are described below.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward,\n\nat the rate of exchange under the related forward contract. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are carried at historical rates. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at year-end rates. Any resulting exchange di/fferences are included in the respective income statement captions depending upon the nature of the underlying transactions. The aggregate unrealized exchange di/fference is calculated by reference to original transaction date exchange rates and includes hedging transactions. Where this gives rise to a net loss, it is charged to the income statement whilst a net gain is deferred.\n\n## Hedging\n\nThe Company can use forward foreign exchange contracts, options and currency swaps to hedge foreign currency flows and positions. Unrealized foreign exchange di/fferences on hedging instruments are matched and accounted for with those on the underlying asset or liability. Long-term loans, in foreign currencies, used to finance investments in shareholdings are generally not hedged.\n\nThe Company also uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. The swaps are accounted for at fair value at each balance sheet date and changes in the market price are recorded in the income statement.\n\nThe positive fair values of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are included in prepayments and accrued income. The negative fair values of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are included in accruals and deferred income.\n\n## Income statement\n\nIn accordance with Swiss law dividends are treated as an appropriation of profit in the year in which they are ratified at the Annual General Meeting rather than as an appropriation of profit in the year to which they relate.\n\n## Taxes\n\nThis caption includes taxes on profit, capital and withholding taxes on transfers from Group companies.\n\n## Financial assets and shareholdings\n\nThe carrying amount of financial assets and shareholdings comprises the cost of investment, excluding the incidental costs of acquisition, less any write-downs.\n\nFinancial assets and shareholdings are written down on a conservative basis, taking into account the profitability of the company concerned.\n\n## Property, plant and equipment\n\nThe Company owns land and buildings which have been depreciated in the past. O/ffice furniture and equipment are fully depreciated on acquisition.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions include present obligations as well as contingencies. Provisions for Swiss taxes are made on the basis of the Company's taxable capital, reserves and profit for the year.\n\n## Additional information\n\nThe Company is integrated within the operations of the Nestl\u00e9 Group, which presents its consolidated financial statements under IFRS Accounting Standards. In line with art. 961d of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Company decided to forego presenting the additional information in the notes, the cash flow statement and the management report.",

(the Company), which comprise the balance sheet as at 31 December 2023, the income statement and notes to the financial statements (page 193 to 201), including a summary of significant accounting policies.\n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements comply with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.\n\n## Basis for opinion\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Standards on Auditing (SA-CH). Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key audit matters\n\nWe have determined that there are no key audit matters to be communicated in our report.\n\n## Other information\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but does not include the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements, the Compensation Report and our auditor's reports thereon.\n\nOur opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.\n\nPhone: +41 58 286 51 11 www.ey.com/en\\_ch\n\nLausanne, 21 February 2024",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern, and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on EXPERTsuisse's website at: https://www.expertsuisse.ch/en/audit-report .
