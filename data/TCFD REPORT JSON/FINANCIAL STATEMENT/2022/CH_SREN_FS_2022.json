        "page_content": "## The global economy and financial markets\n\n## Year in review\n\nWorld real GDP growth roughly halved from 2021 to 2022 amid several geopolitical and macro shocks. The unexpected war in Ukraine triggered a global energy crisis and inflation shock, bringing consumer price inflation rates to 40-year highs in the US and euro area. This precipitated the fastest interest rate rises in decades, particularly in the US, which in turn pushed the US dollar to multi-year highs. This backdrop resulted in some of the largest falls in value in years across financial markets from stocks to bonds.\n\n## Global economic growth\n\nGlobal real GDP growth declined to 3% in 2022 from 6% in 2021 due to a combination of idiosyncratic factors, principally the fading growth boost from economic reopening after pandemic restrictions; economic repercussions from the war in Ukraine (eg. inflation, cost of living crisis); as well as the unwind of COVID-19 fiscal stimulus and rapid monetary policy tightening to address high inflation.\n\nAdvanced markets (+3%) grew at a slower rate than emerging markets (+4%). The US entered a technical recession - defined as two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth - in the first half of 2022, which brought US full-year real GDP growth (+2%) lower than the euro area (+4%). The overall euro area experienced positive real economic growth through all quarters of 2022, despite headwinds from the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis.\n\nIndia was the outperformer among major emerging markets, experiencing real GDP growth of 7%, well above China (3%) and Brazil (3%). India benefited from pent-up domestic demand from the post-COVID reopening. China, the world's second-largest economy, was the key drag on the aggregate emerging market growth rate in 2022, primarily due to strict COVID-19 restrictions. Russia's economy contracted by 3%, due to sanctions and other economic repercussions of the war in Ukraine.\n\n## Inflation\n\nThe war in Ukraine triggered spikes in global energy and food prices in 2022, pushing up Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation to about four-decade highs in all G7 countries. Moderating energy and food prices later in the year helped to act as a brake on headline CPI rates in most markets, but other underlying price pressures, such as wages and rents, exhibited more persistence. Inflation forces in areas relevant for property insurance claims, such as construction and producer prices, were even more intense than in consumer prices.\n\nEurope was worst affected by inflation among advanced markets due to its greater exposure to the energy crisis, the lagged response of the European Central Bank (ECB) and imported inflation arising from currency weakness against the US dollar. Headline CPI inflation rates reached double digits across European countries in 2022 and would have been higher if not for government interventions, such as price caps on retail energy and electricity costs. In the US, CPI inflation was more demanddriven and peaked earlier, at 9.1% in June.\n\nEmerging markets faced significant imported inflation from currency depreciation against the US dollar over 2022, with net commodity importers most hurt. In China, consumer prices were largely insulated from the global inflation surge. CPI inflation averaged only 2.0% in 2022 as consumer demand was subdued due to COVID-19 restrictions.",

        "page_content": "## Interest rates\n\nThe era of ultra-low and negative interest rates ended in 2022 as central banks tried to tame surging inflation. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) rapidly raised policy rates by 425 basis points (bps) to a range of 4.25-4.5%, the highest since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). The Fed also began to reduce its balance sheet ('quantitative tightening'). The ECB raised its policy rates by 250 bps (the refinancing rate reached 2.50%), ending Europe's negative interest rate regime.\n\nThere was greater differentiation across emerging markets. Latin American central banks entered 2022 having already commenced their rate hiking cycle in 2021. In Asia, central banks raised interest rates later and less aggressively. In China and Turkey, policy rates were cut.\n\nLong-term sovereign bond yields ended 2022 significantly higher than a year earlier in response to inflation and central bank tightening (see interest rate chart on prior page). Volatility in bond yields was at levels generally only seen in crises such as the GFC and the COVID-19 pandemic. 10-year US Treasury yields surged from below 2% at the start of 2022 to above 4% in October, a level not seen since 2008, resulting in one of the lowest annual total returns from 10-year US Treasury bonds in history.\n\n## Stock market performance\n\nStock markets experienced a volatile 2022 and ended the year significantly lower than a year earlier (see stock markets chart) due to the combination of macroeconomic and geopolitical shocks. A key driver was higher expected interest rates resulting from the inflation shock. This triggered a forceful valuation-driven equity correction, pushing stock markets into bear market territory. Global stocks reached their lowest points in September and October, at which point, for example, the US S&P 500 had fallen 25% year-to-date. Investor fears of a recession weighed on stock market sentiment too. Optimism that central banks might slow the pace of interest rate rises led to brief market rallies in the second half of 2022, but these were insufficient to generate positive returns on stock indices on an annual basis.\n\nAmong advanced markets, the US S&P 500 had its worst annual performance since 2008 (-19%), underperforming European equities (Euro Stoxx 50 -12%, FTSE 100 +1%) in local currency terms. Emerging markets stock indices closed 2022 even lower (MSCI EM -22%, Shanghai Composite Index -15%). Looking across sectors, energy stocks were the key exception, posting gains, while interest rate and growthsensitive sectors such as tech, consumer discretionary and real estate ended 2022 particularly negative.\n\n## Stock markets 2019-2022, indexed 100 = January 2019\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Swiss Re Institute\n\n## Currency movements\n\nThe US dollar rose sharply against other world currencies in 2022. 1 The currency peaked at its highest level in two decades in October. The strength was driven by interest rate differentials, as the Fed raised interest rates higher and faster than other central banks. The US dollar also benefited from its safe haven status. However, roughly half of these gains reversed in the final quarter of 2022, as a deceleration in US inflation tempered expectations of further Fed tightening, and as other central banks progressed their own rate rises.\n\nLandmark events in currency markets in 2022 included the British pound falling in September to its lowest level against the US dollar since 1985, and the euro becoming temporarily below parity with the US dollar for the first time since 2002. In Asia, the Japanese yen touched its lowest level against the US dollar since 1998, prompting the Bank of Japan to intervene in markets in September. While all these currencies strongly rebounded in the final quarter of 2022, they still ended the full year overall lower against the US dollar (pound -11%, euro -6%, yen -12%).",

        "page_content": "## Outlook\n\n## Year ahead economic outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts a challenging economic outlook globally in 2023, with continuing monetary policy tightening to address persistent inflation. The world economy is expected to grow by around 2% in real terms in 2023. Although Swiss Re believes CPI inflation rates are now past their peaks and declining, inflation is expected to stay above historic averages in 2023 and 2024. The energy crisis outlook in Europe has moderated due to warm weather and less demand over the winter 2022-23, allowing gas storage levels to remain unseasonably high. However, China's reopened economy may lead to renewed inflation in commodity prices in 2023.\n\nThe pace of the interest rate hiking cycle has slowed, but Swiss Re expects policy interest rates in major economies to end 2023 higher than at the end of 2022. Swiss Re expects major central banks to begin to cut rates from 2024 at the earliest. This implies that interest rates are set to stay restrictive throughout 2023 in an attempt to counter persistent underlying price pressures.\n\nHigher interest rates are expected to slow economic activity eventually. Robust economic activity in early 2023 suggests that the slowdown, and a recession in the US, could take time to materialise.\n\nGlobal bond yields should rise in 2023, after the Bank of Japan signalled an end to ultra-accommodative monetary policy late in December 2022. That said, Swiss Re forecasts yields on US 10-year government bonds to ultimately end 2023 lower versus end-2022 levels due to the prospect of Fed rate cuts in 2024, easing inflation and weaker economic growth.\n\n## Long-term outlook: the four 'Ds'\n\nWe have added a fourth 'D', for 'Debt', to our '3Ds' set of structural factors affecting the economic outlook, of Divergence, Digitalisation and Decarbonisation. Government measures to support households and businesses through the cost-of-living crisis last year added to public debt levels that were already elevated after spending on the COVID-19 pandemic. Investor concerns about public debt sustainability may grow in 2023 as higher interest rates push up debt service costs, while slower growth could limit tax revenues.\n\nThe ongoing restrictive interest rate policies of central banks to counter inflation could constrain governments' fiscal space to weather future shocks. In a supplyconstrained economy, more long-term investment could expand economies' productive supply capacity. For example, in the energy sector, governments could use investment, incentives or regulation to secure a greener, more reliable and cheaper energy supply after the energy supply shock in 2022. Structural reforms and industrial policy could also help to promote long-term supply chain resilience, in turn lowering vulnerability to future shocks.",

Non-life insurance ranges from motor to property, specialty, personal accident, health and liability insurance. Health covers account for about 48% of total non-life premiums; commercial property and casualty (P&C) about 24%, and personal P&C lines about 28%.\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global non-life insurance premiums increased by 1% in real terms in 2022, below the 3% average annual growth from 2017-2021. Multi-decade-high inflation in 2022 caused insurance exposures to increase, which, together with higher insurance pricing, translated into above-trend nominal premium growth of 8%. An inflationary economic slowdown in major economies negatively impacted investment, consumption and ultimately demand for non-life insurance in 2022. Insurance rate hardening was not sufficient to generate significant real growth in premiums.\n\nPersonal and commercial lines performance diverged as high inflation put cost of living pressure on households. Personal lines premiums declined by an estimated 1% in real terms in 2022 as demand softened and regulatory and competitive pressures on insurance companies prevented large price rises. In contrast, commercial insurance premiums rose by 3%, reflecting generally stronger pricing dynamics, especially in the lines most impacted by higher claims severity, such as property. Motor insurance was particularly challenged by soft demand and Swiss Re estimates that motor premiums globally fell by 1.5% in real terms in 2022.\n\nGlobal health insurance premiums grew by a below-trend 1% in real terms in 2022. In nominal terms, health premiums grew by 8%, driven by the US (+8%), which accounts for 75% of global health premiums. There, the impact of the pandemic has prompted ongoing enrolment into the Medicaid programme, which accounts for more than half of US health premiums. Emerging markets slowed after several years of rapidly rising health insurance penetration.\n\nIn advanced markets, non-life premiums grew by less than 1% in real terms in 2022, below the 2017-2021 annual average of 3%. Advanced EMEA was particularly affected by the war in Ukraine and energy supply shocks, and premiums fell by 1%. Emerging market growth improved to 3% in 2022 from 2% in 2021, although this was still below the long-term trend. China, which accounts for more than half of emerging markets' non-life premiums, drove the rebound, largely due to the recovery in motor.\n\nPrice growth across commercial non-life insurance lines eased gradually in 2022, after very strong increases during 2020-2021 1 . All regions broadly followed this trend, although in Europe and Latin America price rises were steady at around 6% year-on-year throughout 2022. In property, high losses and constrained reinsurance capacity meant pricing reaccelerated slightly at the end of the year, and US property insurance price growth rose to 11% in the fourth quarter, from 8% in the third quarter.\n\nSwiss Re estimates the overall profitability of the non-life insurance industry, measured by return on equity (ROE), at 3% in 2022. Industry ROE more than halved from 7% in 2021 as falling asset prices led to lower realised investment gains. There was also a marked deterioration in underwriting results, as claims severity rose due to inflation and because 2022 was one of the costliest years on record in terms of natural catastrophe losses.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts real growth in non-life premiums of a below-trend 1% in 2023, as expected weak global GDP growth and sticky core inflation impact demand for insurance. However, pricing is expected to strengthen in both personal and commercial lines. Underwriting profitability is expected to improve, but only gradually as claims severity continues to grow. Better investment results due to higher fixed income yields as interest rates continue to rise moderately in early 2023, should also allow profitability to improve.",

Health reinsurance premiums declined 7% in real terms, mainly driven by weak US primary accident and health sales. Demand from advanced markets grew by 1% year-on-year in real terms, while emerging markets expanded by 6%.\n\nReinsurance price hardening continued and even gained momentum at the January to July 2022 renewals. Prices were higher year-on-year for both non-proportional and proportional reinsurance contracts in 2022, which supported premium growth and reinsurers' catastrophe-adjusted underwriting results.\n\nNatural catastrophe losses were above average in 2022 and Swiss Re estimates full-year insured losses of around USD 115 billion. This would make 2022 the fourth-costliest year on record for the insurance industry (after 2005, 2011 and 2017). Hurricane Ian was the single largest loss event by far, with an estimated insured loss of USD 50-65 billion. The category 4 hurricane made landfall in western Florida in late September with extreme winds, torrential rain and storm surge. A series of winter storms in Europe in February 2022 led to an estimated USD 3.7 billion of insured losses, putting this key peril back on the insurance industry radar. Australia experienced flooding in February and March that became the country's costliestever natural catastrophe, with an insured loss of an estimated USD 4 billion. This was followed by numerous small to mediumsized hail and thunderstorms in the US, and the most severe series of hailstorms ever observed in France, with insured market losses reaching an estimated USD 5 billion.\n\nSwiss Re estimates that the property and casualty reinsurance sector (non-life, excluding health) registered return on equity (ROE) of around 6-8% in 2022, which was again below the cost of capital for the industry. Preliminary data indicate a sector combined ratio of around 98% for 2022, the same as 2021, but an improvement from 105% in 2020 and 101% in 2019.\n\nThe mismatch between rising exposures and shrinking reinsurance supply increased in 2022. The inflation surge drove up energy prices and supply-chain disruptions led to a higher claims burden for the industry, while the trend of elevated natural catastrophe losses continued. This is in strong contrast with reinsurance supply trends. Some reinsurers have been actively shrinking property cat exposures or exiting the segment altogether as a result of insufficient profitability, while carriers are actively managing limits, making capacity relatively scarce. A broad-based drop in asset values has been a further cause of the decline in traditional capital.\n\nAlternative capital inflow has been lacklustre since 2018. By the end of 2022, reinsurance capital (traditional and alternative) declined by 20-25% compared with year-end 2021. After adjusting for the interest rate impact of mark-to-market losses for fixed income securities, Swiss Re estimates a decline of around 5%, partly due to natural catastrophe losses.\n\nDespite headwinds from elevated catastrophe losses, inflationary pressure on claims, and a challenging capital market environment, the sector's capital base remains very strong, allowing reinsurers to fulfil their role as the backbone of the insurance industry and to support societal resilience.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nWith the successful January 2023 renewals exhibiting strong rate increases, higher retentions for primary insurers, and tighter terms and conditions, the profitability outlook for the reinsurance sector has significantly improved. Reinsurance industry premium income is forecast to grow by 7% in real terms in 2023, which translates into 11% in nominal terms, mainly driven by increased demand from property lines of business.",

About 80% of life insurance premium income is derived from savings and retirement products, with the rest from risk protection, which covers a range of mortality, longevity and morbidity risks. Europe accounts for the largest share of saving business at 38%, followed by North America (26%). China (31%) is the largest market for life protection business globally, followed by North America (23%).\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global life insurance premiums declined by 2% year-on-year in real terms in 2022, below the 2017-2021 trend of 1%. A cost of living crisis markedly reduced consumers' disposable incomes and impaired demand for individual life saving products in many countries. Stock market declines in advanced markets also disincentivised customers from purchasing new saving products. In parallel, the risk awareness impetus triggered by COVID-19 began to fade away, particularly in markets with higher insurance penetration. 1 In emerging markets, the growing middle class supported demand for life protection and saving products.\n\nAdvanced markets premium income declined by 3% in real terms in 2022. Advanced EMEA and advanced Asia Pacific were most affected as household budgets were more acutely impacted by inflation, and premium income declined by 5% and 6% respectively in real terms in these regions. The transformation of savings contracts in France, and the bulk annuity market in the UK, provided some nominal growth and cushioned real premium declines in Europe. In Japan, digitalisation and ageing demographics supported demand for life protection. North America expanded by 3% as higher interest rates and positive US regulatory developments boosted the annuities segment.\n\nEmerging markets excluding China grew by an estimated 2% in real terms in 2022. The strongest growth was in emerging Asia, at 5% in real terms, carried by the Indian life market, which benefited from rising insurance penetration and positive regulatory developments. High inflation subdued life premium growth in Latin America. In contrast, emerging Europe and central Asia were disrupted by direct and indirect consequences of the war in Ukraine, and their combined real premiums declined by 15% in 2022. China's life insurance industry continued to navigate economic and structural challenges in 2022 and real premium growth is estimated at a relatively low 1%, below the 2017-2021 average annual 4% growth. 2\n\nGlobal life insurance sector profitability deteriorated slightly in the first half of 2022 from end-2021, as measured by US GAAP return on equity (ROE) for major listed life insurance companies. This was primarily due to the impact of COVID-19 mortality claims on life insurers' earnings in the first quarter of the year and stock markets under-performance following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In the second half of 2022, higher interest rates started to improve insurers' investment returns, as portfolios rolled into higher yields.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts below-trend global growth of 1% in life insurance premiums in real terms in 2023, but above-trend 2% growth in 2024. Savings business globally is expected to grow just below 1% in 2023, reflecting above-average inflation and regulatory tailwinds in North America, and grow above-trend from 2024.\n\nStructural factors underpinning emerging markets' economic development will contribute to premium growth in both segments from 2023. Digital adoption along the life underwriting and claims cycle, public support for life insurance in emerging markets and the inadequacy of public pension plans in ageing societies are all expected to support demand for life insurance and reinsurance solutions.",

Ceded premiums from emerging markets accounted for 15% of global demand, with 7% for China alone. Large unrealised investment gains in 2022 reduced globally reported shareholder equity, while higher interest rates improved solvency ratios.\n\n## Market performance\n\nGlobal life reinsurance premiums declined by 5% in real terms in 2022. In nominal terms, growth in the market was 1%. The underwriting of biometric and capital-light products continued to expand. Advanced markets generated 85% of global reinsurance premiums, but growth in premiums was strongest in emerging markets, at 2% in 2022. This was largely driven by emerging Asia. In advanced markets, the life reinsurance market contracted by 3% in inflation-adjusted terms, with the strongest decline in Western Europe.\n\nThe profitability of the global life reinsurance sector, measured by operating margin, improved to 6% of revenues in 2022, from 2% in 2021. However, it remained below the average of about 7% achieved from 2016-2020. Increasing investment returns were a tailwind for the life insurance segment in general, with reinvestment yields above running yields. Overall, life underwriting performance was positive in 2022. Reserve releases and fee income improved technical margins, while a rebalancing of underwriting towards health and longevity products and financial solutions offset some of the negative earnings impact from residual COVID-19 mortality claims, particularly from the US in the first half of 2022. 2\n\nIn recent years, life reinsurers have sought to increase revenues through large, individual risk transfer transactions that help primary insurers to stabilise their income and strengthen their balance\n\nsheets. The introduction of risk-based capital regimes, particularly Solvency II in Europe, has prompted much of this activity. In 2022, the high inflation, rising interest rate environment increased the capital cost associated with the risk of lapses, prompting new pockets of growth for reinsurance solutions. Longevity risk transfer is another growth area. The availability of longevity reinsurance has become key to the pricing of annuity transactions, as insurers offering the said transactions to pension funds typically look to simultaneously access reinsurance capacity to hedge at least part of the longevity risk inherent in these lines.\n\nInterest rate rises and volatile capital markets affected life reinsurers' balance sheets in 2022, leading to lower reported shareholder equity on a market value basis, primarily due to smaller unrealised gains on fixed income investments. Longer-duration bond portfolios were most impacted. In parallel, the impact of higher risk-free rates on liabilities valuation (under SST and Solvency II) supported solvency ratio improvements among the largest European reinsurers. 3\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts global life reinsurance premiums to decrease by 2% in 2023 and grow by 2% in 2024 in real terms (+2% and +5% respectively in nominal terms), as the primary market gradually strengthens and inflation normalises.\n\nEmerging Asia is expected to continue driving global growth, boosted by regulatory changes and government targets, particularly in India, but deceleration in China could slow its medium-term expansion.\n\nNorth America, advanced Europe and advanced Asia are expected to contract again in 2023, but to grow from 2024.\n\nSwiss Re expects further seasonal COVID-19 waves, but operating margins should stabilise as COVID-related claims normalise. The uncertainty surrounding long COVID poses downside risk.",

We have focused on addressing these challenges proactively, all while maintaining our very strong capital position. This has enabled us to take advantage of attractive market conditions at the January renewals while continuing our commitment to our ordinary dividend.'\n\nChristian Mumenthaler Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n## Group results\n\nSwiss Re reported a net income of USD 472 million for 2022, targets more than USD 3 billion for 2023.\n\n## Overview\n\nSwiss Re reported a net income of USD 472 million for the full-year 2022, compared with a net income of USD 1.4 billion for 2021. Four main drivers impacted results in 2022: economic inflation, mark-to-market impacts on listed equity investments, COVID-19 claims and large natural catastrophe claims above expectations.\n\nThroughout the year, Swiss Re added USD 1.1 billion1 in reserves to address the risk of higher claims due to economic inflation across the property and casualty businesses. This included reserves for the current and prior years of USD 1.0 billion in Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) and USD 0.1 billion in Corporate Solutions. These reserves, booked as incurred but not reported claims, position\n\nSwiss Re better for the future in light of the elevated economic inflation rates around the world.\n\nFurthermore, rising interest rates are already helping compensate for the inflation impact through higher contributions from our fixed-income portfolio, which increased by USD 270 million2 in 2022, although the full benefit of higher yields will materialise only gradually.\n\nSwiss Re's Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) business continued to be impacted by significant COVID-19 claims, especially at the beginning of 2022, amounting to USD 0.6 billion for the year. At the same time, large natural catastrophe claims in P&C Re amounted to USD 2.7 billion3, coming in USD 0.5 billion above expectations, net of favourable prior-year development.\n\n- 2 Includes fixed income securities, short-term investments, and cash equivalents.\n\nFinally, financial market volatility impacted the Group's investment results, with approximately USD 0.6 billion of mark-to-market losses, net of hedges, in listed equities, private equity and principal investments in 2022. The fact that the impact was not more negative is due to a successful hedging strategy throughout the year.\n\nDespite these challenges, Swiss Re's capital position remained very strong, with the Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio at 294% as of 1 January 2023. Based on Swiss Re's very strong capital position, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of USD 6.40 per share to the Annual General Meeting (AGM).",

        "page_content": "Shareholders' equity for the Group, excluding non-controlling interests, decreased to USD 12.7 billion as of 31 December 2022, compared with USD 23.6 billion at the end of December 2021. This reflected unrealised losses on fixed income securities of USD 9.7 billion and a payment to shareholders of USD 1.8 billion for the 2021 ordinary dividend, partially offset by the net income for 2022.\n\nThe Group's return on equity (ROE) was 2.6% for 2022, compared with 5.7% for the prior year. Earnings per share for 2022 were USD 1.63 or CHF 1.63, down from USD 4.97 or CHF 4.52 for 2021. Book value per share stood at USD 43.94 or CHF 40.65 at the end of 2022, compared with USD 81.56 or CHF 74.30 at the end of 2021. Book value per share is based on shareholders' equity and excludes non-controlling interests.\n\n## Business Performance\n\nP&C Re reported a net income of USD 312 million in 2022, compared with a net income of USD 2.2 billion in 2021. The full-year result was negatively impacted by higher-than-expected economic inflation and large natural catastrophe claims above expectations, mainly from Hurricane Ian, floods in Australia and South Africa, hailstorms in France, winter storms in Europe and the US, as well as a series of other smaller events.\n\nThe P&C Re combined ratio for 2022 was 102.4%, compared with 97.1% in 2021.\n\nL&H Re reported a net income of USD 416 million for 2022, compared with a net loss of USD 478 million in the previous year. L&H Re's fourth-quarter net income reached USD 0.2 billion for the third consecutive quarter, thereby ensuring that the full-year net income target of approximately USD 300 million could be exceeded. COVID-19-related claims decreased to USD 588 million in 2022 from almost USD 2 billion in 2021.\n\nCorporate Solutions reported a net income of USD 486 million in 2022, compared with a net income of USD 578 million in 2021. The resilient result reflects a robust underlying business performance and strong new business growth in selected focus portfolios. The result was impacted by elevated large man-made loss activity including impacts related to the war in Ukraine, significantly less favourable prior-year development and additional reserves for inflation.\n\nCorporate Solutions' combined ratio was 93.1% for the full year, outperforming the target of less than 95% for 2022.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned and fee income for the Group rose 0.9% to USD 43.1 billion in 2022, compared with 2021. Growth was negatively affected by adverse foreign exchange developments, while at stable foreign exchange rates, the increase amounted to 5.3%. Gross premiums written increased by 2.6% to USD 47.9 billion in 2022.\n\nP&C Re's net premiums earned increased by 0.5% to USD 22.0 billion, supported by volume growth and price increases. At stable foreign exchange rates, premiums earned increased by 4.1%.\n\nL&H Re's net premiums earned and fee income were largely unchanged at USD 15.0 billion, compared with the prior year. At stable foreign exchange rates, premiums earned and fee income increased by 5.1%, driven by growth across all regions.\n\nCorporate Solutions' net premiums earned increased by 2.6% to USD 5.5 billion, driven by new business growth in selected focus portfolios along with the continuous earn-through of previously realised rate increases. At constant exchange rates, net premiums earned increased by 7.6% year on year.\n\n## Net premiums and fees earned Net premiums and fees earned by business segment, 2022\n\nby business segment, 2021 Total: USD 43.1 billion\n\n51%  P&C Reinsurance\n\n35%  L&H Reinsurance\n\n13%  Corporate Solutio\n\n<!-- image -->",

At stable foreign exchange rates, gross premiums written increased by 27.8%. All markets contributed to the positive development. In addition to the top-line growth, iptiQ achieved USD 52 million adjusted gross income in 2022, a 21.2% increase compared with USD 43 million in 2021.\n\niptiQ's earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for 2022 were USD -362 million. The increase in this figure from USD -278 million for 2021 represents continued investments into business growth and definitive, one-off actions taken to position iptiQ strongly to achieve its committed 2025 break even target.\n\nAlternative Capital Partners' activities generated USD 116 million in fee and commission revenues in 2022, compared with USD 85 million in 2021. These revenues are reported under acquisition costs and under other revenues.\n\n## Investment results\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment portfolio decreased to USD 105.7 billion at the end of 2022 from USD 121.2 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates as well as widening credit spreads.\n\nThe return on investments (ROI) was 2.0% for 2022, compared with 3.2% in 2021. The investment result benefitted from an increase in recurring income, although it reflects the decline in global equity markets and the associated mark-to-market adjustments.\n\nThe Group's non-participating net investment income was USD 2.9 billion in 2022, compared with USD 3.4 billion in 2021, reflecting lower private equity valuations, partially offset by the increase in the recurring income yield.\n\nThe Group's recurring income yield was 2.6% in 2022, compared with 2.2% in 2021, benefitting from targeted reinvestments in the rising interest rate environment.

Interest expenses were stable at USD 570 million in 2022, compared with USD 571 million in 2021.\n\nThe Group reported a tax charge of USD 171 million on a pre-tax income of USD 651 million for 2022, compared with a tax charge of USD 394 million on a pre-tax income of USD 1.8 billion for 2021. This translates into an effective tax rate in the current and prior-year reporting periods of 26.3% and 21.5%, respectively. The tax rate in 2022 was driven by profits earned in higher-tax jurisdictions, tax charges from non-deductible expenses, increases in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and increases in unrecognised tax benefit liabilities, partially offset by tax benefits from foreign currency translation differences and prior-year adjustments.\n\n## Financial targets and outlook\n\nFor 2023, the Group targets a net income of more than USD 3 billion, supported by attractive market conditions, an expected decline in COVID-19 claims, higher interest rates and cost discipline. Swiss Re aims to maintain its very strong capitalisation in 2023, with a Group SST ratio materially above the 200-250% target range, given the level of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. The Group also confirms its multi-year targets of 10% annual growth in economic net worth (ENW) per share and 14% return on equity4 in 2024.\n\nP&C Re will move away from its normalisation approach to target a reported combined ratio of less than 95% for 2023; L&H Re will aim for a net income of approximately USD 900 million; and Corporate Solutions will target a reported combined ratio of less than 94%.",

Our portfolio quality continues to improve and has further benefitted from a strong 1 January 2023 renewals result.'\n\nMoses Ojeisekhoba\n\nCEO Reinsurance\n\n## Reinsurance\n\nProperty & Casualty Reinsurance's (P&C Re) result was supported by strong fourth-quarter net income. Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) exceeded its full-year net income target.\n\n## Strategy and priorities\n\n2022 was a year of unprecedented geopolitical and macroeconomic challenges marked by supply chain disruptions and high inflation, a prolonged pandemic and numerous large natural catastrophes. Thanks to a resilient balance sheet and a diversified business model, the Reinsurance Business Unit stood firm and was able to support its clients.\n\nP&C Re's net income of USD 595 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 supported a full-year net income of USD 312 million. The full-year result was negatively impacted by higher-than-expected economic inflation, for which Swiss Re set up reserves\n\nof USD 1.0 billion 1 . P&C Re's full-year reported combined ratio of 102.4% reflected large natural catastrophe claims amounting to USD 2.7 billion 2 , mainly from Hurricane Ian, floods in Australia and South Africa, hailstorms in France, winter storms in Europe and the US, as well as a series of other smaller events.\n\nThe underlying portfolio quality improved significantly in 2022 and at the 1 January 2023 renewals, driven by reductions of peak exposures in casualty, shifting property natural catastophe business away from frequency losses, and strengthening contractual terms and conditions.\n\nL&H Re delivered a net income of USD 416 million, above its 2022 target of approximately USD 300 million. COVID-19-related claims decreased to USD 588 million in 2022 from almost USD 2 billion in 2021. L&H Re saw consistently positive results over the rest of 2022. In addition, the L&H Re result was supported by large transactions, especially in the Americas.\n\n## Strong client franchise\n\nSwiss Re's reinsurance business benefits from global scale, diversified products and a strong client franchise built around three proven pillars: core, transactions and solutions.",

        "page_content": "In P&C Re's core risk transfer business, a large part of the reinsurance capacity is focused on natural catastrophe business. This is a business where Swiss Re has proven expertise to understand risks, such as climate change and urbanisation, and to factor these into pricing. In the core business, P&C Re also continues to build on its deep, global expertise in casualty and specialty lines.\n\nOn the L&H Re side, post-pandemic there is an elevated need for mortality products, while high life expectancies globally require more solutions for post-retirement financial protection. Along with biometric risk, L&H Re will also focus on meeting clients' needs by providing solutions for hedgeable financial risks.\n\nAcross both P&C Re and L&H Re, the transactions teams give clients access to customised reinsurance structures. These bespoke structures support clients' specific objectives around growth, capital management and portfolio rebalancing. The demand for these tailored offerings has increased as clients have sought certainty in a volatile market environment.\n\nIn 2022, Reinsurance established a standalone Solutions division to help new and existing clients enhance their business across the insurance value chain.\n\nReinsurance's solutions offerings include the award-winning automated underwriting system Magnum, the CatNet\u00ae suite and the Rapid Damage Assessment (RDA) solution, which improved Swiss Re's clients' readiness and response to Hurricane Ian.\n\n## Outlook and targets\n\nSwiss Re's Reinsurance Business Unit is well-positioned to capitalise on a favourable outlook for 2023.\n\nIn a hardening market, P&C Re achieved strong results in the 1 January 2023 renewals. Overall, P&C Re achieved a price increase of 18% in this renewal round, with improved rates in all lines of business. This more than offset higher loss assumptions of 13%, which reflect a prudent view on inflation and loss model updates.\n\nP&C Re will move away from its normalisation approach to target a reported combined ratio of less than 95% for 2023. For L&H Re, the impact of COVID-19 decreased over the second half of 2022, allowing for a more favourable outlook. The ongoing profitabilty is expected to continue in 2023. L&H Re will aim for a net income of approximately USD 900 million in 2023.\n\nAs announced on 2 February 2023, Reinsurance will streamline its organisational structure. The current Reinsurance Business Unit will be split into P&C Re and L&H Re, with each having full authority over the respective underwriting and claims management processes. The reorganisation, which aims to simplify structures and improve efficiency and client experience, will be effective 3 April 2023, subject to regulatory approvals.",

Large man-made losses amounted to USD 247 million for 2022, including reserves related to the Ukraine war of USD 187 million.\n\nThe prior-year development was unfavourable, driven by economic inflation as well as liability and motor reserve strengthening, partly offset by positive reserve development in the broader portfolio.\n\nThe net operating margin2 was 3.2%, compared with 12.2% in 2021. This was a result of lower underwriting and investment contributions, whereas operating expenses slightly decreased.\n\nThe investment portfolio performance led to return on investments (ROI) of 1.4% for the full year, reflecting negative mark-to-market impacts on equities as well as a lower contribution from private equity investments.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned increased by 0.5% to USD 22.0 billion. At stable foreign exchange rates, premiums earned would have increased by 4.1%, supported by volume growth and price increases.\n\nGross premiums written increased by 2.6% to USD 23.8 billion in 2022.\n\n- 1 Net of reinstatement premiums of USD 0.2 billion.\n- 2 Net operating margin = EBIT / total revenues.\n- 3 Operating expenses divided by premiums earned.\n\n## Property & Casualty Reinsurance results\n\n| USD millions                                          | 2021    | 2022    | Change in %   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|\n| Revenues                                              |         |         |               |\n| Gross premiums written                                | 23 246  | 23 848  | 3             |\n| Net premiums written                                  | 22 381  | 22 826  | 2             |\n| Change in unearned premiums                           | -455    | -798    | 75            |\n| Premiums earned                                       | 21 926  | 22 028  | -             |\n| Net investment income                                 | 1 756   | 1 355   | -23           |\n| Net realised investment gains/losses                  | 544     | -117    | -             |\n| Other revenues                                        | 20      | 27      | 35            |\n| Total revenues                                        | 24 246  | 23 293  | -4            |\n| Expenses                                              |         |         |               |\n| Claims and claim adjustment expenses                  | -14 773 | -16 344 | 11            |\n| Acquisition costs                                     | -5 359  | -5 106  | -5            |\n| Operating expenses                                    | -1 167  | -1 106  | -5            |\n| Total expenses before interest expenses               | -21 299 | -22 556 | 6             |\n| Income before interest and income tax   expense       | 2 947   | 737     | -75           |\n| Interest expenses                                     | -292    | -372    | 27            |\n| Income before income tax expense                      | 2 655   | 365     | -86           |\n| Income tax expense/benefit                            | -438    |         |               |\n| Net income before attribution of non-controlling      |         | -53     | -88           |\n| interests                                             | 2 217   | 312     | -86           |\n| Income/loss attributable to non-controlling interests | -1      |         | -             |\n| Net income attributable to common shareholders        | 2 216   | 312     | -86           |\n| Claims ratio in %                                     | 67.3    | 74.2    |               |\n| Expense ratio in %                                    | 29.8    | 28.2    |               |\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nThe combined ratio for 2022 was 102.4%, compared with 97.1% in 2021. This reflected higher-than-expected inflation, elevated large natural catastrophe losses and reserves related to the Ukraine war.\n\nThe normalised combined ratio of 96.9% in 2022 was above the target of less than 94%, mostly due to the impacts of economic inflation.\n\n## Administrative expense ratio3\n\nThe ratio decreased to 5.0% in 2022 from 5.3% in 2021 due to lower expenses while premiums earned remained broadly unchanged.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nThe property combined ratio increased to 98.7% for 2022 from 92.2% in 2021, driven by elevated large natural catastrophe losses and inflation updates.",

The decrease was mainly due to market value losses on equity securities as well as losses from sales within the fixed income portfolio.\n\nInsurance-related investment results and foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the figures above.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity decreased to USD 5.9 billion as of 31 December 2022 compared with USD 10.6 billion as of 31 December 2021, due to lower net income and an increase of net change in unrealised losses due to increasing interest rates.\n\n## Outlook\n\nFor property lines, natural catastrophe business has seen significant price increases in a hardening market. P&C Re will continue to leverage these attractive market conditions to improve its absolute margin, increase attachment points and grow in line with its risk appetite throughout 2023. Low-attaching structures are generally less attractive for Swiss Re due to the increased frequency of secondary perils.\n\nThe casualty reinsurance portfolio continues to focus on profitability and selective growth across all regions, while navigating a marketplace where demand and supply are in a fragile balance. Absolute margin has improved across the casualty portfolio, driven by disciplined growth, yield improvements, and prudent terms and conditions. In most sub-portfolios, loss trends are offset by rate improvements. Demand for transactions and solutions continues to provide a solid pipeline of new opportunities which meet Reinsurance's return requirements.\n\nIn specialty lines, there is positive momentum, and Swiss Re continues to capitalise on its leading franchise in these lines with selected growth in engineering. In other lines, Swiss Re will mainly focus on profitability, and will carefully manage accumulation of systemic risks such as war and recession.\n\nFollowing the successful 1 January 2023 renewals and continued positive market momentum, P&C Re targets a reported combined ratio of less than 95% for 2023.\n\n## Premiums earned by line of business, 2022 Premiums earned by line of business, 2021\n\nTotal: USD 22.0 billion Total: USD 21.9 billion\n\n<!-- image -->",

This result was supported by positive contributions from the Americas, partially offset by adverse experience in Asia.\n\nCOVID-19-related claims decreased to USD 588 million from almost USD 2.0 billion in 2021, as excess mortality in the US trended down.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned and fee income remained stable at USD 15.0 billion. Calculated at stable foreign exchange rates, net premiums earned and fee income would have increased by 5.1%, driven by growth across all regions.\n\nGross premiums written in 2022 decreased slightly by USD 0.1 billion, or 0.8% to USD 16.0 billion. At stable foreign exchange rates, they would have increased by 4.2%.\n\n## Net operating margin1\n\nThe net operating margin was 4.3% in 2022, compared with a margin of -1.8% in the prior year.

The improved resilience of the business is the result of disciplined underwriting, a remediated portfolio and restored reserving adequacy, which forms the basis for sustainable future growth.\n\nA key strategic priority for Corporate Solutions is to improve the cycle resilience of the underwriting portfolio. This is achieved through increased diversification into non-correlated and less volatile risk classes outside of large corporate P&C segments, paired with growth in non-property lines to counterbalance the strong relative weight in property lines. The resilience of Corporate Solutions earnings is further supported by a relentless focus on costs and productivity, and increasing economies of scale across sub-portfolios and regions.\n\nA second key priority of Corporate Solutions' strategy is building propositions for corporates, such as the administration of international programs, tailor-made solutions for captives, or risk data services. These propositions offer attractive cycleindependent growth opportunities, increase stickiness and differentiation with\n\ncustomers, and diversify Corporate Solutions' earnings base into fee-based sources of income.\n\n## Performance\n\nCorporate Solutions has become a sustainable profit contributor to the Group. The Business Unit reported a net income of USD 486 million for 2022 with a combined ratio of 93.1%, compared with a net income of USD 578 million and a combined ratio of 90.6% for 2021. The resilient result reflects a robust underlying business performance and strong new business growth in selected focus portfolios. This enabled the Business Unit to absorb lower income from investment results, reserves related to the Ukraine war, and significantly less favourable prior-year development compared with 2021.\n\nTotal large losses in 2022 were of a similar magnitude to 2021. Large man-made losses of USD 389 million were higher than in the prior year, reflecting USD 147 million of reserves related to the Ukraine war, while large natural catastrophe losses were lower, amounting to USD 229 million for the period.\n\nThe Business Unit improved its resilience to future claims inflation, with USD 0.1 billion in additional reserves 1 . The net operating margin2 was 11.0% for 2022, compared with 13.5% for the prior-year period.\n\n## Premiums\n\nGross premiums written increased by 9.4% to USD 8.2 billion in 2022, driven by stable price momentum and new business growth in selected focus portfolios.\n\nNet premiums earned increased by 2.6% to USD 5.5 billion, benefitting from new business growth in selected focus portfolios along with continuous earn-through of previously realised rate increases.\n\nAt stable foreign exchange rates and excluding the elipsLife business sold mid-year, net premiums earned increased 14.8%.\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nCorporate Solutions' combined ratio was 93.1% for the full year, outperforming the target of less than 95% for 2022. The improvement illustrates enhanced resilience due to the strong quality of the underlying portfolio and continuous earn-through of previously realised rate increases. This enabled the Business Unit to absorb additional assumption updates, including for economic inflation, reserves related to the Ukraine war and significantly less favourable prior-year development compared with 2021, which benefitted from low claims activity in 2020.",

Excluding the divested business, the Business Unit's pro forma3 combined ratio was 91.9% in 2022.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nThe property combined ratio for 2022 improved to 72.9% from 80.9% in the prior-year period. The improvement benefitted from profitable new business growth along with continuous earn-through of previously realised rate increases and lower-than-expected claims activity, absorbing less favourable prior-year development.\n\nThe casualty combined ratio increased to 108.5% in 2022, compared with 103.6% in 2021. This was mainly a result of elevated prior-year man-made losses on business written before the execution of the transformation agenda in 2019 as well as reserve strengthening for improved resilience to future claims inflation.\n\nThe specialty combined ratio for 2022 deteriorated by 19.9 percentage points to 96.2%, reflecting the reserves related to the war in Ukraine.\n\nelipsLife's combined ratio deteriorated by 1.7 percentage points to 101.3% for 2022, driven by adverse prior-year development.\n\n## Investment result\n\nThe return on investments (ROI) was 1.4% in 2022, compared with 2.0% in 2021, with a decrease in the investment result of USD 58 million. Net investment income increased by USD 92 million to USD 228 million for 2022 due to a higher contribution from fixed income, reflecting higher reinvestment yields. Net realised losses were USD 61 million in 2022, compared with USD 89 million gains in 2021, reflecting market value losses on equity securities as well as losses from sales of fixed income securities.\n\nInsurance-related derivative results and foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the investment figures.\n\nCorporate Solutions offers insurance protection against weather perils and other risks, which is accounted for as derivatives.

Corporate Solutions expects rate hardening to regain momentum during 2023 as the global insurance industry faces multiple pressures. High inflation and large losses from both Hurricane Ian and the war in Ukraine will continue to place upward pressure on rates to compensate for increased cost of capital. By contrast, as a result of declining market capacity, there is the possibility of an increase in retention layers, which together with a weakened macroeconomic outlook could reduce real premium growth.",

Historically, this has only happened five times in the US markets over the past 100 years.\n\nThe dominant force behind the bear market environment has been persistent inflation across the globe that surged to a 40-year high on the back of post-pandemic catch-up effects, prior monetary and fiscal stimulus and surging energy prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This development forced central banks across the advanced economies to significantly tighten monetary policy at a fast pace, which has in turn led to increasing recession fears, especially in Europe, which was also facing looming energy impasses amid depressed Russian gas inflows.\n\nIn terms of key market developments, global equities started to fall early in January and had entered a bear market by June amid central bank hawkishness and recession concerns. They were still around 20% down at year end, despite some tailwinds in the fourth quarter as central banks started to slow their tightening campaigns, gas prices declined thanks to mild weather in Europe, and China began to ease its stringent pandemic management.\n\nMonetary tightening and high inflation also prompted extraordinary bond market volatility in 2022 as sovereign bond yields surged across the advanced economies. For example, the US 10-year Treasury yield peaked at 4.24% in October, the highest level since 2008, and was still up more than 2% for the year. Short-end rates rose even faster, causing the US yield curve to stay inverted from June onwards. European sovereign yields also rose notably, with the\n\nera of negative yielding debt coming to an end. Finally, spreads on investment grade corporate bonds widened to near-recessionary levels before tightening back somewhat towards the end of the year as risk sentiment improved.\n\nSwiss Re's investment performance was solid, even though the financial market environment weighed on both listed equity and fixed income assets.\n\nThe performance benefitted from an up-in-quality bias, and our increased strategic allocation to private markets also proved valuable. Meanwhile, the increase in global interest rates has also allowed us to redeploy some capital at attractive all-in yields that will help strengthen the portfolio's income resilience.",

        "page_content": "## Investment result\n\nThe investment result was driven by recurring income, partially offset by the impact of the decline in global equity markets and the associated mark-to-market adjustments. The Group's non-participating investment portfolio decreased to USD 105.7 billion at the end of 2022 from USD 121.1 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates and credit spreads widening. The return on investments (ROI) was 2.0% for 2022, compared with 3.2% for 2021.\n\nThe Group manages its investment portfolio with a focus on maximising recurring income. The Group's non-participating net investment income was USD 2.0 billion in 2022, compared with USD 3.4 billion in 2021. The decrease was mainly driven by lower equity valuations, which was partially offset by higher recurring income. The Group's recurring income yield was 2.6% in 2022, compared with 2.2% in 2021, reflecting reinvestment into higher yields.\n\nThe Group reported non-participating net realised losses of USD 3 million in 2022, compared with gains of USD 537 million in 2021. The decrease is mainly due to market value losses on equity investments.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSwiss Re expects another challenging year for the global economy and financial markets in 2023. Global economic growth is forecast to slow from last year, while inflation is expected to stay above historic averages even though price increases have continued to decline in recent months. We thus entered the year with a cautious outlook for global financial markets.\n\nSwiss Re's investment portfolio continues to remain well-diversified across asset classes and regions, with a strong focus on quality. Subject to market developments, Swiss Re aims to gradually increase credit exposure to lock in attractive spreads and yields. Private markets will remain an important pillar of the portfolio strategy and positioning, with deployment to occur as opportunities arise.\n\nSwiss Re will also continue its strong focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations across the entire investment process to help reach its Group-wide net-zero emissions target for 2050.\n\nFinally, the expected market volatility will again require Swiss Re to stay nimble and flexible in its investment positioning throughout the year.\n\n2.0 Net investment income\n\nin USD billions, 2022 (2021: USD 3.4 billion)\n\n2.0 % Group return on investments 2022\n\n(2021: 3.2%)\n\n2.6 % income yield 2022\n\nGroup recurring (2021: 2.2%)",

Swiss Re shares are listed in accordance with the International Reporting Standard on the SIX Swiss Exchange (SIX) and are traded under the ticker symbol SREN.\n\n## American Depositary Receipts (ADR)\n\nIn the US, Swiss Re maintains an ADR level I programme (OTC symbol SSREY).\n\n## Share price performance\n\nSwiss Re shares opened the year at CHF 90.26. An intra-day high of CHF 102.43 was achieved on 3 February 2022. On 12 October 2022, the shares experienced an intra-day low of CHF 68.16. The year-end share price was CHF 86.48.\n\nDuring 2022, the total shareholder return (in USD) of the STOXX Europe 600 Insurance index (SXIP) was -0.1% and of the broader index of Swiss blue chips (SMI) -15.0%. The Swiss Re total shareholder return for 2022 was 1.8% (in USD).\n\n## Share trading\n\nThe average on-exchange daily trading volume for 2022 was 1.1 million shares. Trading volume peaked at 4.9 million shares on 25 February 2022.\n\n## Swiss Re's dividend policy\n\nSwiss Re's dividend policy is a central element of Swiss Re's capital management priorities.\n\nThe Group aims to ensure superior capitalisation at all times and to maximise financial flexibility, growing the ordinary dividend with long-term earnings and, at a minimum, maintaining it. Swiss Re will also deploy capital for business growth where it meets its strategy and profitability requirements and repatriate excess capital to shareholders.\n\nAs announced in April 2022, from the dividend payment in 2023, dividends will be declared in USD to align with Swiss Re's reporting currency. Although declared in USD, shareholders will receive the 2023 dividend payment in CHF converted from USD.\n\nDividends are typically paid out of current earnings and Swiss Re pays its dividend annually. Shares are traded ex-dividend two working days after the Annual General Meeting (AGM). Dividend payment is typically two working days after the ex-dividend date. The corresponding dates in 2022 were 19 and 21 April.\n\n## Dividends\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend of USD 6.40 per share for 2022. The dividend paid for 2022 will be subject to 35% Swiss withholding tax.\n\n## Public share buyback programme\n\nIn line with the Group's capital management priorities, the Board has decided not to seek approval at the AGM 2023 for a new share buyback programme. www.swissre.com/investors/shares/ share\\_buyback/\n\n## Index representation\n\nAt the time of publication (16 March 2023), Swiss Re is represented in various relevant Swiss, European and global indices, including the SMI and the SXIP.

Dacey Group Chief Financial Officer\n\n## EVM performance\n\nDespite the various challenges faced during the year, Swiss Re generated a strong new business result in 2022, emphasising the advantages of its underwriting strategy.\n\nEconomic Value Management (EVM) is Swiss Re's proprietary integrated economic valuation and steering framework, which consistently measures economic performance across all businesses.\n\nSwiss Re reported a total contribution to economic net worth (ENW) of USD -1.6 billion in 2022, compared with USD 3.8 billion in 2021. On a risk-adjusted basis, Swiss Re reported an EVM loss of USD 4.1 billion in 2022, compared with an EVM profit of USD 2.1 billion in 2021.",

In addition, the EVM results include the impact of updates to the internal pandemic risk model and inflation scenarios as well as L&H Re assumption updates.\n\nThe EVM profit on new business was USD 1.4 billion in 2022, consistent with the prior year. The 2022 result was driven by profitable L&H Re transactional business in the Americas as well as strong new business performance by P&C Re and Corporate Solutions, partially offset by large natural catastrophe and man-made losses as well as continued investments in the iptiQ business.\n\nThe EVM loss from previous years' business amounted to USD 4.7 billion in 2022, compared with an EVM loss of USD 205 million in 2021. The 2022 result reflects updates to the internal pandemic risk model and inflation scenarios, L&H Re assumption updates as well as the impact of reserve adjustments for inflation.\n\nInvestment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 896 million in 2022 compared with a profit of USD 872 million in 2021. The 2022 result was adversely impacted by credit spread widening and equity mark-to-market losses, partially offset by outperformance from alternative investments. The 2021 result was driven by outperformance across equities and alternative investments as well as a positive contribution from credit investments.\n\nENW per share growth amounted to -5.9% in 2022.\n\n## Key information\n\n| USD millions, unless otherwise stated       | 2021   | 2022   | Change in %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| EVM profit                                  | 2 058  | -4 126 | n/a           |\n| Total contribution to ENW                   | 3 762  | -1 579 | n/a           |\n| Economic net worth (ENW)                    | 35 374 | 31 107 | -12           |\n| Economic net worth per share in USD         | 122.42 | 107.64 | -12           |\n| Economic net worth per share growth, % 1    | 10.7   | -5.9   |               |\n| Profit margin - new business, %             | 3.9    | 4.9    |               |\n| Profit margin - previous years' business, % | -0.7   | -15.6  |               |\n| Profit margin - investments, %              | 8.9    | -11.6  |               |",

        "page_content": "## Business segment performance\n\nP&C Re reported an EVM loss of USD 738 million in 2022, compared with a profit of USD 2.5 billion in 2021. The EVM profit on new business of USD 379 million in 2022 was driven by profitable new business, partially offset by large loss experience, including Hurricane Ian, flooding in Australia and South Africa, storms in Europe and winter storm Elliott. EVM loss on previous years' business amounted to USD 2.0 billion in 2022, driven by large natural catastrophe and man-made losses and adverse experience updates. In addition, the result was negatively impacted by reserve adjustments for inflation and higher capital costs resulting from inflation scenario updates. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 852 million in 2022, compared with a profit of USD 1.1 billion in 2021. The 2022 result reflects the favourable impact of higher interest rates on a net short duration position and outperformance from alternative investments, partially offset by credit spread widening and equities underperformance. In comparison, the 2021 profit was driven by outperformance from alternative investments and equities as well as the favourable impact of higher interest rates on a net short duration position.\n\nL&H Re reported an EVM loss of USD 3.3 billion in 2022 compared with a profit of USD 53 million in 2021. The EVM profit on new business of USD 1.0 billion in 2022 benefitted from transactional business in the Americas, while the EMEA and Asia results reflect lower transaction opportunities and volumes. The EVM loss on previous years' business of USD 2.8 billion reflected the adverse impact of assumption updates as well as the impact of the internal pandemic risk model update. Investment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 1.5 billion in 2022, compared with a profit of USD 213 million in 2021. The 2022 loss was driven by the adverse impact of higher interest rates on a net long duration position as well as credit spread widening. In comparison, the 2021 EVM profit was driven by a positive contribution from credit investments, partially offset by the adverse impact of higher interest rates on a net long duration position.\n\nCorporate Solutions reported an EVM profit of USD 402 million in 2022 compared with a profit of USD 835 million in 2021. The EVM profit on new business of USD 172 million in 2022 reflects a resilient result, driven by a robust underlying business performance and strong new business growth in selected focus portfolios. This enabled Corporate Solutions to absorb additional assumption updates including reserve adjustments for inflation and a higher-than-expected claims activity,\n\nincluding Hurricane Ian. The EVM profit on previous years' business of USD 231 million benefitted from favourable claims experience variances, partially offset by reserve adjustments for inflation assumptions and the war in Ukraine. Investment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 1 million in 2022 compared with a profit of USD 70 million in 2021. The 2022 loss was driven by a negative equities contribution and credit spread widening, partially offset by the positive impact of higher interest rates on a net short duration position. In comparison, the 2021 profit resulted from equities outperformance and a positive credit contribution.\n\nGroup items reported an EVM loss of USD 506 million in 2022, compared with a loss of USD 1.4 billion in 2021. The EVM loss on new business of USD 160 million in 2022 was mainly driven by continued investments in the iptiQ business as well as Group overhead expenses, partially offset by trademark licence fee income and a capital cost benefit related to the variance between available capital and capital deployed. The EVM loss on previous years' business of USD 125 million mainly relates to terminating unprofitable business as well as adverse assumption updates and experience variances in iptiQ. Investment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 222 million in 2022, compared with a loss of USD 524 million in 2021. The 2022 result reflects underperformance from Principal Investments.",

In addition, the EVM balance sheet provides the basis for determining available capital under the Swiss Solvency Test (SST).\n\nThe EVM framework differs significantly from US GAAP, which is the basis on which Swiss Re prepares its consolidated financial statements. Swiss Re's EVM income statement (and its line items) should not be viewed as a substitute for the income statement (and its line items) in Swiss Re's US GAAP consolidated financial statements and Swiss Re's EVM economic net worth (ENW) should not be viewed as a substitute for shareholders' equity as reported in\n\nSwiss Re's US GAAP consolidated balance sheet. EVM results may be subject to significant volatility as assets and liabilities are measured on a market-consistent basis. As it is a proprietary framework, Swiss Re may change its EVM methodology from time to time.\n\nThe EVM financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's EVM principles and follows largely the same consolidation principles as used in the preparation of the Group's consolidated US GAAP financial statements.\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the reporting currency at closing exchange rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the\n\nreporting currency at average exchange rates for the reporting year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recognised directly in ENW with no impact on the EVM income statement.\n\nEVM follows a closed-book principle and excludes the recognition of all potential future new business activities, including future renewals.\n\n## For details on the EVM valuation\n\nprinciples , performance attribution and differences to US GAAP, please consult our publication:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measuring economic\n\nperformance & solvency at Swiss Re https://www.swissre.com/Library/ measuring-economic-performancesolvency-at-swiss-re.html",

This is supported by our diversified business model and disciplined risk-taking.\n\n## Financial strength\n\nSwiss Re's capital position remains very strong with a Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio of 294% as of 1 January 2023, which is above Swiss Re's 200-250% target Group capitalisation range. Rating agencies A.M. Best, Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) rated Swiss Re's financial strength 'superior', 'excellent' and 'very strong', respectively. This capital strength enables Swiss Re to support its clients while continuing to offer an attractive dividend to shareholders in what have been challenging times.\n\nSwiss Re's overarching target is to maintain a very strong capital position that operates efficiently within constraints imposed by regulators and requirements from rating agencies, while giving the company maximum financial flexibility. Swiss Re's capital allocation decisions are steered to make capital and liquidity fungible to the Group wherever possible, while complying with local regulations and client needs.\n\nAs announced in April 2022, from the dividend payment in 2023, dividends will be declared in USD to align with\n\nSwiss Re's reporting currency. Although declared in USD, shareholders will receive the 2023 dividend payment in CHF converted from USD. Based on the Group's capital strength, the Board of Directors proposes an ordinary dividend of USD 6.40 per share for the 2022 financial year. In accordance with the Group's capital management priorities, the Board of Directors has not proposed a public share buyback programme to the 2023 Annual General Meeting (AGM).",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity\n\nSwiss Re's core insurance and reinsurance operations generate liquidity primarily through premium income. Exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events, and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the Group.\n\nThe amount of liquidity held is largely determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events. Based on these internal liquidity stress tests, it is estimated that Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, the most important legal entity of the Group from a liquidity perspective, currently holds significant surplus liquidity.\n\nSwiss Re also provides FINMA, its principal regulator, with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA Circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers'.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nGroup Risk Management is key to the controlled risk-taking that underpins Swiss Re's financial strength. Risk Management is mandated to ensure that the Group and its legal entities have the necessary expertise, frameworks and infrastructure to support good risk-taking. In addition, it monitors and ensures adherence to applicable frameworks and also performs reserving and reporting activities.\n\nRisk Management is embedded throughout Swiss Re's business. The Group has dedicated Chief Risk Officers (CRO) and risk teams for all major legal entities and regions. These are closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, but remain part of the Risk Management function under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks. They are supported in this by central risk teams that provide specialised risk expertise and oversight.\n\nThe Group's risk-taking is steered by Swiss Re's Risk Appetite Framework, which consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance. The risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk/return view. The risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nSwiss Re's proprietary integrated risk model provides a meaningful assessment of the risks to which the Group is exposed and represents an important tool for managing its business. It determines the capital requirements for internal purposes and forms the basis for regulatory reporting under the SST and under Solvency II for legal entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom.\n\nSwiss Re continuously reviews and updates its internal model and parameters to reflect the Group's experiences and changes in the risk environment and current best practice.\n\n## Swiss Re's risk profile\n\nIn SST 2023, Swiss Re's total risk decreased to USD 19.0 billion (compared to USD 22.7 billion in SST 2022), mainly driven by lower financial market risk. These shifts led to a decrease in diversification at risk category level.\n\nThe increase in property and casualty risk is mainly driven by the inflation parameter update, partially offset by higher interest rates and the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.\n\nLower life and health risk mainly reflects the impact of higher interest rates and the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.\n\nFinancial market risk decreased mainly due to the increase in investment hedges, the negative performance of credit and equity markets, the introduction of the new financial market risk model and the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.\n\nThe decrease in credit risk is driven by the increase in interest rates, credit spread widening and the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.",

Swiss Re's Board of Directors has also defined an SST capitalisation target range of 200-250% for the Swiss Re Group.\n\n## Swiss Solvency Test (SST)\n\nSwiss Re is supervised by FINMA at the Group level as well as for its regulated legal entities domiciled in Switzerland. FINMA supervision comprises minimum solvency requirements, along with a wide range of qualitative assessments and governance standards. The SST ratio is calculated as SST risk bearing capital (SST RBC) minus market value margin (MVM), divided by SST target capital (SST TC) minus MVM. The Group SST 2023 report will be filed with FINMA in April 2023. Accordingly, the information presented on the following pages is based on currently available information and may differ from the final Group SST 2023 figures.\n\nThe below subsections describe Swiss Re's capitalisation according to the SST and the financial strength ratings.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The increase of 71pp compared to SST 2022 was mainly driven by higher interest rates, as well as lower risk due to\n\nadditional investment hedges and lower asset valuations.

For this purpose, the SST NAV is adjusted for the items in the table below.\n\nChanges to the SST NAV mainly include economic capital generation or depletion due to underwriting and investment activities, foreign exchange movements, and capital management actions (such as dividend payments).

        "page_content": "The overall contribution from underwriting activities was negative, mainly reflecting unfavourable underwriting results from Group items and Life & Health Reinsurance. This was partially offset by positive underwriting performance from Corporate Solutions and Property & Casualty Reinsurance:\n\n- \u00b7 The Property & Casualty Reinsurance positive underwriting contribution was mainly driven by profitable new business, partially offset by large natural catastrophe and man-made loss experience, including Hurricane Ian, flooding in Australia and South Africa, storms in Europe and winter storm Elliott. Reserves adjustments for inflation further weakened the result.\n- \u00b7 The Life & Health Reinsurance negative underwriting contribution was mainly driven by adverse impact of assumptions updates. This was partially offset by transactional business in the Americas.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Solutions positive underwriting contribution was mainly driven by robust underlying business performance and strong new business growth in selected focus portfolios as well as favourable claims experience. This was partially offset by reserves adjustments for inflation and the war in Ukraine.\n- \u00b7 The Group items negative underwriting contribution was mainly driven by continued investments in the iptiQ business, Group overhead expenses, termination of unprofitable business as well as adverse assumption updates and experience variances in iptiQ.\n\nThe negative investment contribution was driven by higher interest rates, credit spread widening and equity mark-to-market losses, partially offset by outperformance from alternative investments.\n\nNegative foreign exchange impacts were mostly driven by the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.\n\nDeductions mainly reflect projected dividends (to be paid in 2023, subject to AGM 2023 approval) as well as deferred taxes on real estate.\n\nSupplementary capital remained overall stable as the positive impact of the issuance of three new instruments was offset by market value movements and the redemption of one instrument during the year.\n\nA description of the change in market value margin, which represents the capital costs for the run-off period, is provided together with the SST target capital comments below.\n\n## SST target capital (SST TC)\n\nSwiss Re uses an internal risk model to determine the economic capital required to support the risks on the Group's book, as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity to the different lines of business. The model also provides the basis for capital cost allocation in Swiss Re's EVM framework, which is used for pricing, profitability evaluation and compensation decisions. In addition to these internal purposes, the model is used to determine regulatory capital requirements under economic solvency frameworks such as SST and Solvency II.\n\nIn 2017, FINMA approved Swiss Re's internal model and its components for SST reporting purposes under their revised model review process.\n\nSince SST 2022, two major model changes have been implemented and approved by FINMA:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial market risk: New approach which distinguishes normal financial market conditions and financial crisis situations, improves the stability of the risk measure and better reflects tail market risks.\n- \u00b7 Cyber risk: Methodology and calibration improvements to better reflect the severity of cyber threats relating to critical infrastructure, denial of services or interruption of operations.\n\nModel changes and parameter updates led to a decrease in the Group's SST ratio.\n\nThe risk exposure basis for SST is a projection for the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 and is based on the economic balance sheet as of 31 December 2022 and adjustments to reflect 1 January 2023 business shifts.\n\nTo derive SST target capital, total risk is adjusted for the line item Other impacts as shown below.\n\nSST target capital declined to USD 21.8 billion, driven by the decrease in total risk and in market value margin included in Other impacts (see Risk assessment p. 65 for details).\n\nOther impacts mainly reflect market value margin, the impact from business development over the forecasting period and requirements from FINMA that are not included in total risk because they are not consistent with Swiss Re's own risk view.\n\nThe decrease in market value margin is mainly driven by the increase in interest rates.\n\n## SST Target Capital\n\n| USD millions                             | SST 2022   | SST 2023   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|\n| Total risk                               | 22 739     | 18 974     | -3 765   |\n| Other impacts                            | 7 548      | 2 786      | -4 762   |\n| SST target capital                       | 30 287     | 21 760     | -8 527   |\n| Market value margin                      | 10 851     | 7 835      | -3 015   |\n| SST target capital - market value margin | 19 4 3 6   | 13 925     | -5 511   |",

The Group's exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the organisation.\n\nA range of liquidity policies and measures are in place to manage these risks, in particular to ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7 sufficient liquidity is held to meet funding requirements under current conditions as well as adverse circumstances;\n- \u00b7 diversified sources are used to meet the Group's residual funding needs;\n- \u00b7 long-term liquidity needs are taken into account in the Group's planning process and in asset-liability management.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nSwiss Re's core liquidity policy is to retain access to sufficient liquidity in the form of unencumbered liquid assets, cash and pre-funded facilities, to meet potential funding requirements arising from a range of possible stress events. To allow for regulatory restrictions on intra-Group funding, liquidity is managed from a legal entity perspective. The amount of liquidity held is determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events.\n\nThe funding requirements under stress include:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and collateral outflows, as well as potential capital and funding support required by subsidiaries as a result of loss events\n- \u00b7 Repayment or loss of all maturing unsecured debt and credit facilities\n- \u00b7 Additional collateral requirements associated with a potential ratings downgrade\n- \u00b7 Further contingent funding requirements related to asset downgrades\n- \u00b7 Other large committed payments, such as expenses, commissions and tax\n\nThe stress tests also assume that funding from assets is subject to conservative haircuts, intra-Group funding is not available if subject to regulatory approval, no new unsecured funding is available and funding from new re/insurance business is reduced.\n\nThe primary liquidity stress test is based on a one-year time horizon and a loss event corresponding to 99% tail value at risk (see page 67).\n\nSwiss Re's liquidity stress tests are reviewed regularly and their main assumptions are approved by the Group Executive Committee. Swiss Re provides FINMA with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers.'\n\n## Liquidity position of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (SRZ)\n\nFrom a liquidity perspective, SRZ is the most important legal entity of the Group. The estimated total liquidity sources in SRZ available within one year, after haircuts and net of short-term loans from Swiss Re Ltd and securities lending, amounted to USD 25.0 billion as of 31 December 2022, compared with USD 29.7 billion as of 31 December 2021.\n\nBased on the internal liquidity stress tests described above, Swiss Re estimates that SRZ holds surplus liquidity after dividends to Swiss Re Ltd. In 2022, the amount of surplus liquidity decreased. This was largely driven by financial market developments, including the increase in interest rates and changes in foreign exchange rates, partially offset by positive net operating cash flows.",

The Group thus operates within a clearly defined risk policy and risk control framework.\n- \u00b7 Clear accountability - Swiss Re's operations are based on the principle of delegated and clearly defined authority. Individuals are accountable for the risks they take on, and their incentives are aligned with Swiss Re's overall business objectives.\n- \u00b7 Independent risk controlling - Dedicated units within Risk Management control all risk-taking activities. These are supported by Compliance and Group Internal Audit functions.\n- \u00b7 Open risk culture - Risk transparency, knowledge sharing and responsiveness to change are integral to the risk control process. The central goal of risk transparency is to create a culture of mutual trust and reduce the likelihood of surprises in the source and potential magnitude of losses.\n\n## Three lines of control\n\nIn line with the principle of independent risk controlling, Swiss Re organises risk controlling along three lines, with progressive levels of independence. This approach is designed to achieve a strong, coherent and Group-wide risk culture built on the principles of ownership and accountability.\n\n- \u00b7 The first line comprises the day-to-day risk control activities performed by risk takers in the business as well as in corporate functions, including proactive identification of risks, as well as establishing and operating an effective control system.\n- \u00b7 Independent oversight performed by the Risk Management and Compliance functions represents the second line of control.\n- \u00b7 The third line consists of independent audits of processes and procedures carried out by Group Internal Audit or by external auditors.",

The Group Board mainly performs risk oversight and governance through three committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Finance and Risk Committee - annually reviews the Group Risk Policy and proposes it for approval to the Group Board, reviews risk and capacity limits approved by the Group Executive Committee as well as their usage across the Swiss Re Group, and reviews the risk control framework\n- \u00b7 Investment Committee - reviews the risk analysis methodology and valuation methodology related to each asset class,\n- and ensures that the relevant management processes and controlling mechanisms in Asset Management are in place\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee - assists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities relating to the integrity of financial statements and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements; it serves as an independent monitor of the Group's financial reporting process and internal controls\n\nThe Group Board of Directors has delegated various risk management responsibilities to the Group Chief Risk Officer (Group CRO).

They also support CROs at Group and legal entity level in discharging their oversight responsibilities.\n\nThey do so by providing services, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk management\n- \u00b7 Specialised risk category expertise and accumulation control\n- \u00b7 Risk modelling and analytics\n- \u00b7 Regulatory relations management\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the central risk governance framework\n\nThe Risk Management function is also in charge of actuarial reserving and monitoring of reserve holdings for property and casualty business, while for life and health business the setting of the reserves is performed by valuation actuaries within L&H Business Management.\n\nThe business level Risk Management departments provide the expertise and resources for the control of insurance and operational risks within their respective business scope. The heads of these departments have a dual role, as they also serve as CROs of their respective Business Units, with dotted lines to the Business Unit CEO. Reinsurance Risk Management also performs Group-level accumulation control for P&C and L&H risks in addition to its Business Unit specific responsibilities.\n\nThe business level Risk Management departments are supported by functional and regional CROs, as well as by legal entity risk teams led by dedicated CROs who report directly or indirectly to their top-level entity CRO, with a secondary reporting line to their legal entity CEO. These legal entity CROs are responsible for risk oversight in their entities, as well as for establishing the proper risk governance to ensure efficient risk identification, assessment and control. They are assisted by subsidiary CROs who\n\n- \u00b7 Risk identification and exposure quantification - ensures that all risks to which Swiss Re is exposed are transparent in order to make them controllable and manageable.\n- \u00b7 Risk assessment - enables Swiss Re to understand the magnitude and nature of its risks through quantitative and qualitative analysis, ensuring that the company operates within its risk appetite.\n- \u00b7 Risk reporting - creates internal risk transparency and enables Swiss Re to meet external disclosure requirements.\n\nSwiss Re has implemented a principlebased integrated internal control system to mitigate identified operational risks including financial reporting and compliance risks, as well as risks that could impair the effectiveness and efficiency of operations. This control system represents a subset of Swiss Re's risk control framework and is based on international standards established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). It is applied on multiple organisational levels, including Group, functions, regions and legal entities.\n\n## Risk transfer\n\nTo efficiently manage capital across the Group and ensure that risk-taking in individual legal entities is well-diversified, the Group employs internal retrocession and funding agreements. These serve to improve the fungibility of capital and consequently Group-wide diversification. In addition, the Group aims to maximise the amount of funds available centrally by optimising the excess capital held within its subsidiaries and branches.\n\nSwiss Re also manages and mitigates insurance risk through external retrocession, insurance risk swaps or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities, industry loss warranties or other derivatives. This provides protection against extreme catastrophic events, further diversifies risk, stabilises economic results and releases underwriting capacity.\n\nare responsible for overseeing risk management issues that arise at regional or subsidiary level.\n\nWhile the Risk Management organisation is closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, all embedded teams and CROs remain part of the Group Risk Management function under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks.\n\nRisk management activities are complemented by Swiss Re's Group Internal Audit and Compliance units:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Internal Audit performs independent, objective assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control systems. It evaluates the execution of processes within Swiss Re, including those within Risk Management.\n- \u00b7 The Compliance function oversees Swiss Re's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and rules - primarily in relation to compliance risks - and the Code of Conduct. It also assists the Group Board, Executive Committee and other management bodies in identifying, mitigating and managing compliance risks.\n\n## Risk control framework\n\nSwiss Re operates within a clearly defined risk control framework. This is set out in the Group Risk Management Standards and comprises a body of standards that establish an internal control system for taking and managing risk. These standards set responsibilities for risk takers and risk controllers. The risk control framework defines key tasks, which are the core components of Swiss Re's risk management cycle:\n\n- \u00b7 Limit setting and monitoring - allows Swiss Re to control its risk-taking decisions and total risk accumulations, including the passive risk the company is exposed to through its operations.\n- \u00b7 Risk oversight of plan - ensures that the risk implications of plans are understood and determines whether business and investment plans adhere to the internal risk appetite framework, including risk appetite and tolerance.\n- 1 On 2 February 2023, Swiss Re announed its plans to streamline its organisational structure to simplify structures and improve efficiency and client experience. The Business Unit Reinsurance will be split into two separate Business Units: Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance. Furthermore, a new Business Unit will be formed comprising Swiss Re's global reinsurance clients (Globals), Public Sector Solutions, iptiQ and Reinsurance Solutions. Corporate Solutions continues to operate as a stand-alone Business Unit. The changes will take effect on 3 April 2023, subject to regulatory approval.",

The framework is set out in the Group Risk Policy and consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Risk Policy              | / r e t ur n fo li o   | Risk appetite statement                                     | k e x p o s e s   |\n|--------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Group                    | p o r t                | Risk appetite                                               | u r               |\n| Group   strategic plan   | i mi se r i s          | Target liability  portfolio and strategic  asset allocation | C o n t r o l r   |\n| Annual planning  process |                        | Business plans                                              |                   |\n\nIn addition, Swiss Re uses financial market derivative instruments as well as financial market securities to hedge financial market and credit risks arising from investments and insurance liabilities. Interest rate risk from insurance liabilities is managed through investments in fixed-income instruments whose pricing is sensitive to changes in government yields, such as government bonds.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nIn the context of business strategy and planning, the risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk-return view, while the risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nDuring strategic planning and target setting, Risk Management provides an opinion on the proposed strategy and targets to the Executive Committee and ultimately the Group Board. The opinion focuses on the risk impact of the proposed strategy and the risks related to its implementation. The strategic plan, risk appetite and capital allocation ambition are expressed in a target portfolio for the Group's assets and liabilities, which should ultimately deliver the Group's targeted performance.\n\nSwiss Re's risk appetite outlines the Group's own principles on acceptable risks and provides key directions for risk-taking and risk controlling as part of implementing Swiss Re's strategy: achieving targeted performance, providing liquidity and financial flexibility, managing capital adequacy, and protecting and growing franchise value.\n\nThe Group Board further details Swiss Re's risk appetite through its approval or review of the following key steering frameworks as part of the Group's planning process: target liability portfolio, strategic asset allocation and the Group's target capital structure.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance describes the extent to which the Group and SRZ Boards have authorised executive management to assume risk. It represents the amount of risk that Swiss Re is willing to accept within the constraints imposed by its capital and liquidity resources, its strategy, and the regulatory and rating agency environment within which it operates.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance is based on the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To maintain Group capital at a level that safeguards respectability with clients and regulators.\n- \u00b7 To ensure the resilience of SRZ as the main operating entity from a capital and liquidity perspective.\n- \u00b7 To avoid material operational risks that could subject the Group to large operational losses with corresponding consequences from an economic, reputational or regulatory perspective.\n\nTo meet the first objective, the Risk Policy defines internal respectability limits to ensure that the Group has enough resources to meet capital requirements at Group level as well as respectability and liquidity requirements for all legal entities. These limits ensure that Swiss Re has adequate capital and liquidity above minimum requirements to be considered a respectable counterparty by external stakeholders. To meet the second objective, Swiss Re's risk tolerance criteria include internal resilience limits for SRZ to ensure that the main operating entity is able to withstand capital and liquidity stresses. To meet the third objective, the Group has established a Group-wide risk matrix methodology in which key operational risks are assessed against an acceptable level of expected losses. Any operational risk exposure that exceeds the Group's internal operational risk tolerance is subject to a mitigation plan that is monitored by the Group's Finance and Risk Committee.\n\nInternal risk tolerance respectability criteria for the Swiss Re Group are set out in the Group Risk Policy. The Group and SRZ Boards are responsible for approving the risk tolerance criteria, as well as for monitoring and reviewing risk tolerance. Breaches or anticipated breaches of limits established to control the risk tolerance criteria must be communicated to the Finance and Risk Committee.\n\nSwiss Re's risk-taking is governed by a limit framework in order to ensure that accumulation risk and large losses remain at an acceptable level, as well as to steer the allocation of available risk capacity. The limit framework is rooted in the risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives set in the Group Risk Policy and helps to translate these objectives into concrete, measurable criteria. In addition, lower-level limits are implemented to allocate scarce capacity. The limit framework also allows for risk monitoring and thus supports risk controlling during the execution of the plan.",

It is used to measure the Group's risk position and related capital requirements as well as for defining the risk tolerance, risk limits and liquidity stress tests.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Group's financial risk derives from financial market risk as well as from credit risk. Key drivers of financial market risk are credit spread and equity risk. Credit risk is mainly driven by the credit and surety business and default risk on capital market products.\n\nTotal risk is based on 99% tail value-atrisk (tail VaR) and represents the average unexpected loss that occurs with a frequency of less than once in 100 years over a one-year time horizon.\n\nTotal risk decreased to USD 19.0 billion, mainly driven by lower financial market risk. These shifts led to a decrease in diversification at risk category level.\n\nFor more information about Swiss Re's internal risk model, see the Internal control system and risk model section of the Financial Report available online.\n\nSwiss Re is exposed to insurance and financial risks that are calculated in its internal risk model, as well as other risks that are not explicitly part of the economic capital requirement but are actively monitored and controlled due to their significance for Swiss Re. These include operational, liquidity, model, valuation, regulatory, political, strategic and sustainability risks.\n\nProperty and casualty risk is mainly driven by underlying risks inherent in the business Swiss Re underwrites, in particular non-life claims inflation, natural catastrophe risk, man-made risk and costing and reserving risk. The main drivers of life and health insurance risk are lethal pandemic risk and mortality trend risk.\n\n## Group capital requirement based on one-year 99% tail VaR\n\n| USD millions          | SST 2022   | SST 2023   | Change   | Cross reference information   |\n|-----------------------|------------|------------|----------|-------------------------------|\n| Property and casualty | 12 426     | 13 679     | 1 253    | see page 68                   |\n| Life and health       | 11 128     | 9 310      | -1 818   | see page 69                   |\n| Financial market      | 12 418     | 7 882      | -4 536   | see page 70                   |\n| Credit 1              | 3 198      | 3 056      | -142     | see page 71                   |\n| Diversification       | -16 431    | -14 953    | 1 478    |                               |\n| Total risk            | 22 739     | 18 974     | -3 765   |                               |\n\nSwiss Re's internal model takes account of the accumulation and diversification between individual risks.

Swiss Re has implemented a capital model for operational risk, which is used for Solvency II purposes.\n- \u00b7 Liquidity risk  represents the possibility that Swiss Re will not be able to meet expected and unexpected cash flow and collateral needs without affecting either daily operations or Swiss Re's financial condition.\n- \u00b7 Model risk  reflects the potential impact of model errors or the inappropriate use of model outputs. It may arise from data errors or limitations, operational or simulation errors, or limitations in model specification, calibration or implementation; model risk may also be caused by insufficient knowledge of the model and its limitations, in particular by management and other decision makers.\n- \u00b7 Valuation risk  represents uncertainty around the appropriate value of assets or liabilities. It may arise from product complexity, parameter uncertainty, quality and consistency of data, valuation methodology or changes in market conditions and liquidity. Swiss Re is exposed to financial valuation risk from investment assets it holds as well as reserve valuation risk from insurance liabilities that result from the coverage it underwrites.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk  arises from changes to insurance regulations and supervisory regimes as well as from interactions with regulatory authorities of the jurisdictions in which Swiss Re operates.\n- \u00b7 Political risk  comprises the consequences of political events or actions that could have an adverse impact on Swiss Re's business or operations.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability risk  comprises the environmental, social and governance risks that may arise from individual business transactions or the way Swiss Re conducts its operations.\n- \u00b7 Strategic risk  represents the possibility that poor strategic decision making, execution or response to industry changes or competitor actions could harm Swiss Re's competitive position and thus its franchise value.\n\nSome of these risks are reflected indirectly in the risk model, as their realisations may be contained in the historical data and scenarios used to calibrate some of the risk factors. In addition, output from the model is used in measuring liquidity risk under stressed conditions. As separate risk categories, these risks are an integral part of Swiss Re's risk landscape. They are monitored and managed within the Risk Management organisation, and included in risk reports to executive management and the Board at Group and legal entity level.\n\nAcross all risk categories, Swiss Re actively identifies emerging risks and threats as part of its risk identification process; this includes new risks as well as changes to previously known risks that could create new risk exposures or increase the potential exposure or interdependency between existing risks.\n\nReputational risk is not considered a separate risk category but rather represents a possible consequence of any risk type in addition to the potential financial and compliance impact.",

        "page_content": "## Management of other significant risks\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe Group has implemented an internal control system to mitigate operational risks through three lines of control. This system assigns primary responsibility for identifying and managing operational risks to individual risk takers (first line of control), with independent oversight and control by the Risk Management and Compliance functions (second line of control) as well as Group Internal Audit (third line of control). Members of the Executive Committee are required to certify the effectiveness of the internal control system for their area of responsibility on a quarterly basis.\n\nOperational risk is inherent within Swiss Re's business processes. As the company does not receive an explicit financial return for such risks, the approach to managing operational risk differs from the approach applied to other risk categories. The purpose of operational risk management is not to eliminate risks but rather to identify and cost-effectively mitigate operational risks that approach or exceed Swiss Re's tolerance.\n\nRisk Management is responsible for monitoring and controlling operational risks based on a centrally coordinated methodology. This includes a pre-defined taxonomy that is used for identifying, classifying and reporting operational risks, as well as a matrix in which risks are assessed according to their estimated probability and impact. Risks are assessed for their residual economic, financial reporting, reputational and compliance impact, taking into account existing mitigation and controls.\n\nThe matrix is also used to assess residual exposures against Swiss Re's internal tolerance limits for operational risk. This limit represents the level of operational risk that the Board of Directors and executive management teams are willing to accept. Material risks that exceed or are approaching risk tolerance are reported to executive management and Boards of Directors at Group and legal entity level. In addition, executive management is required to implement mitigation strategies for all risks that are outside of operational risk limits in order to bring them back within internal tolerance.\n\nCyber risk and information security are a key focus of Swiss Re's operational risk controls. The Group performs an annual cyber risk assessment to determine the current maturity of controls; this is based on internationally recognised standards. The results of the assessment are shared with senior management and mitigation activities to improve Swiss Re's cyber security resilience are coordinated by the Chief Security Officer.\n\nOperational events and issues are recorded and managed in a central Operational Risk Management system in order to address the identified problems and avoid the recurrence of similar events. The results are reviewed by the relevant CRO and reported to the company's management team and Board of Directors.\n\nThe pace of digital transformation has accelerated, driven by strategic initiatives that aim to scale up Swiss Re's offering of data-driven services and solutions, diversify the portfolio of products and distributors, as well as take advantage of the opportunity to automate and streamline financial reporting processes in preparation for the transition to IFRS 17.\n\nThese factors, alongside geopolitical instability, have brought into focus risks around key people dependency, information security and third-party governance. Such risks are actively mitigated and closely monitored at executive management level.\n\n## Model risk\n\nSwiss Re uses models throughout its business processes and operations, in particular to price insurance products, value financial assets and liabilities, assess reserves and portfolio cash flows, and estimate risk and capital requirements. Model owners have primary responsibility for model-related risks and are required to adhere to a robust tool development process, including testing, peer review, documentation and sign-off. A similar process also applies to model maintenance.\n\nSwiss Re's model governance is based on Group-wide standards for model assurance. These standards seek to ensure that each model has a clear scope, is based on sound mathematical and scientific concepts, has been implemented correctly and produces appropriate results given the stated purpose. Furthermore, the calibration of model parameters (and the data on which the calibration relies) must be trustworthy, while expert judgments are required to be sensible, documented and evidenced.\n\nAnalytical or financial models that are used for costing, valuation and risk capital calculations are governed by Swiss Re's Model Risk Management Standards. Material models used for costing, valuation of reserves and assets as well as Swiss Re's internal risk model are validated by dedicated teams within Risk Management. These teams provide independent assurance that the framework has been adhered to, and also conduct independent validations. Swiss Re's internal risk model is also subject to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nModel-related incidents are captured within Swiss Re's operational risk framework. In addition, material model developments, incidents and risks are reported in regular risk updates to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level.\n\n## Valuation risk\n\nFinancial valuation risk is managed by internal and external portfolio managers, who ensure that valuations remain in line with the market. In addition, Swiss Re has a function within Financial Risk Management that independently assesses valuations and valuation techniques; this team performs independent price verification for financial risk positions to confirm that valuations are reasonable and ensure there are no material misstatements of fair value in Swiss Re's financial reports. The results of the independent price verification process are reviewed by the Asset Valuation Committee. Summary results are regularly reported to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.",

The framework ensures that there is independent assurance on the data, assumptions, models and processes used for valuation purposes; for property and casualty business and selected life and health portfolios, it also includes an independent assessment of the reserves to ensure that their level remains within a range of possible best estimates. Regular deep-dive investigations are performed into selected portfolios in order to review the appropriateness of both the reserves and the applied reserving approach. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nRegulatory developments and related risks that may affect Swiss Re and its subsidiaries or branches are identified, assessed and monitored as part of regular oversight activities. Swiss Re is actively engaged in a dialogue with relevant regulators to improve mutual understanding of the implications arising from new regulatory proposals. Periodic reports and recommendations on regulatory issues are provided to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level.\n\nThe regulatory environment of the insurance industry continues to evolve on the national, regional and international level. While some regulatory changes create new business opportunities, others come with significant costs and business restrictions. Growing regulatory complexity, increased protectionism and a fragile global economy are persistent themes affecting regulation and the way Swiss Re operates worldwide.\n\nRegulatory efforts are becoming increasingly forward-looking, aimed at a broad range of emerging risks, both actual and perceived. If new regulation is not based on clearly understood risks with a view to materiality and proportionality, and if the resulting requirements are not harmonised with international standards and best practices, this may create an excessive burden for both insurers and policyholders. It remains a key priority for Swiss Re to highlight the negative impacts of market access restrictions or impediments to global diversification towards regulators. At the same time, such risks are mitigated by seeking solutions that reduce the negative impact on Swiss Re and its clients.\n\nSeveral regulators particularly in Europe and Asia, and more recently in the Americas, have developed specific expectations of how climate risks should be managed and are implementing mandatory disclosure requirements. Regulations in different jurisdictions are developing at various speeds, and are not necessarily aligned. Swiss Re continues to advocate for a harmonised and gradual implementation of these requirements in line with international standards, which aim to avoid regulatory fragmentation and ensure that requirements are appropriate. Swiss Re supports the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board Task Force for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) and the goal of the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) to develop a global baseline standard for sustainability disclosure.\n\nSwiss Re consistently advocates the removal or reduction of market access barriers, so that policyholders, governments, taxpayers and national economies can fully benefit from international diversification and therefore from reliable, sound and affordable risk cover and transfer.\n\n## Political risk\n\nPolitical developments can threaten Swiss Re's operating model but also open up opportunities for developing the business. The Group adopts a holistic view of political risk and analyses developments in individual markets and jurisdictions, as well as cross-border issues such as war, terrorism, energy-related issues and international trade controls.\n\nDedicated political risk analysts identify, monitor, and assess political developments across the world. Swiss Re's political risk experts also exercise oversight and control functions for named political risks, such as in the political risk insurance business; this includes monitoring political risk exposures, providing recommendations on particular transaction referrals and risk reporting. In addition, the Political Risk team provides specific country ratings and qualitative assessments that cover political, economic and security-related country risks; these assessments complement sovereign credit ratings and are used to support risk control activities and inform underwriting or other decision-making processes throughout the Group.\n\nSwiss Re regularly identifies and assesses the impact of political risk on its business. The Group also raises awareness of political risk within the insurance industry, and actively engages in dialogue with clients, media and other stakeholders. Swiss Re builds relationships that expand the company's access to information and enhance our methodologies and standards. For example, Swiss Re participates in specialist events hosted by institutions such as industry and risk management associations and maintains relationships with political risk specialists in other industries, think tanks and universities, as well as with governmental and non-governmental organisations.",

        "page_content": "## Sustainability risk\n\nSwiss Re's continued business success depends on the successful management of sustainability risks, thus helping to maintain the trust of its stakeholders. The Group has a long-standing commitment to sustainable business practices, active corporate citizenship, as well as good, transparent governance. All employees are required to commit to and comply with Swiss Re's values and sustainability policies.\n\nPotential sustainability risks are mitigated through clear corporate values, active dialogue and engagement with affected external stakeholders, and robust internal controls. These include a Group-wide framework for environmental, social/human rights and governance risks, the ESG Risk Framework. This framework is used to identify and address sustainability risks across Swiss Re's business activities where information granularity is available and allows for a meaningful ESG risk assessment. It comprises sustainability-related policies - with pre-defined exclusions, underwriting criteria and quality standards - as well as a central due diligence process for related transactional risks.\n\nSustainability risks are monitored and managed by dedicated Swiss Re experts who are also responsible for maintaining the ESG Risk Framework. Risk awareness is fostered through internal training and innovative solutions to address sustainability issues are developed. Swiss Re is also engaging with external stakeholders on selected sustainability risk topics.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information on the ESG Framework and Swiss Re's sustainability practices in general, see the 2022 Sustainability Report, pages 18-21.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nOverall responsibility for managing strategic risk lies with the Group Board, which establishes Swiss Re's overall strategy. The Boards of legal entities are responsible for the strategic risk inherent in their specific strategy development and execution. Strategic risks are addressed by examining multi-year scenarios, considering the related risks, as well as monitoring the implementation of the chosen strategy year-by-year in terms of the annual business plan.\n\nAs part of their independent oversight role, Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit are responsible for controlling the risk-taking arising from the implementation of the strategy.\n\n## Emerging risk\n\nAnticipating possible developments in the risk landscape is a central element of Enterprise Risk Management. Swiss Re promotes pre-emptive thinking on risk in all areas of the business in order to reduce uncertainty and diminish the volatility of the Group's results, while also identifying new business opportunities and raising awareness for emerging risks.\n\nFor this purpose, Swiss Re's risk identification processes are supported by a systematic framework that identifies, assesses and monitors emerging risks and opportunities across all areas of Swiss Re's risk landscape. This framework combines a bottom-up approach driven by employee input with central and regional experts on emerging risk. The resulting information is complemented with insights from external organisations such as think tanks, academic networks and international organisations, as well as from interaction with clients.\n\nFindings, including a prioritised overview of newly identified emerging risks and an estimate of their potential impact on Swiss Re's business, are reported to senior management, the respective business steering functions and other internal stakeholders.\n\nSwiss Re also publishes an annual emerging risk report (Swiss Re SONAR) to raise awareness within the Group and across the industry, and initiate a risk dialogue with key external stakeholders. To advance risk awareness across the industry and beyond, Swiss Re maintains regular exchanges on emerging risks with its clients and continues to participate actively in strategic risk initiatives such as the CRO Forum's Emerging Risk Initiative and the International Risk Governance Council.\n\nThe following emerging risks are deemed particularly important for Swiss Re's business:\n\n## Mental health\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the trend for growing numbers of people experiencing mental health issues. Severe depression is of particular concern due to the risk of causing inability to work, higher suicide rates, increased likelihood for physical health impairment and related healthcare costs. As the contribution of depression to the global 'burden of disease' increases, greater attention is being given to the potential progression from risk triggers and mild symptoms to severe states.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nFor insurers and reinsurers, there are direct implications, particularly for disability claims and cases of early mortality. If conditions remain untreated, affected individuals may develop more severe health problems later in life such as cardiovascular diseases, back pain and diabetes. Preventing mental illness from developing or escalating can thus not only improve personal wellbeing, but also significantly reduce healthcare costs. For the insurance industry, challenges around offering adequate protection for mental health vulnerabilities are as much in focus as preventive measures.",

        "page_content": "## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re advocates de-stigmatisation as key to tackling mental health issues, favouring prevention, early intervention, and continuous mental wellbeing management. Swiss Re has undertaken several consumer surveys to monitor mental health wellbeing in Europe and Asia. To strengthen preventive care and mental health resilience among insureds, Swiss Re partnered with an innovative mental health platform to create an insurancespecific app to help policyholders better track their mental wellbeing and improve links to insurers' support networks, such as therapy providers or employee assistance programmes.\n\nSwiss Re's Life & Health medical underwriting manual (Life Guide) includes support for insurers' assessment of mental health conditions. The manual embraces a holistic and inclusive approach and offers guidance on emerging risk factors like burnout and work-related stress.\n\nTo raise awareness, Swiss Re Institute has been issuing publications on mental health risks. To support the wellbeing of Swiss Re's own employees, a mental health network is maintained internally, supported by awareness campaigns.\n\n## Reliability of energy supplies\n\nThe current conflict-driven energy supply crisis in Europe highlights the fragility and interdependencies of energy supply networks. Long-lasting outage or deficiency of energy supplies can also be triggered by natural catastrophes (eg solar storms), network volatility (eg through volatile renewable energy sources such as wind and solar) and intentional (eg cyber attack or political events) or unintentional manmade events from technical or human failure. These can lead to potentially accumulating disruptions of electric power, gas, or oil distribution systems. Energy supply disruptions become more likely as energy distribution systems are increasingly operating at capacity and inconsistently maintained. In addition, the complexity, diversity and interdependency of energy supplies is increasing.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nA prolonged large-scale disruption of energy supplies can lead to widespread property damage, business interruption, financial market impacts and operational challenges. Importantly, it is likely that business impacts increase non-linearly the longer blackouts last. This could lead to substantial economic losses. Exposure for the insurance industry could be significant, though many of these risks remain uninsured.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re actively addresses prolonged energy supply disruption risk through scenario assessments of the potential business impact. Swiss Re maintains a risk dialogue with governmental bodies, power suppliers and other stakeholders to discuss energy supply disruption risk and potential mitigation measures. Considerations include preventive measures, possibilities for public-private partnerships to create insurance pool solutions and other approaches to improve resilience. Given that future energy storage technologies will play an important role as a risk mitigant, Swiss Re is engaging in raising awareness through the CRO Forum's Emerging Risk Initiative, where Swiss Re led a publication on the subject in 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about emerging risk, see the Swiss Re SONAR report.",

Climate change continues to be the primary focus within ESG, with companies under pressure to address stakeholder concerns about the company's environmental impact as well as satisfy regulators. Shareholder/ stakeholder engagement and reporting, diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI), as well as cyber security and data protection are other important topics that are increasingly coming into focus. Governance, including the transparency and accountability of Board decisions, has been an overarching theme in response to each of these trending topics, with increasing focus on ensuring executive remuneration incentivises the right behaviour. Good governance is recognised as a crucial way to address the promotion of positive conduct and culture in companies.\n\nPages 80-83 provide more information on Swiss Re's governance approach to ESG.\n\n'Good governance is recognised as a crucial way to address the promotion of positive conduct and culture in companies.'\n\n## Sergio P.

A group clause applies with respect to the nominee rules. The Articles of Association do not provide for exceptions, and no exceptions were granted in 2022. The Board of Directors can strike a shareholder with voting rights off the share register retroactively, if the entry was obtained under false pretences, or in the case of breach of disclosure rules (as more fully set out in Article 4 of the Articles of Association). The restrictions on nominee registrations could be abolished by way of a shareholders' resolution requiring the absolute majority of the votes validly cast at a Shareholders' meeting.\n\nFor more information on the share register and the transfer of shares, please refer to the Articles of Association (Article 4).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nwww.swissre.com/articles",

        "page_content": "## Board composition\n\n## Diversity\n\nDiversity is a priority for the Board of Directors. The Board is convinced that a diverse composition is indispensable for a successful and efficient fulfilment of its responsibilities. Diversity considerations with regards to, among others, gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity and regional representation are a priority for the Board composition.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Bylaws require that at least three-quarters of the Board members are independent. Swiss Re defines independence in line with legal requirements and best practice corporate governance standards. On that basis, the Board of Directors assesses its members' independence on an annual basis. All Board members meet the independence criteria. For further details please refer to the Bylaws (Article 3.2, available under the following link: www.swissre.com/bylaws). No Board member has ever held a management position within the Group or has or represents a company or organisation which has any significant business connections with Swiss Re, other than as disclosed in Note 18 to the Group financial statements on page 283 of this Financial Report.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are also subject to procedures to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with an interest of Swiss Re or gives the appearance of a conflict. For details on the procedures please refer to the Bylaws (Article 20.2).\n\n## Election and term of office\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors, the Chairman and the members of the Compensation Committee are elected annually and individually by the AGM for a term of office until completion of the next AGM. Swiss Re has a 12-year tenure limit in place for the Board mandate.\n\n## Nominations for AGM 2023 Board of Directors\n\nRenato Fassbind will not stand for re-election at the upcoming AGM. He is the Vice Chairman and Lead Independent Director of the Board. He has served on Swiss Re's Board of Directors since 2011 and will reach the 12-year tenure limit at the AGM 2023. After nine years of service on Swiss Re's Board of Directors, Susan L. Wagner will not stand for re-election at the upcoming AGM. The Board of Directors proposes the Chairman and all remaining Board members for re-election at the AGM 2023. Furthermore, the Board of Directors proposes Vanessa Lau and Pia Tischhauser for election as new Board members.\n\nVanessa Lau is the Group Chief Financial Officer of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEX). Before joining HKEX in 2015, she worked as a Vice President & Senior Research Analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein starting in 2011. Prior to that, Vanessa Lau was the Chief Financial Officer of Alcoa's Global Rolled Products Group in New York. Before joining Alcoa, she worked as an Associate Principal at McKinsey & Company in Hong Kong. Vanessa Lau started her career in various positions at PricewaterhouseCoopers UK.\n\nPia Tischhauser served on the Executive Committee of Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as an elected member from 2016 until the end of 2021. From 2015 to 2021, she was also the global leader of BCG's insurance practice, tripling its client footprint with leading global and mid-sized insurers during her tenure. Prior to that, Pia Tischhauser led the global commercial insurance and reinsurance business within BCG's insurance practice and was responsible for the development and buildout of its insurance business across Switzerland and the UK.\n\n## Compensation Committee\n\nThe Board of Directors proposes Jay Ralph for election as a new member of the Compensation Committee, succeeding Renato Fassbind, and the re-election of all other members of the Compensation Committee.\n\n## Organisational principles\n\nThe Board of Directors constitutes itself after the AGM. It elects a Vice Chairman and a Lead Independent Director among its independent members. Both roles can be filled by the same independent member. The Board of Directors also elects the chairpersons and members of the Board committees (other than the members of the Compensation Committee, who are elected by the AGM). It is the Governance and Nomination Committee which prepares these proposals. The Board of Directors appoints its secretary, who is also the secretary to the Board committees with the exception of the Compensation Committee. The Global Head Reward is the secretary of the Compensation Committee. In line with the Bylaws, the Board of Directors meets at the invitation of the Chairman, as often as business requires but not fewer than six times a year.\n\nThe tables on the next page provide an overview of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees in 2022, and show the overall and individual meeting attendance of the Board members.\n\n## Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has delegated certain responsibilities to five Board committees. Depending on the responsibility, the Board committees have decision-making powers or act in an advisory capacity. The committees work on the basis of a charter, which forms part of the Bylaws. Each committee provides a report on its activities, proposals and recommendations following a committee meeting at the next meeting of the Board of Directors. If any significant topic emerges, the committees contact the Board of Directors immediately. It is the responsibility of each committee to keep the Board of Directors informed in a timely manner. Please refer to pages 98-99 for an overview of the Board committees' responsibilities, members and key focus areas in 2022. For further information on the Board committees, please refer to the committee charters in the Bylaws or to the Swiss Re website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board committees\n\nwww.swissre.com/boardcommittees\n\nPlease refer to the Bylaws for further information on the working methods of the Board and its committees, in particular with regards to convening meetings and invitation, resolutions and quorum as well as on the allocation of responsibilities.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bylaws\n\nwww.swissre.com/bylaws",

        "page_content": "## Board member qualifications\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures for its composition that the necessary qualifications and skills are represented among its members to fulfil its oversight responsibility and enable sound and independent decision-making. The Board aims to assemble a balance of knowledge in various key areas such as Reinsurance, Insurance, Financial Services, Asset Management, Risk Management, Finance, Audit, Human Resources, Compensation, Corporate Governance and Regulatory as well as regional and managerial expertise. Please refer to the table below for an overview on the representation of these skills in the Board. The mandate also demands significant commitment and availability. Furthermore, diversity considerations with regards to, among others, gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity and regional representation are a priority for the Board composition. The selection of new Board members must additionally be guided by the principles of inclusion, transparency and the avoidance of conflicts of interest.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee supports the Board of Directors with the succession planning at both Board and Group EC level. It regularly reviews the qualifications and skills represented in the Board and aligns them with best practice developments, stakeholder demands and changing business needs. It submits recommendations to the Board of Directors,\n\nwhich decides on the selection criteria used to assess potential candidates for Board membership. The Governance and Nomination Committee initiates the evaluation of potential new Board members in a timely manner with the continued aim to ensure the Board members have the desired expertise and experience as well as with a particular focus on gender diversity. The Governance and Nomination Committee submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for new Board members. It is the Board which nominates candidates for Board membership for election and re-election by the AGM. It aims to ensure that the Board retains an adequate size and well-balanced composition.\n\n## Self-assessment\n\nAn open, transparent and critical board room culture forms the basis for the Board of Directors' annual review of its own performance and effectiveness. The Board of Directors annually evaluates its work and the performance of the Chairman. The self-assessment includes a critical review of the Board's composition, organisation and processes, as well as the Board's responsibilities and duties. In addition, they evaluate if the set goals for the year were achieved. The Board discusses these topics and defines take-aways which are incorporated into the goals for the following year, considered for the Board governance as well as for succession planning. Each Board committee also conducts an annual review of their work against their pre-set goals for the year.\n\n## Board skills, expertise and experience most relevant for Swiss Re\n\n(number of Board members per skill)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n| Reinsurance/Insurance               |       | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c    |           |\n|-------------------------------------|-------|-----------|-----------|\n| Financial Services/Asset Management |       | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c |           |\n| Risk Management/Finance/Audit       |       |           | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c |\n| Human Resources/Compensation        |       | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c     |           |\n| Corporate Governance/Regulatory     |       | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c   |           |\n| Regional experience                 |       | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c   |           |\n| CEO experience                      | \uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c\uf06c |           |           |\n\n## Board members' training\n\nIn a fast-paced ever-challenging environment, keeping up with new developments and advancing its knowledge and insights is key for the Board of Directors. Educational sessions and deep dives form an integral part of the Board's agenda each year. Each Board member also has the opportunity to have individual educational sessions at any time with key executives and experts on specific topics of interest and value. In 2022, the Board focused on learning more about the planned adoption of IFRS in 2024, Swiss Re's Group Sustainability Strategy and the revised Swiss Re compensation framework, as well as on gaining additional insights into the L&H reserving methodology. The onboarding programme for new Board members is an established set of training and materials aimed at ensuring that incoming Board members have a comprehensive overview of the Group's organisation, business and environment. The onboarding programme also includes sessions which are individually tailored to a new Board member's needs.",

GIA's continuous risk assessment process (which utilises data analytics and external data factors) drives the allocation of GIA's resources, the audit proposals and prioritisation. GIA continuously extends the use of data analytics and automation within its audit processes. GIA aspires to be critical thinkers who lead from every seat, challenge the status quo, understand risk and demonstrate that they are responsive to risk.\n\nQuarterly, the Head of GIA submits to the Audit Committee and relevant legal entity audit committees GIA's risk-based Audit Plan for the upcoming quarter for approval. Any significant deviation from the formally approved Audit Plan must be communicated to the Audit Committee and relevant legal entity audit committees through progress reports. The Head of GIA provides all written audit reports, identifying issues and management actions, to the Audit Committee, relevant legal entity audit committees, senior management and Swiss Re's external auditor on a regular basis. GIA monitors and verifies that management's actions have been effectively implemented. Significant issues, and issues that have not been effectively corrected, are highlighted to the Audit Committee and relevant legal entity audit committees.\n\n## Board of Directors and Group EC compensation\n\nPlease refer to the Compensation Report beginning on page 116 of this Financial Report for information on compensation of and shareholding programmes for the Board of Directors and Group EC members (including authorities and procedures for determining the same, pages 123-124) as well as for loans granted to them (pages 127 and 135) and for provisions of the Articles of Association relating to these matters (page 123).",

At the AGM on 13 April 2022, the shareholders re-elected KPMG, Zurich, as the external auditor for Swiss Re Ltd and the Swiss Re Group, for a one-year term of office, for the financial year 2023. KPMG had initially been elected as Swiss Re's external auditor for the financial year 2021. KPMG fully meets the strict requirements of Swiss Re. The Audit Committee has received confirmation from KPMG that it complies with the relevant independence requirements to exercise the mandate as Swiss Re's external auditor.\n\nFrank Pfaffenzeller and Eric Elman have served as KPMG's lead auditors since KPMG took office in 2021. In line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and to foster external auditor independence, each of the two lead auditors rotates out of his or her role after seven years.\n\nUnlike in the European Union, there is no law in Switzerland that provides for a mandatory rotation of the external auditor after a certain number of years. The Audit Committee closely monitors related regulatory developments in the EU and elsewhere.\n\n## Supervision of the external audit process\n\nThe external auditor is accountable to the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors and ultimately to the shareholders. The Board of Directors reviews the external auditor's professional qualifications. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight. The Audit Committee liaises closely with the external auditor. The lead auditors participate as advisors at all Audit Committee meetings (for more information, see page 97). The Audit Committee reviews and approves all planned audit services and any non-audit services provided by the external auditor. It discusses the results of annual audits with the external auditor, including reports on the financial statements, necessary changes to the audit plans and critical accounting policies. The external auditor shares with the Audit Committee its findings on the adequacy of the financial reporting process and the efficacy of the internal controls. It informs the Audit Committee about any differences of opinion between the external auditor and management encountered during the audits or in connection with the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Fees paid to the auditor\n\nThe fees (excluding value added tax) for professional services provided by KPMG in 2022 were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                        | 2021   |   2022* |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|\n| Audit fees                                          | 21.2   |    27.5 |\n| Non-audit fees                                      | 1.5    |     6.4 |\n| Audit-related assurance services                    | 0.4    |     5.5 |\n| Services relating to corporate finance transactions | -      |     0.3 |\n| Tax-related services                                | 0.2    |     0.1 |\n| Other non-audit services                            | 0.9    |     0.5 |\n| Total fees                                          | 22.7   |    33.9 |\n\n- *  In 2022, audit fees also included local IFRS audit preparation activities. Audit-related assurance services primarily comprised pre-audit work related to the Group IFRS implementation as well as mandates required by Swiss Re's regulators. Services relating to corporate finance transactions consisted of comfort letters for Swiss Re's debt issuance programme and other non-audit services mainly covered control assessments and sustainability report reviews.",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of the external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for recommending an audit firm to the Board of Directors for election by the shareholders. In order to be able to select and propose an audit firm for its election proposal to the shareholders and in line with good corporate governance, the Audit Committee thoroughly evaluates the credentials of the external auditor annually based on the following key criteria: investment in the client relationship, quality of delivery, quality of the people and services and focus on client value. The Audit Committee presents the findings of the evaluation to the Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's assessment of the external auditor is furthermore based on the external auditor's qualifications, independence and performance. The Audit Committee also evaluates the performance of the lead auditors annually.\n\n## Qualifications\n\nThe external auditor submits, at least once a year, a report to the Audit Committee describing its own quality control, including any material issues raised by its most recent internal reviews or inquiries or investigations by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years, as well as any steps taken to deal with any such issues.\n\n## Independence\n\nAt least once a year, the external auditor provides a formal written statement delineating all relationships with Swiss Re that might affect its independence. Any disclosed relationships or services that might interfere with the external auditor's objectivity and independence are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which then recommends appropriate action to be taken by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Performance\n\nThis assessment measures the external auditor's performance against a number of criteria, including understanding of Swiss Re's business; technical knowledge and expertise; comprehensiveness of the audit plans; quality of the working relationship with management and clarity of communication. It is compiled based on the input of key people involved in the financial reporting process and the observations of the Audit Committee members.\n\nKPMG provided reports on selected topics at each of the Audit Committee meetings during the reporting year 2022.

The Compensation Committee's activities included:\n\n- \u00b7 Implementing changes to the Swiss Re incentive compensation framework as decided in 2021 and announced in the 2021 Compensation Report for the performance year 2022. These changes further foster a pay-for-performance culture and effectively align stakeholder interests, and include:\n- i)   a revised process for funding the Group Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool, with a stronger focus on financial performance;\n\n- ii)  replacing the cash-based deferral plan (Value Alignment Incentive/VAI) with a share-based deferral plan (Deferred Share Plan/DSP) for which first awards are to be granted in April 2023; and\n- iii) aligning Return on Equity (ROE) targets with externally communicated targets as well as implementing a broader vesting range on the relative Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance condition for the Leadership Share Plan (LSP).\n\nThese changes have no impact on running awards. Further details of all three plans can be found in the section Group compensation framework, 2022 outcomes and 2023 changes.\n\n- \u00b7 Driving performance differentiation and application of pay-for-performance principles at business and individual level to ensure proper recognition of performance.\n- \u00b7 Enforcing commitment to equal pay for equal work that is supported by a gender-neutral approach to determining pay for all roles (at all levels throughout the year and across the employee life cycle).\n- \u00b7 Ensuring the integration of sustainability/ ESG considerations in the compensation framework as one of the drivers of variable cash compensation.\n- \u00b7 Evaluating the impact of the change from US GAAP to IFRS and discontinuation of EVM on incentive plans (specifically running VAI and LSP plans) with decisions for these plans to be taken during 2023.\n- \u00b7 Alleviating the financial burden of soaring economic inflation and rising cost of living by providing a one-off payment to those who were relatively hit the hardest, which represents almost half of Swiss Re's employees. No such payment was made to senior management or executives.",

        "page_content": "## 2022 Group business results and pay for performance\n\nThe compensation framework aims to promote sustainable performance and long-term shareholder value creation through key performance measures and equitybased compensation. For 2022, Swiss Re's commitment to pay for performance translated into the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 Overall performance : Compensation decisions were made considering Swiss Re's overall performance for the reporting year in which Swiss Re reported a US GAAP net income of USD 472 million and ROE of 2.6%, whereas the Economic Net Worth (ENW) per share growth was at -5.9%. The Group's US GAAP and economic performance declined compared with 2021, mainly driven by the impact of economic inflation on actual and expected claims in property and casualty businesses, mark-to-market impacts on listed equity investments and large natural catastrophe claims above expectations. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) reported a net income of USD 312 million, negatively impacted by higher-than-expected economic inflation, as well as by large natural catastrophe claims above expectations. Nevertheless, P&C Re grew its net premiums earned by 4.1% at stable foreign exchange rates, supported by continued price improvements over the year. P&C Re's normalised combined ratio of 96.9% missed its target of less than 94%. On the EVM side, P&C Re was also impacted by the capital cost parameter update for inflation. Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) reported a net income of USD 416 million, above its target net income of approximately USD 300 million. L&H Re returned to profitability despite COVID-19related claims of USD 588 million. The economic performance of L&H Re reflects the adverse impact of assumption updates as well as the impact of the internal pandemic risk model update. Corporate Solutions reported a net income of USD 486 million, reflecting the solid underlying business performance as a result of the strong portfolio quality and new business growth in selected focus portfolios. With a combined ratio of 93.1% for the full year, Corporate Solutions outperformed its target of less than 95.0% in 2022.\n- \u00b7 Annual bonus : 2022 was a challenging year, marked by the war in Ukraine, surging economic inflation, the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic and elevated natural catastrophe losses. The Group missed two of its five Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) relevant for the Group API pool. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors did not exercise any upward or downward discretion. The Group Business Performance Factor decreased from 0.92 to 0.68 for financial year 2022, which led to an overall decrease of the Group API pool by 28.1% compared with 2021. For the Group Executive Committee (Group EC) members, the aggregate API amount (as disclosed) decreased by 42.5% compared with the prior year, reflecting their accountability for the financial results.\n- \u00b7 Deferred compensation : The VAI 2019 (awarded 2020) performance factor for the Swiss Re Group was 92.8% based on the average 2020-2022 previous years' business performance. The main drivers of the previous years' business losses were COVID-19-related losses, natural catastrophe and man-made losses as well as reserve increases relating to economic inflation. The previous years' business performance further deteriorated due to 2022 updates to the internal pandemic risk model and inflation scenarios.\n- \u00b7 Long-term incentive: Outcomes for the Leadership Performance Plan (LPP) 2020 (vesting in March 2023) were below target for the three-year performance period with a combined performance factor of 14.5%.\n\n## Shareholder engagement and Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe compensation framework and decisions continued to receive strong support from shareholders. At the AGM on 13 April 2022, shareholders approved all binding compensation-related motions and the 2021 Compensation Report was approved in a consultative vote.\n\nSwiss Re continued to engage directly with shareholders and proxy advisors, such as during the annual Chairman's Roadshow. Swiss Re's compensation framework (including potential changes to the framework), compensation-related decisions and the compensation disclosure approach were discussed. Further details on shareholder engagement are provided in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 80 and 114.\n\nThe Compensation Committee decided to disclose the weightings of the non-financial KPIs in the Group CEO scorecard presented in this Compensation Report. The Compensation Committee is grateful for the fruitful engagement and continues to proactively consider shareholders and proxy advisors' expectations.\n\nConsistent with last year and in line with Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, shareholders will be asked to vote on the following motions at the AGM 2023:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2023 to the AGM 2024.\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation and variable long-term compensation for the members of the Group EC for the financial year 2024.\n- \u00b7 Aggregate amount of variable short-term compensation for the members of the Group EC for the financial year 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the Compensation Report will be submitted to the shareholders for a consultative vote.\n\nThis Compensation Report complies with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Articles 14 to 16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies limited by Shares.\n\n16 March 2023\n\nJacques de Vaucleroy Chair Compensation Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Swiss Re has a non-discriminatory approach to determining compensation and benefits at all levels. Key pillars of the approach are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSound governance around compensation decision-making and approvals to ensure appropriate checks and balances.\n\nCompensation ranges defined by job family or specialisation in the local market, which ensure that compensation for employees in the same country/location is set based on consistent benchmarks.\n\nAnnual review of individual salaries and target incentives to maintain internal pay equity and pay for performance.\n\nRegular statistical analysis using best practice methodologies to identify and address potential risks of bias.\n\nAn inclusive and diverse workforce is critical to the success of the business. Pay equity reviews are conducted regularly with a focus on an 'adjusted gender pay gap' comparing pay for people in similar roles, in the same country, at the same hierarchical level and with similar years of experience. During the most recent review conducted in April 2022, this measure did not reveal any systemic bias: globally, the adjusted pay gap between men and women stood at 1.7% on average (same as last year). In addition, line managers have self-service dashboards available to analyse compensation for their teams. For Swiss Re's larger locations (covering about 80% of all employees), regular statistical analysis is carried out to identify and address any potential risks of bias in compensation setting.\n\nThe revised Swiss Federal Act on Gender Equality requires companies such as Swiss Re to complete an equal pay analysis and have the results verified by an independent external auditor. The audit that was completed in spring 2022 concluded that Swiss Re is compliant across all legal entities and achieved the legal requirements set forth by the Swiss government. The result of this audit reaffirmed Swiss Re's commitment to equal pay.\n\nMore details on Swiss Re's initiatives fostering diversity are provided in the Sustainability Report available at www.swissre.com/sustainability.\n\n## Spotlight: strong link between compensation and performance against sustainability/environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets\n\nSustainability/ESG is one of the drivers for compensation outcomes as Swiss Re considers defined sustainability criteria for all Business Units/Group Functions within the annual bonus allocation. Unlike long-term variable compensation that applies only to selected participants, sustainability-related performance impacts compensation for all employees, including the Group EC, through the annual bonus. Additionally, some employees have sustainability/ESG targets set at an individual level where this aligns to their role and responsibilities. Key considerations for the sustainability target-setting process are shown in the figure below.\n\n## Sustainability targets in compensation\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Compensation philosophy and governance\n\n## Guiding principles of Swiss Re's compensation framework\n\nSwiss Re's compensation framework is designed to reflect the nature of its business by:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing a culture of sustainable performance with a focus on risk-adjusted financial results.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring alignment of compensation to long-term business results and individual contribution, and recognising both what was achieved and how it was achieved.\n- \u00b7 Attracting, motivating and retaining the qualified talent the Group needs to succeed globally.\n- \u00b7 Supporting Swiss Re's commitment to ensure equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.\n- \u00b7 Aligning the interests of employees with those of Swiss Re's shareholders and society at large.\n- \u00b7 Fostering compliance, supporting appropriate and controlled risk-taking in line with Swiss Re's business and risk strategy, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nSwiss Re's total compensation is well balanced in terms of fixed versus variable compensation and short-term versus long-term incentives. This encourages sustainable long-term performance and supports shareholder alignment. Complemented by pension plans and benefits, the total reward package is competitive in local labour markets.\n\n## Compensation Policy\n\nBuilding on the overarching compensation principles included in Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, the compensation framework is captured within the Swiss Re Group Compensation Policy (Compensation Policy). The Compensation Policy is implemented globally to the extent possible. Variations may apply at the regional, entity and Business Unit (including Division iptiQ) level to accommodate specific requirements, such as compliance with local regulations and talent management. The Compensation Policy governs the compensation structure and processes and is regularly reviewed by Human Resources, Risk Management and the Compensation Committee against FINMA requirements and further relevant regulations as appropriate.\n\n## Approval authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation at the Board of Directors and Group EC level is governed by Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, which include rules on:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual and binding approval by the AGM of the maximum aggregate amounts of compensation of members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC (Article 22).\n- \u00b7 The supplementary amount for changes in the Group EC if the maximum aggregate amount of compensation approved by the AGM is not sufficient to also cover compensation of a new Group EC member (Article 23).\n- \u00b7 The compensation principles for both the members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC covering short-term and long-term elements, performancerelated pay, payment in shares, financial instruments or units, compensation in kind or other types of benefits (Article 24).\n- \u00b7 The agreements with members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC, external mandates and credits and loans (Articles 25 to 27).\n\nSwiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association are complemented by stringent governance on compensation matters set out in the Bylaws of Swiss Re Ltd and in the Bylaws of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, including the Charter of the Compensation Committee. Authority levels are summarised in the table overleaf.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved an authority matrix that defines the limits to which each level of management can authorise compensation payments. The Group CEO, the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, approve all compensation that exceeds the pre-set limits. The Group CEO is not involved in decision-making concerning his own compensation. The Board of Directors also establishes and periodically reviews Swiss Re's compensation framework (including guidelines and performance criteria) and prepares the compensationrelated proposals to the AGM.\n\nFurther details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 76-115 and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/articles and www.swissre.com/bylaws.",

It operates as the Group's compensation committee and oversees the compensation framework applied at all entities of the Swiss Re Group. In 2022, the Compensation Committee consisted of five independent members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has an annual agenda to ensure that important reviews take place at the right times throughout the year, including the oversight of each stage of the compensation cycle. The Compensation Committee also commits time to executive sessions and conducts a periodic self-evaluation to preserve its high level of effectiveness.\n\nDuring 2022, the Compensation Committee held six meetings and provided updates to the Board of Directors on topics discussed, decisions made and items for approval after each of these meetings. In addition, the Compensation Committee passed four decisions by circular resolution.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Group CEO and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services participate in the Compensation Committee meetings. Other members of senior management may attend as deemed appropriate and upon invitation by the Chair of the Compensation Committee. Management members do not attend when their own compensation is discussed. The Global Head Reward serves as the Secretary to the Compensation Committee and attends its meetings (excluding the executive sessions).\n\nFurther details on the Compensation Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance Report (page 97 and page 99) and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/bylaws, including the\n\nCharter of the Compensation Committee.",

PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd advised on topics including remuneration trends, (executive) compensation, market intelligence and best practices, while also participating in the Compensation Committee meetings. In addition, Mercer delivered compensation benchmarking data and Niederer Kraft Frey Ltd gave legal advice, mainly about specific aspects of executive compensation and labour law, regulatory compliance, plan rules and disclosure matters. The advisors may also have other mandates with Swiss Re. The Compensation Committee reviews the external advisors' role and mandate on a regular basis.\n\n## Additional safeguards in governing compensation: Control Functions and key risk takers\n\nSwiss Re bears risks in the course of its business activities, including market, credit and liquidity, underwriting, operational (including legal and compliance) and reputational risk. Group Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit annually perform an independent assessment of risk- and control-related behaviours of the Group and each of the Business Units/Group Functions, and of Swiss Re's Key Risk Takers individually. These reports are delivered to key executives including the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services. The risk- and control-related behaviour assessment of Group and Business Units/ Group Functions provides additional input to determine the Group Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool and its allocation to each Business Unit/Group Function. The assessment results of each Key Risk Taker serve as additional input when considering individual performance and compensation outcomes.\n\nTo ensure meaningful assessments and the continued independence of Control Functions (defined as Group Risk Management, Compliance, Group Internal Audit and Appointed Actuaries), the aggregate API pool for each Control Function and individual compensation for the Head of the respective Control Function are approved at Board level.\n\n## Prohibition of personal hedging strategies\n\nAny use of personal hedging strategies or remuneration and liability-related insurance that could undermine the risk alignment effects and economic exposure embedded in compensation arrangements is prohibited.",

Benchmarking is conducted against the same peer group used for the Group EC benchmarking (for further information on the peer group, please refer to page 130 of this Compensation Report) and against Swiss Market Index companies.\n\nA minimum Swiss pension fund solution is provided to members of the Board of Directors who are not exempted from mandatory occupational benefit plans in Switzerland. This is offered by an established external provider and applies only to a limited number of individuals depending on their personal situation due to which local law imposes such a pension solution. Pension contributions are split equally between Swiss Re and the respective individual. Contributions made by Swiss Re are included in the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval.\n\n## Changes to Board fees\n\nNo changes to Board of Directors fees have been made since 2018. Fee levels vary to reflect roles, responsibilities and time commitment, for instance due to committee memberships that differ in meeting frequency or duration. Fees for individuals may differ year on year, reflecting role changes (eg assuming the Chair position on a committee or joining a different committee in the reported financial year) or FX rate developments for fees not delivered in CHF (eg subsidiary board fees).\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nThe majority of the board members at subsidiary level are Swiss Re executives who do not receive any additional compensation for their services in these roles. When a member of the Board of Directors also serves on the board of a subsidiary, the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval also includes such subsidiary board fees.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n34.0\n\n29.9\n\n34.0\n\n## Board of Directors 34,0 29.9\n\nTerm of office: AGM 2022-AGM 2023 29,9\n\nCHF millions\n\nMaximum aggregate amount approved 9.6\n\nAmount paid/granted\n\n9.9\n\n9.9\n\n9.6\n\n34,0\n\n29,9\n\n## Say on pay\n\nAt the AGM 2022, shareholders approved a maximum aggregate amount of compensation of CHF 9.9 million for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2022 to the AGM 2023. The compensation paid to the 12 members of the Board of Directors for their term of office from the AGM 2022 to the AGM 2023 was CHF 9.6 million and therefore within the approved amount.\n\nFurther details on the compensation for members of the Board of Directors are provided in the tables on the following page. Currency conversions are calculated using December 2022 year-to-date FX rates for 2022 and 2023 figures, and December 2021 year-to-date FX rates for 2021 figures, where relevant.",

The stock ownership guidelines define the following target ownership levels by role:\n\n- \u00b7 Group CEO: five times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other Group EC members: two times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other key senior executives: one time annual base salary.\n\nThe target has to be achieved within five years. All vested shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the relevant individual and related parties as well as share units not subject to performance conditions owned directly by the relevant individual count towards the requirements under the stock ownership guidelines. Compliance is reviewed on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Compensation Committee, which decides on appropriate actions as needed. During the 2022 assessment, all Group EC members fulfilled the applicable stock ownership guidelines.\n\nAs Swiss Re believes that a meaningful stock ownership position is essential for alignment with the interests of shareholders, restrictions on cash payouts may apply in case of non-compliance.",

This peer group is regularly reviewed by the Compensation Committee to ensure its relevance. The 2022 peer group consists of the following globally active primary insurance and reinsurance firms: Allianz SE, American International Group Inc, Aviva PLC, AXA SA, Chubb Limited, Everest Re Group, Hannover Rueck SE, MetLife Inc, Muenchener Rueckversicherungs-Gesellschaft AG, Reinsurance Group of America Inc, Renaissance Re Holding Ltd, SCOR SE and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd.\n\n## Employment conditions and clauses on changes of control\n\nThe Group EC members, including the Group CEO, have open-ended employment agreements with notice periods of 12 months for termination by either the company or the individual. Their employment agreements comply with the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies limited by Shares (Ordinance). They do not contain severance clauses, any special provisions on the cancellation of contractual arrangements, agreements concerning special notice periods, waivers of lock-up periods for options, shorter vesting periods, additional contributions to pension funds or any other provisions protecting against changes of control ('golden parachutes').\n\nGroup EC members are covered by the Group's standard defined contribution pension plans. Information on the mandates and employment contracts of the members of the Board of Directors and further executive management is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 111.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the rights of members of the Group EC are identical to those of all other employees as governed by VAI, DSP, LPP and LSP plan rules. Specifically, the Board of Directors may decide at its discretion on the continuation, acceleration, amendment, or removal of any vesting, blocking or exercise conditions for the payment or grant of deferred compensation. It may also decide to replace any DSP, LPP/LSP award with shares of the entity assuming control. In addition, it may apply any other measure which it considers equitable and reasonable, provided this does not constitute impermissible compensation pursuant to the Ordinance. Should the Board of Directors decide to accelerate vesting, performance factors will generally be based on the latest performance estimates available. Information on the quantitative impact of vested shares is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 87.\n\n## Compensation for the highest-paid member of the Group EC\n\nThe table below shows the compensation paid to Christian Mumenthaler, Group CEO.

In addition, he advanced Swiss Re's digital transformation by enhancing the Reinsurance Analytics Data Model, which supports sound underwriting, and he continued to reinforce the standardised business efforts. For iptiQ, while good progress was made in terms of growth, its financial results are still below expectations. This and the delivery of other strategic programmes will need increased attention in 2023. First steps in the project to simplify the Group's organisation and management structure were initiated. The Group CEO's unabated client centricity was reflected in the very strong scores received in independent client surveys: Reinsurance secured the top position in target markets across P&C and L&H in the NMG survey, and Corporate Solutions had a Net Promoter Score of 46, which is significantly above prior-year levels.\n\nThe Group CEO showed very strong personal engagement in ESG topics and enhanced Swiss Re's profile as a prominent participant in public discussions, particularly in key focus areas such as decarbonisation. The Group delivered against the KPIs as defined in the Group Sustainability Report and continues to be recognised externally as an ESG leader, as reflected in its inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) and the AAA rating from MSCI. This recognition also reflects the Group's focus on achieving net-zero emissions on the asset and liability side by 2050 and meeting governance expectations, for which important progress was made in 2022. In Underwriting, the policies for new oil & gas projects were further strengthened and client engagements on sustainability have expanded. Strong progress was made in developing the Target-Setting Protocol of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) co-founded by Swiss Re. On the Asset Management side, the Group exceeded their carbon reduction targets for corporate bonds, listed equity and listed assets. The Group also exceeded the reduction target for absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from business air travel compared with the 2018 base year.\n\nThe Group CEO ensured adherence to the gender promotion targets for senior management, including Directors and Managing Directors across the company. In line with the Group's purpose to 'make the world more resilient', he supported Swiss Re Foundation's efforts to support emergency aid work in Ukraine as well as countries affected by the war-induced food crisis.\n\n## 110%\n\n(minimum 0%, maximum 200%)\n\n| Individual   scorecard factor     | 0.57          | Based on 70% weighting for financial performance  achievements and 30% weighting for qualitative performance  achievements.             |\n|-----------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Resulting API   for the Group CEO | CHF 1 425 000 | Calculated by multiplying the Target API of CHF 2 500 000  with the individual scorecard factor, rounded up to the next  five thousand. |",

        "page_content": "## Group EC performance\n\n## assessment and compensation\n\nPerformance of each Group EC member is assessed by means of an individual scorecard with a set of quantitative and qualitative objectives. This approach aligns the performance assessment of the Group EC to the practice used for the Group CEO. The objectives are agreed at the beginning of the performance year and are derived from the Group's strategy and the Group CEO's objectives.\n\n## Target API\n\n## Individual Scorecard Factor\n\n## API amount\n\nThe Target API amount is set separately for each Group EC member, considering the scope of the role being performed and market benchmarks.\n\nIndividual Scorecard Factor (ISF) considers performance against financial targets and individual goals. It consists of:\n\n- \u00b7  Weighted Business Performance Factor (Weighted BPF) is set for each Group EC member individually based on the role and responsibilities. It is the result of the financial performance evaluation against Group financial targets (weighted 20% to 50%) and Business Unit/Group Function targets in the Group EC member's responsibility (weighted 50% to 80%). Group financial KPIs and targets are derived from those included in the Group CEO scorecard.\n- \u00b7  Individual Payout Factor (IPF) is the result of the assessment process with 40% being attributed to the leadership behaviours objectives embedded in Swiss Re's performance culture and 60% attributed to individual goals. The Group CEO retains discretion to adjust the IPF.\n\nISF is calculated as Weighted BPF \u00d7 IPF.\n\n## Group EC performance outcomes\n\nThe Group EC focused on steering the Group and its employees through a time of escalating political tensions and war as well as the economic reverberations thereof, while continuing to advance key business and strategic ambitions. For example, a central focus was to ensure sound underwriting decisions amid an inflationary environment, rising interest rates and the impact of climate change. Another priority was to set strong foundations for Swiss Re to adopt IFRS as its reporting framework as of 1 January 2024. The Group EC also kept a strong focus on client centricity, ensuring continued support through trying times. Independent client surveys confirmed that Swiss Re enjoys a leading position in most markets globally. In terms of financial performance, 2022 was a challenging year, marked by the war in Ukraine, surging economic inflation, the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic and elevated natural catastrophe losses. As such, the Group did not meet the Group financial targets (ROE and ENW per share growth).\n\n## 2022 aggregate amount of Group EC variable short-term compensation\n\nFor 2022, the Group EC target API pool (pro-rata amount in relation to the active period on the Group EC, including the Group CEO) amounted to CHF 15.2 million compared with CHF 17.1 million in 2021. The decrease is primarily due to one Group EC member leaving who forfeited the API in line with the applicable termination and clawback provisions. For the Group CEO, the Target API was CHF 2.5 million (no change compared with 2021).\n\nThe proposed total API (including DSP) amount for 2022 for the Group EC (including the Group CEO) is CHF 9.2 million and includes pro-rata payments in relation to the active period on the Group EC for individuals who joined or left the Group EC in 2022. The Group EC was held accountable for the Group's lower financial results; the total API (including DSP) amount was reduced by CHF 6.8 million compared with the approved total 2021 API (including VAI)\n\namount of CHF 16.0 million. This represents an overall decrease of 42.5% compared with 2021. Overall, Group EC members will receive 39.5% less than their Target API for the active Group EC time (subject to shareholder approval at the 2023 AGM). For comparison, the Group API pool decreased by 28.1% against prior year.\n\nAfter carefully considering the performance of the Group EC in 2022, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that the proposed amount is proportionate given the overall achievements of the Swiss Re Group and the business environment as well as in alignment with shareholder interests.\n\nThe resulting API amount is calculated as Target API \u00d7 ISF. The API amount is capped at two times Target API with an additional cap of three times base salary for Group EC members.\n\n\u00d7\n\n=\n\nThe members of the Group EC are assessed by the Group CEO based on i) their individual performance; ii) the performance of the Business Unit/Group Function in their responsibility; and iii) Swiss Re's performance. These three assessment elements directly impact the Group EC members' compensation.\n\nSubsequently, the Compensation Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group's performance management process and challenges compensation proposals for the Group EC members.\n\nThe assessment with the proposed API amount for each Group EC member is approved by the Board of Directors.",

Combined with the base salary, it provides competitive total cash compensation for achievements against both business and individual performance targets and for the demonstration of desired behaviours.\n\nAs of performance year 2022, Swiss Re's API pool funding process places a stronger focus on financial performance outcomes, which strengthens the link between pay and performance. The financial performance assessment considers five financial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) with ENW growth and Capitalisation level as Group targets complemented by three segment\n\ntargets. The KPIs are reviewed on an annual basis. The resulting Group Business Performance Factor (BPF) is calculated through a financial model with the achievement being capped to avoid a disproportionate pool.\n\nThe Compensation Committee can apply discretion (eg to protect the franchise or ensure affordability) to make an upward or downward adjustment to the Group API pool recommended for approval to the Board of Directors. If discretion is applied, this is disclosed.\n\nBased on the respective financial and qualitative performance, the Group CEO then splits the Group API pool into pools for each Business Unit/Group Function, an aggregate pool for the Group EC and one for other key executives. Such assessment considers dimensions aligned with Swiss Re's priorities, including unit-specific financial metrics, risk and control behaviours and sustainability/ESG targets.\n\n## Business Units/Group Functions allocation\n\n## Financial dimensions\n\nPre-set metrics and targets may comprise unit-specific targets, such as combined ratio.\n\n## Qualitative dimensions\n\nDefined KPIs and measurable targets, across dimensions such as: Strategic initiatives; Sustainability; People metrics; Operational excellence and franchise value (including risk and control behaviours).\n\nUpon approval by the Board of Directors, the Group API pool is allocated to the Business Units/Group Functions.\n\n## Individual allocation\n\n## Individual performance\n\nIndividual performance is assessed against objectives achieved and demonstration of desired behaviours that are aligned to Swiss Re's purpose and business strategy.\n\nThe actual API payout is linked both to Swiss Re's business results and to individual performance.\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "The API for each employee is determined based on their Target API, individual performance and performance of the Business Unit/Group Function the employee belongs to. Individual performance is assessed against individual goals and Swiss Re's behaviour expectations and corporate values, all aligned to Swiss Re's business strategy. Swiss Re's 'leadership from every seat' philosophy, as part of which desired behaviours are clearly articulated, is embedded in the continuous performance management and feedback discussions. This allows for forward-looking conversations that foster real-time improvement and adaptation to business needs. In doing so, Swiss Re ensures robust performance differentiation and transparent pay for performance. When the total API level for an employee equals or exceeds a pre-defined amount, a portion is deferred into the Deferred Share Plan (DSP). The non-deferred portion is settled in immediate cash (cash API).\n\n## Limitations to avoid excessive payouts\n\nAPI awards to individuals are capped at two times Target API. For Group EC members an additional cap of three times annual base salary is applied. Both the Group API pool as well as an individual API can be reduced to zero. Forfeiture of unsettled awards and clawback provisions for settled awards apply in a range of events, enabling Swiss Re to seek repayment where appropriate. Examples of such events are acts which can be considered as malfeasance, fraud or misconduct.\n\n## 2022 API outcomes\n\n2022 was a challenging year, marked by the war in Ukraine, surging economic inflation, the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic and elevated natural catastrophe losses. The main performance outcomes include:\n\n- \u00b7 ENW per share growth was at -5.9%, significantly below the target of 10%, reflecting natural catastrophe and large man-made losses for non-life business, adverse assumption changes in L&H Reinsurance as well as the impact of economic inflation and pandemic risk\n- model update. In addition, investment activities resulted in a loss due to credit spread widening and equity mark-to-market losses, partially offset by outperformance from alternative investments.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re's capital position remained very strong, with the Group Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio of 294% above the 200-250% target range performance, reflecting increased interest rates and the de-risking of the asset portfolio.\n- \u00b7 L&H Reinsurance reported a net income of USD 416 million for 2022, above the target net income of approximately USD 300 million. L&H Reinsurance returned to profitability despite COVID-19related claims of USD 588 million.\n- \u00b7 P&C Reinsurance's normalised combined ratio of 96.9% did not deliver against its target of less than 94%, mainly due to the impacts of higher-than-expected economic inflation, which drove an increase in the average claims size.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Solutions' combined ratio was 93.1%, outperforming the external target of less than 95%, reflecting the solid underlying business performance as a result of strong portfolio quality and new business growth in selected focus portfolios.\n\nNext to financial achievements driving the funding, the proposed Group BPF was also evaluated in the broader context, including affordability, proportionality of value sharing, risk and control behaviours, sustainability/ESG and other qualitative dimensions, as relevant. The Board of Directors applied no upward or downward discretion and approved the Group BPF of 0.68.\n\n## Deferred compensation: DSP Purpose\n\nThe Deferred Share Plan (DSP) replaced the Value Alignment Incentive (VAI) as of performance year 2022. The DSP is a mandatory three-year deferral of a portion of the API when the total API amount for an employee equals or exceeds the threshold. The higher the API granted, the greater the amount of compensation that remains at risk through deferral into the DSP as shown in the table below.\n\nThe DSP supports Swiss Re's performance culture as the ultimate value of the deferred variable compensation depends on Swiss Re's future performance and value creation reflected in Swiss Re's share price.\n\n## Changes implemented as of performance year 2022\n\nThe following changes were implemented as of performance year 2022 (ie for deferred awards as of 2023) to better align employee and shareholder interests and to conform to market practice:\n\n- \u00b7 Deferral is in the form of share units settled in shares (where legally permissible) after a three-year vesting period.\n- \u00b7 Threshold was increased to USD 150 000 for individuals with an API equal to or exceeding this amount. The deferral percentages for the Group CEO, other Group EC members and key executives remained unchanged.\n\nRunning VAI awards (ie awarded in 2022 and before) are not impacted by these changes.\n\n## Portion of API that is deferred into the DSP\n\n| Group CEO              | 50% of API                                                                                                                                        |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other Group EC members | 45% of API                                                                                                                                        |\n| Other key executives   | 40% of API                                                                                                                                        |\n| All other employees    | 50% of the API amount exceeding USD 150 000   with a minimum deferral amount of USD 5 000 at  USD 150 000 and up to a maximum of 40% of total API |",

The previous years' business losses were predominantly driven by losses and reserve increases. These included COVID-19-related losses in the years 2020 and 2021. In addition, natural catastrophe and man-made losses impacted the results\n\nas well as reserve increases relating to economic inflation for P&C Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions. The previous years' business performance in 2022 further deteriorated due to updates to the internal pandemic risk model and inflation scenarios in Reinsurance. The underlying performance was reflected in differentiated factors, eg 84.5% for iptiQ and 98.5% for Corporate Solutions.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Illustrative example of realised performance for the VAI 2019 (awarded 2020)\n\nGranted and realised VAI are shown on the right for a grant of CHF 100 000 on the VAI 2019 (awarded 2020).

The LSP is a discretionary, forward-looking instrument awarded to incentivise decisionmaking that is also in the shareholders' interest. The design of the LSP aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Direct participants' energies on earnings, capital efficiency and Swiss Re's position against peers, all of which are critical to sustain shareholder value creation.\n- \u00b7 Focus participants on long-term forwardlooking business growth.\n- \u00b7 Attract and retain individuals with exceptional skills.\n- \u00b7 Provide competitive compensation that rewards long-term performance.\n\n## Changes implemented for grant year 2022\n\nAs of 2022 grants, the LSP is aligning and re-balancing shareholders' and employees' interests even more closely, and better supporting the business strategy through a combination of the following changes:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual targets for the ROE performance condition are aligned with externally communicated targets.\n- \u00b7 The relative TSR vesting curve pays out for a wider range of performance, with payout starting at the 35th percentile (previously 50th percentile); the maximum payout is realised only at the 90th percentile (previously 75th percentile). This aligns with prevalent Swiss market practice, ensuring that Swiss Re maintains its competitiveness to retain talent even though achieving maximum payout becomes more challenging.\n- \u00b7 In addition, the peer group has been reduced to 13 companies to place greater focus on global reinsurance companies.\n\n## Design\n\nGrant levels are determined based on performed and market benchmarks.\n\nThe size of the LSP pool is reviewed each performance, affordability and market Group's total variable compensation pool.\n\nmultiple factors including the role being year in the context of sustainable business competitiveness, and funded as part of the\n\nFor Group EC members and other key executives, the award value is split equally into three underlying Performance Share Units (PSUs) at the grant date. For other eligible employees, the award value is either\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nsplit into 50% PSUs and 50% Share Units (SUs), or granted in 100% SUs. A valuation by a third party is used to determine the number of PSUs to be granted. The number of SUs is determined using the average of the closing share prices of 30 trading days prior to the date of grant, as SUs are not subject to performance conditions.\n\nThe vesting period, during which performance is measured, is three years. For LSP awards granted to Group EC members and other key executives, the duration of the LSP is five years, comprising a three-year vesting and performance measurement period and an additional two-year holding period.\n\nAt the end of the three-year (performance) measurement period, PSUs and SUs will be settled in shares where legally permissible. Forfeiture and clawback provisions apply in a range of events as defined in the LSP plan rules. Swiss Re also allows for LSP participants to have shares sold or automatically settled on a net basis as applicable, to cover statutory tax and social security liabilities that may arise.",

Target and maximum are defined per plan year to reflect Swiss Re's incremental performance ambitions. The vesting between threshold, target and maximum is linear.\n\n## Measure: ENW\n\nThe performance condition for the second PSU component is the growth of absolute ENW (the difference between the market consistent value of assets and liabilities of the corresponding performance year within the performance period). Depending on the level of absolute ENW growth, an ENW PSU\n\ncomponent multiple between 0% and 150% will apply. Vesting is linear and begins only with an absolute ENW growth above zero.\n\n## Measure: relative TSR\n\nThe third PSU performance condition is relative TSR measured over three years relative to the TSR of the pre-defined peer group for the same period. This peer group consists of companies that are similar in scale and have a global footprint or a similar business mix to Swiss Re.

To account for the currently volatile\n\nUS GAAP Shareholders' equity as a result of interest rate movements, Shareholders' equity will be adjusted for unrealised gains and losses. The corresponding adjusted Equity calculation will be disclosed. These changes apply only to new grants. Looking ahead, in the course of 2023, the Board of Directors will decide on the changes to\n\nthe running plans which are required due to the introduction of IFRS as well as any other changes due to the new accounting standard.

During a one-year contribution period, employees can purchase shares for up to a maximum of CHF 21 000 (capped at 10% of base salary). After the three-year vesting period, Swiss Re provides a 30% match on the number of shares held by employees. During the vesting period, matching shares are subject to forfeiture provisions. The GSPP has the same core design in all locations.\n\n## 2022 DSP, LSP and GSPP termination and clawback provisions\n\n| Termination reason    | DSP

The Board of Directors is also responsible for designing the compensation system and defining individual compensation packages.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Compensation Report\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the information on compensation, loans and advances pursuant to Art. 14-16 Veg\u00fcV is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this Compensation Report.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:\n\n- \uf8e7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the Compensation Report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

The Group Sustainability Strategy 2023-2025 applies to all its business activities, with targets seeking to support the achievement of Swiss Re's ambitions for the short and medium term (the next ten years), as well as for the long term (until 2050). The first ambition of the Group Sustainability Strategy centres on climate mitigation and decarbonisation, while the second focuses on climate adaptation and disaster resilience complemented by financial inclusion and healthcare protection. Swiss Re has committed to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050.\u00b9 The company aims to contribute to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon\n\neconomy by de-risking transition projects and infrastructure, scaling up sustainable investments, decarbonising its operations and working with suppliers, clients and investees to support them in doing the same.\n\nTo advance the net-zero GHG transition in the re/insurance industry, global standards are needed for measuring and disclosing GHG emissions and for setting related targets. As a founding member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA) and the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), Swiss Re is actively engaged in these discussions. In 2022, Swiss Re chaired the development of the first version of the NZIA Target-Setting Protocol (TSP) and\n\n## Managing risks related to climate change\n\n- \u00b7 Property re/insurance for natural catastrophe risks is one of Swiss Re's core business areas and is exposed to physical risk from climate change. As policy terms and pricing are renegotiated annually, Swiss Re continuously adapts its pricing models to the most recent loss experience and scientific evidence relating to all major risk factors. This includes the impact of climate change, however, this is only one of many risk factors. The results of a scenario analysis for tropical cyclones (Swiss Re's largest weather-related exposures) suggest that in the long term (ie 2050), the projected increases in annual expected losses will not exceed the increase in insured weather-related losses over the past three decades.\n- \u00b7 Other re/insurance portfolios, such as life & health or agriculture, are also exposed to physical risk from climate change. However, only certain sub-segments of the agriculture reinsurance book are affected. These are controlled through an annual review of assumptions, pricing and policy terms.\n- \u00b7 In l i f e  & h e a l t h , more frequent and intense heatwaves, air pollution from wildfires and vector-borne diseases are likely to increase mortality, while climate change is expected to lead to fewer deaths linked to cold temperatures. Climate change is only one of many risk drivers, some of which can contribute to lower mortality and morbidity rates. The risks in life & health are mitigated through systematic review processes for mortality assumptions based on the latest available scientific evidence.\n- \u00b7 In Swiss Re's view, the transition to a low-carbon economy is not likely to present a material financial risk for its re/insurance activities . Swiss Re is continuing to reduce its exposure to carbon-intense business and expects that the associated risks can be managed effectively, primarily through the annual renewal of contracts and assumptions based on the most recent historic loss experience and scientific evidence. Furthermore, the climate-related policies of Swiss Re's ESG Risk Framework\n\nthe Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) Working Group that developed the Accounting and Reporting Standard for InsuranceAssociated Emissions. The results of these collaborations support Swiss Re's ambition to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nSwiss Re's Group CEO Christian Mumenthaler is Co-Chair of the WEF Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, which aims to accelerate climate action across value chains. The Alliance consists of over 120 CEOs from the world's largest corporations who have committed to net-zero GHG emissions in their own operations and across their value chains by 2050.\n\n- ensure that risks associated with transactions are identified, assessed and addressed.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re's approach to managing investment-related climate risk involves the systematic monitoring of the carbon intensity of its corporate bond, listed equity and government bond portfolios, and parts of the real estate portfolio. For the corporate bond and listed equity portfolios, Swiss Re also tracks temperature scores.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re continues to assess the impact of different climate change scenarios on underwriting and investment activities . The results for investments indicate that Swiss Re's portfolio runs a more limited transition risk in the short to medium term when it comes to an orderly scenario. Under a disorderly scenario, the implications, especially for climate-sensitive industries, are expected to be more severe. Analytics further suggest physical risks to be relevant in the long term but manageable for the real asset holdings.\n- 1 Net-zero GHG emissions means that for every tonne of CO2e that cannot be avoided, a tonne must be permanently removed from the atmosphere through so-called carbon-removal approaches.",

In 2022, for example, Swiss Re\n\nhelped corporate clients to quantify their physical climate risk exposure with its proprietary Climate Risk Scores.\n\n- \u00b7 The transition to a low-carbon economy offers business opportunities across a range of sectors such as power and energy, materials and processes, logistics and transport, as well as agroforestry and food. Swiss Re is well positioned to support this transition with re/insurance cover, and is particularly active in the renewable energy sector. In 2022, Swiss Re underwrote direct and\n\n## Aim to reach net-zero GHG emissions\n\nIn line with the Paris Agreement, Swiss Re aspires to reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050:\n\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re will publish absolute GHG emissions associated with selected direct and facultative re/insurance portfolios, as well as a respective target by July 2023 based on NZIA's Target-Setting Protocol and the PCAF Standard.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re prepared the implementation of the Thermal Coal Policy extension for reinsurance treaties that became effective at the beginning of 2023.\n- \u00b7 In 2022, Swiss Re further tightened its Oil and Gas Policy for direct and facultative re/insurance.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re is currently developing an approach for oil and gas in treaty reinsurance and will communicate on progress later in 2023.\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures of the Financial Stability Board (TCFD)\n\nSwiss Re has played an active role in the TCFD since its creation by the Financial Stability Board, and began to reflect the TCFD recommendations in the 2016 Financial Report. Since then, Swiss Re has continued to expand its climate-related reporting structured along the TCFD's four pillars and eleven recommended disclosures.\n\n- \u00b7 For its corporate bond and listed equity portfolio as well as parts of the real estate portfolio , Swiss Re has set intermediate carbon intensity reduction targets. Swiss Re also aims to fully exit from coal-based assets for its listed equity and corporate bond portfolios by 2030, and limit maturities for fossil fuel-related investments for its infrastructure debt and corporate private placement portfolios.\n- \u00b7 In 2019, Swiss Re committed to net-zero GHG emissions in its operations by 2030 . To achieve this target, the company follows the motto 'Do our best, remove the rest'. The internal Carbon Steering Levy incentivises greenhouse gas emission reduction. In 2022, this levy was USD 112 per tonne of CO2e. It is set to increase to USD 200 by 2030 and provides the funds to fully compensate residual emissions through carbon removal solutions by 2030 .\n\n| Governance           | Strategy                                                    | Risk management                                                     | Metrics and targets                                            |\n|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A) Board oversight   | A) Description of  climate-related risks  and opportunities | A) Processes for  identifying and  assessing climate- related risks | A) Metrics to assess  climate-related risks  and opportunities |\n| B) Management's role | B) Impact of  climate-related risks  and opportunities      | B) Process for  managing climate- related risks                     | B) Scope 1, 2 and 3  greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions           |\n| Source: TCFD         | C) Resilience of  strategy in climate- related scenarios    | C) Integration into  overall risk  management                       | C) Targets to manage  climate-related risks  and opportunities |\n\n- facultative re/insurance for more than 12 000 renewable energy generation facilities, which have the potential to avoid around 41 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\n- \u00b7 Green, social and sustainability bonds contribute to financing the transition to a low-carbon economy .

Swiss Re has therefore committed to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nClimate risk mitigation and the energy transition have been core pillars of Swiss Re's sustainability strategy since 2019. Advancing the net-zero transition and building societal resilience are the two ambitions in the Group Sustainability Strategy 2023-2025.\u00b9 The first ambition centres on climate mitigation and decarbonisation, while the second focuses on climate adaptation and disaster resilience complemented by financial inclusion and healthcare protection. The company aims to contribute to accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy by de-risking transition projects and infrastructure, scaling up sustainable investments, decarbonising its operations and working with suppliers, clients and investees to support them in doing the same.\n\nThe ambition to 'advance the net-zero transition' is implemented with a focus on the following activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Committing to a decarbonisation pathway and setting emission reduction targets for assets, liabilities and operations.\n- \u00b7 Providing risk transfer solutions and investments to advance the net-zero transition across different sectors.\n- \u00b7 Engaging with clients and stakeholders, building on Swiss Re's risk knowledge.\n\nThis chapter describes risks and opportunities Swiss Re has identified in the short term (over the next five years), in the medium term (up to ten years) as well as in the long term (2050).\n\nRe/insurance activities and own operations are covered in the first sub-section, while information about investments is in another section (see page 163).\n\n## Swiss Re's net-zero transition\n\nFor details on Swiss Re's climate targets and activities, see page 173 for underwriting, page 163 for investments and pages 180-181 for Swiss Re's own operations.",

        "page_content": "## Re/insurance activities and Swiss Re's own operations\n\n## Physical risks\n\nSwiss Re deems the impact of climate-change on its underwriting portfolios to be limited, manageable and therefore not material. Portfolios where climate change could have a limited impact are weather-related re/insurance covers, life & health and selected segments of casualty re/insurance.\n\nSwiss Re's re/insurance businesses are potentially exposed to physical and transition risks related to climate change. Such risks could impact demand for re/insurance products as well as the profitability in the short, medium and long term (ie the next five years, the next decade and in 2050, respectively). In this report, these risks are disclosed for portfolios where the impact could be financially material for the Swiss Re Group.\n\nThe financial materiality of climate-related risks is determined based on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative threshold for the identification of potentially relevant portfolios is 5% of total premium, reserves or expected profits. Annual expected losses are used additionally for natural catastrophe-related business. In a second step, the projected trends for climate-related risks relevant for the respective portfolios are evaluated on a qualitative basis and - if possible on a quantitative basis. In addition, climate-related risks are disclosed for portfolios where weather-related perils are the dominant loss driver. This covers the following insurance portfolios 1 :\n\n- \u00b7 Property (weather-related, including agriculture business)\n- \u00b7 Liability\n- \u00b7 Life & health: mortality and critical illness\n\nThe financial materiality of climate risks for Swiss Re's own operations is assessed for its main office locations.\n\nAlthough the physical risks arising from climate change can have significant economic consequences over time, especially from a wider societal perspective, they represent a limited, manageable and therefore not material risk for Swiss Re's underwriting portfolios.\n\nPhysical risks posed by climate change could potentially affect the following areas of Swiss Re's re/insurance activities and own operations. They can:\n\n- \u00b7 Impact loss experience and thus influence modelling and costing of weather-related natural perils in property insurance and other lines of business.\n- \u00b7 Impact the insurability of property risks exposed to extreme weather events.\n- \u00b7 Reduce/disrupt operations.\n\nPhysical risks related to climate change could also impact other business areas but overall, the impact of physical risks is not deemed to be financially material for Swiss Re at this stage, based on the models and scenarios used.\u00b9\n\n## Costing of weather-related perils in property re/insurance\n\nClimate change is impacting the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes such as tropical cyclones, convective storms, floods or windstorms. Swiss Re therefore adjusts the costing of such risks on a regular basis using its proprietary loss-modelling framework.\n\nThis framework allows Swiss Re to calculate the annual expected losses (AEL) and loss-frequency distributions for its natural catastrophe businesses. With the AEL, Swiss Re identifies the financially most material weather-related portfolios that may be impacted by climate change. In 2022, the AEL for tropical cyclone North Atlantic, US convective storm, European windstorm, Japanese tropical cyclone and European flood remained the five largest weatherrelated perils and above the 5% threshold\n\nof total weather-related AEL. The table on page 172 contains the respective data, including a regional breakdown by peril.\n\nSwiss Re's models show that the effects of natural climate variability dominate over climate change impacts for Swiss Re's weather-related risk exposure, affecting both the frequency and severity of extreme events in all regions. This is expected to remain the case both in the short and medium term, in line with the most recent scientific findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u00b2\n\nSince most property re/insurance contracts have a duration of one year, updated risk views are quickly reflected in the costing of natural catastrophe risks. Overall, Swiss Re considers the natural catastrophe re/insurance market a healthy risk pool, and a growth opportunity subject to risk-commensurate pricing (see Opportunities, page 159).\n\nSwiss Re closely monitors climatic trends and other macro risk factors that are potentially material for its business over various time horizons. Physical climate change risks that affect the assessment and management of weather-related risks are:\n\n- \u00b7 Confidence about observed and future climate trends is highest for risks related to the increase in global mean surface temperatures . For example, melting glaciers and ice caps as well as the thermal expansion of water in warmer temperatures are leading to rising sea levels . In turn, this can directly increase the magnitude of storm surges , a long-term risk for coastal regions. To date, the rise in sea levels has been relatively slow and will likely remain so in the short and medium term, allowing time for measures to mitigate the risk of coastal flooding.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re mitigates this risk by managing its exposure to sea level rise with up-to-date risk models and by limiting its risk accumulation in the most exposed areas to ensure a well-diversified underwriting portfolio on an annual basis\n- 1 In addition to property, liability, and life & health, motor also accounts for more than 5% of Swiss Re's total re/insurance portfolios. Increased precipitation could lead to more accidents in motor, but this is unlikely to have a substantial impact. While hail risk is an important risk factor in motor insurance, no clear trends due to climate change are projected for this hazard in the short, medium or long term.",

        "page_content": "(see also 'Swiss Re's strategy to ensure the resilience of its property business in a changing climate', page 162).\n\n- \u00b7 Another outcome of climate change for which there is high confidence is increased temperature extremes , which will continue to bring longer and more frequent heatwaves, droughts and periods of water scarcity. Heatwaves affect agriculture, workforce productivity, infrastructure, water resources, health and mortality. In addition, hot and dry conditions exacerbate drought and wildfire risk , as seen in different regions in recent years, including California, Southern Europe and Australia. Convective storms and other frequency perils mostly affect direct insurers, as losses from such events often remain below the retention levels of property reinsurance programmes. Reinsurers are exposed to frequency perils mainly through aggregate excess of loss structures, event excess of loss structures that have a low attachment point and proportional treaties. Swiss Re further reduced exposure to such structures by increasing retentions by clients and underwriting fewer annual aggregate covers in the 1 January 2023 renewals.\n- \u00b7 Rising temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture, thus increasing the severity and frequency of rainfall events, which in turn is expected to amplify flood risk. However, the rainfall-flood link is complex . Furthermore, flood risk is also impacted by other factors such as soil sealing, urban flood protection, land-use changes and seasonal dependencies such as snow melt and soil moisture. Regional trends are already observable, but the property insurance impact for flood-related losses is limited due to the large protection gap for this peril.\n- \u00b7 There is lower confidence in the understanding of trends in modes of climate variability , which encompasses atmospheric and oceanographic circulation changes. Given their material impact on extreme weather events, Swiss Re performs internal research and collaborates with leading scientists to integrate the impact of observed climate change in its in-house loss models, with an additional forward-looking component to capture anticipated climate change impacts for the upcoming underwriting\n\nseasons (see Resilience under different climate scenarios, page 161, and Climate risk management, page 167).\n\n## Impact on the insurability of property risks exposed to extreme weather events\n\nClimate change could affect the insurability of risks exposed to extreme weather events through three main factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Assessability\n- \u00b7 Economic viability\u00b9\n- \u00b7 Randomness of risk\n\n## Assessability\n\nIn order to offer insurance protection, re/insurers need to be able to assess the frequency and severity of possible losses from extreme whether events. As climate change affects the risk landscape, Swiss Re regularly updates its loss models to such factors and expects extreme weather risks to remain assessable by scientific methods in the short, medium and long term. Swiss Re's in-house development of risk models for weather-related perils ensures full modelling transparency and the ability to efficiently assess and update models if new scientific evidence becomes available.\n\n## Economic viability\n\nAn increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events requires a rise in premium. If large increases are required, insurance may no longer be economically viable for the owners of certain objects.\n\nCoastal areas affected by tropical cyclones are particularly at risk. While there is substantial uncertainty in the projection of frequency and severity of tropical cyclones in the short and medium term, rising sea levels are expected to lead to non-linear increases in storm surge risk for coastal areas in the long term. Additionally, warmer temperatures will increase the severity of rainfall induced by tropical cyclones. In combination, these developments might push re/insurance prices in coastal areas affected by tropical cyclones beyond affordable limits, especially if counteracting climate adaptation measures were to remain insufficient.\n\nIf re/insurance became unaffordable for certain areas/risks, demand for re/insurance would decrease. However, this would likely be at least partly offset\n\nby increasing demand in less exposed areas, as people relocate, risk awareness increases and premium rates rise.\n\n## Randomness\n\nFinally, insurability depends on the random nature of a risk. If risks increase to a level at which losses are certain and predictable, then insurance is no longer the right instrument. For example, if there is permanent flooding due to rising sea levels, insurance is not the appropriate financing mechanism to protect assets.\n\n## Impact of weather-related perils on agriculture reinsurance\n\nAgriculture re/insurance is a short-term cover against perils like hail, drought, excess rain and frost, however, the extent of covers provided diverges across markets. Climate change is impacting agriculture re/insurance, but this is limited to the sub-portfolios of crop and forestry, which are mostly exposed to hail and drought. Global climate models predict increasing trends for drought and frost in the short, medium and long term, but not in all regions. While hail is an important peril for Swiss Re's agriculture reinsurance book, constituting roughly 40% of respective premiums, there is low confidence, ie high uncertainty about future changes in hail activity driven by climate change in most regions. The same is the case for excess rain activity. As a result, less than half of Swiss Re's total agriculture book is considered susceptible to climate change.\n\nThe impact of climate change on Swiss Re's agriculture book is mitigated by several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Agriculture insurance is a short-tail business, which means that terms and conditions, as well as the portfolio composition are reviewed and adjusted annually.\n- \u00b7 Climate change that has manifested to date is reflected in historical losses, which are the main basis for risk modelling, and Swiss Re is observing increasing prices in agriculture re/insurance markets.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re continuously enhances forward-looking modelling.\n- \u00b7 Climate adaptation measures taken through agro-management practices such as new seeds, fertilizers, etc.",

        "page_content": "## Climate change's impact on life & health re/insurance\n\nSwiss Re does not consider climate change to have a financially material negative effect on its life & health portfolios in the short, medium or long term.\n\nClimate change can affect human health, and can therefore impact Swiss Re's life & health portfolios through several channels. The most pronounced risks are expected to be extreme heat, air pollution and increased exposure to infectious diseases spread by non-human vectors. Consequently, non-communicable diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases, respiratory illnesses, lung and skin cancers, among others, and increased spread and emergence of tropical infectious diseases could become more frequent for the more severe climate change scenarios.\n\nMore severe and frequent heatwaves have the potential to increase the incidence of heart attacks and strokes, thus affecting both mortality and critical illness portfolios. Heatwaves will extend to regions previously not affected, thereby increasing the share of the world's population impacted by such conditions. However, the extent of an individual's direct exposure to risk factors and access to mitigation tools will be the determinants of their overall risk.\n\nA general rise in temperature and increased humidity enables vector-borne diseases to enter new areas. Climate change will extend the transmission season and geographical range for many infectious diseases, allowing them to spread into previously uninhabitable regions. Lyme disease, avian influenza, meningitis, dengue fever and other tropical bacterial and viral infections are therefore projected to rise.\n\nSevere drought conditions can lead to more wildfires, which cause air pollution. Such air pollution can extend to regions far from the fire itself and last for weeks after the event, leading to deteriorating health conditions and increasing mortality experience.\n\nThe above risks will mostly impact clinically vulnerable individuals with pre-existing comorbidities, or groups such as the elderly and the disabled. Increasingly frail, ageing populations could push up annual deaths. Without mitigation action, mortality rates and healthcare costs could rise, leading to higher claims costs than anticipated by re/insurers.\n\nScientific evidence quantifying the impact of climate-related heatwaves, air pollution and vector-borne diseases on health and mortality outcomes is still limited. There is additional uncertainty around how climate change will play out in conjunction with other key adverse trends such as increases in unhealthy behaviours or obesity. Swiss Re follows the scientific discussion and incorporates new evidence into its mortality assumptions on a regular basis (see Climate risk management, page 167).\n\nCurrent research suggests that in Swiss Re's main life & health markets, ie North America and Northern Europe, extreme cold is currently a more substantial driver of mortality than extreme heat.\u00b9 Consequently, Swiss Re does not expect a financially material net adverse impact from climate change on mortality for these portfolios in the long-term. Reductions in deaths related to cold temperatures will outweigh the rise in deaths linked to heat. A modest impact at most would only arise in the more distant future, ie after 2050, and in severe scenarios (see Life & health re/insurance section in Resilience under different climate scenarios, page 162).\n\nSouthern Asia and Africa are estimated to see large upticks in heat-driven mortality by 2050, whether climate change is moderate or unmitigated. There may be a potential rise in critical illness claims in countries where extreme heat is most prevalent.\n\nSeveral factors are expected to reduce the impact of climate-related risks on Swiss Re's Life & Health business:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy holders can reduce severity and duration of exposure to the elements.\n- \u00b7 Affordable mitigation measures such as air purifiers, air cooling or increased hydration will further limit the impact on insured lives.\n- \u00b7 In some climate scenarios, anthropogenic air pollution, a driver of claims today, is expected to improve, as countries push for more stringent emissions limits.\n\n## Swiss Re's own operations\n\nAccording to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe loss models, severe weather risks are potentially of importance for some operations, mainly in Florida and on the north-eastern coast of the US. However, even assuming an extreme climate change scenario, Swiss Re does not expect any of its office locations to be exposed to risk levels that would undermine their economic viability. Additionally, robust and regularly tested business continuity plans covering all locations are in place to mitigate the risk of climate-related disruptions (see Climate risk management, page 167).",

        "page_content": "## Transition risks\n\nSwiss Re does not consider the transition to a low-carbon economy a material financial risk for its re/insurance business in the short, medium and long term. It expects to be able to manage the associated risks effectively thanks to the established processes for reviewing underwriting assumptions based on the most recent historic loss experiences and scientific findings, as well as the annual renewal of contracts.\n\nSwiss Re has assessed the impact of the following transition risks on its property and casualty re/insurance business:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy and legal risks\n- \u00b7 Technology risks\n- \u00b7 Market and reputational risks\n\n## Policy and legal risks\n\nAs the transition to achieving a net-zero emissions economy by mid-century or earlier gains momentum, material policytriggered changes are expected for the real economy in areas such as power and energy, materials and processes, logistics and transportation, and agroforestry and land-use practices. Such policy changes may include regulations to increase energy and material efficiency, mandates to rapidly scale up renewable energy and clean mobility, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, the introduction of carbon pricing, policies addressing land-use change and agricultural practices, as well as the scaling up of carbon removal technologies.\n\nThis requires a solid understanding of the associated policy and legal risks. Certain policy risks might also influence the risk quality of some insured assets in the medium to long term due to factors such as increased cost pressure and reduced asset maintenance. Swiss Re believes it can manage these risks effectively by frequently reviewing the underwriting assumptions using its formalised process.\n\n## Risks related to climate change litigation (CCL)\n\nSwiss Re identified CCL as a potential risk over a decade ago. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the number of CCL court cases has more than doubled to a total of more than 2000 cases worldwide in\n\n2022. These activities are currently focused on the US, Europe and Australia, but they are spreading to other jurisdictions as well. Most of the cases are directed against governments and public entities, but private companies are also increasingly being targeted. For now, most of the cases brought up aim to change behaviour rather than asking for monetary compensation. The potentially insurance relevant cases fall mostly within one of the following four categories: contribution to climate change, improper disclosure, misleading product disclosures and mismanagement of climate-related risks.\n\nTo date, many of the CCL decisions in the cases that are potentially relevant for insurers were made in favour of defendants. They have therefore not led to significant claims for the re/insurance industry. However, CCL has the potential to cause moderate losses in certain segments of casualty insurance in the short to medium term.\n\nWhile Swiss Re has not faced any significant CCL claims to date, it actively monitors and assesses CCL risks in its underwriting and research units. In particular, Swiss Re tracks advances in climate attribution science, CCL cases, regulatory changes and developments in legal concepts for different geographies, industries and lines of business in order to assess potential exposures under different scenarios. Swiss Re is currently also developing a methodology to monitor potential exposures from CCL. Potential CCL exposures are mitigated by a CCL-specific underwriting strategy (eg limited risk appetite for certain industries) in addition to the reduction of carbon exposures as early as 2018 (see General sustainability risks in Swiss Re's re/insurance business, page 168). However, cases might still arise from runoff for a number of years.\n\n## Technology risks\n\nSwiss Re is likely to be impacted by the technological transition in two ways:\n\n- \u00b7 New or rapidly developing technologies by definition do not have loss histories and thus may be challenging to price accurately. Possible loss scenarios and the related expenses need to be developed. Once these are ready and tested, new technologies are likely to present a sector with an opportunity\n\nfor growth. Offshore wind projects, for example, have developed into one such growth opportunity (see Opportunities related to transition risk, page 160). The shift of global motor vehicle fleets away from internal combustion engines and towards electric motors is another example. This development entails the implementation of a variety of new technologies, from new lightweight materials to advanced battery systems, which will also impact loss patterns.\n\n- \u00b7 New low-carbon technologies are likely to gradually displace traditional, fossil fuel-based ones. For example, power generation will shift to wind and solar farms delivering intermittent power. This could affect other elements of power systems that had originally been designed for stable base load electricity delivered by fossil fuel power plants.\n\nWhile the pace of technological development in the underlying industries is high, the impact on re/insurance portfolios is expected to be incremental. It takes time for new technologies to fully replace old ones across entire portfolios. Dealing with such technology changes is business as usual for Swiss Re. As most re/insurance contracts are renewed annually, Swiss Re can develop the appropriate underwriting experience, loss adjustment and claims handling.\n\n## Market and reputational risks\n\nWith policy, legal and technological changes as a backdrop, consumer and investment preferences are expected to further shift toward less carbon-intensive products and services over time. Swiss Re continues to adapt to the related changes in re/insurance markets.\n\nIn addition, to support their decision-making, investors, regulators and other stakeholders have started to ask for greater transparency and more information regarding re/insurers' exposure to emission-intensive sectors as well as their contribution to low emissionsrelated risk transfer solutions.\n\nCompanies whose disclosures are misleading or overstate their climate efforts, which is referred to as greenwashing, can sustain reputational and legal damage.",

Developing corresponding risk transfer products and related services is a core part of Swiss Re's Group Sustainability Strategy 2023-2025 (see Climate strategy, page 153).\n\n## Opportunities related to physical risks\n\nSwiss Re's re/insurance products against natural catastrophes constitute one of its core businesses that help clients cope effectively with current climate risks. In 2022, premiums for natural catastrophe covers amounted to USD 4.8 billion, or 18% of corresponding Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions premiums.\u00b9\n\nThe natural catastrophe market as well as the broader property insurance market are expected to see strong growth in the long term. A recent sigma report by Swiss Re Institute projects that the global property insurance market is set to experience stronger growth than the overall economy until 2040.\u00b2 While economic growth and increasing urbanisation in emerging markets will contribute 80% of additional premiums over the next two decades, 20% of additional premiums projected until 2040 are due to increased physical risk because of climate change. At the same time, the share of uninsured losses remains high, indicating further growth potential.\u00b3 Swiss Re also helps expand re/insurance protection to non-traditional clients (in particular in the public sector), underdeveloped markets and by offering innovative risk transfer instruments.\n\n## Products and services that tackle physical climate risk\n\nExamples of recent deals that tackle physical climate risk include:\n\n## Providing natural catastrophe cover to protect public sector exposure:\n\nFollowing a successful five-year pilot in which Swiss Re was the lead reinsurer for the Uganda Agriculture Insurance Scheme (UAIS), Uganda's government decided to extend the scheme for another four years. Today, this publicprivate partnership protects more than 350 000 smallholder farmers in Uganda with a range of products including parametric crop weather index insurance, multi-peril crop insurance, livestock insurance and poultry insurance. Additionally, farmers receive training to help them adapt their techniques to climate change. Thanks to the success of the insurance scheme, the government aims to expand the programme to more farmers, while Swiss Re is exploring the possibility of supporting the replication of the scheme in neighbouring countries.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Climate Risk Scores: Helping corporate clients quantify their physical climate risk exposure: Swiss Re's proprietary\n\nClimate Risk Scores help companies assess future risks resulting from weather-related hazards exacerbated by climate change.

        "page_content": "## Opportunities related to transition risks\n\nThe transition to a net-zero emissions economy offers business opportunities for Swiss Re across a range of sectors such as power and energy, materials and processes, logistics and transport, and agroforestry and food. In a study, McKinsey estimates that in order to achieve net zero by 2050, new capital spending for low-emissions assets will amount to around 3% of global GDP, or a cumulative USD 105 trillion. This is on top of current spending of USD 170 trillion.\u00b9 For the power sector alone, the International Energy Agency estimates that achieving net-zero emissions could create a cumulative USD 27 trillion market opportunity for manufacturers of wind turbines, solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, electrolysers and fuel cells.\u00b2 Realising the potential will require a strong contribution from private capital providers.\n\nSwiss Re has developed an approach to benefit from transition opportunities in the short, medium and long term. This includes further developing existing business areas, such as renewable energy. In addition, new technological segments have been identified and assessed in terms of re/insurance market potential in the short, medium and long term. Based on this assessment, business areas have been prioritised for investments in research, and new business propositions will be developed.\n\nSwiss Re is re/insuring renewable energy projects across all lines of business. In 2022, Swiss Re underwrote direct and facultative property and engineering re/insurance (construction and operation) for more than 12 000 renewable energy generation facilities, which have the potential to avoid around 41 million tonnes of CO2 emissions annually.\u00b3\n\nSwiss Re Corporate Solutions is a recognised market leader for offshore wind risks, but Reinsurance is also active in the renewable energy space. Reinsurance engineering premiums from renewable energy power generation have seen strong growth of 20% per year over the past decade and accounted for more than 60% of total engineering premiums for power generation in 2022.\n\n- 1 The net-zero transition, McKinsey & Company, 2022.\n- 2 World Energy Outlook 2021, International Energy Agency 2021, https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021.\n- 3 Assuming the electricity produced by the renewable facility replaces currently produced electricity with average CO2 emissions per kWh for advanced markets.\n\n## Business solutions that tackle energy transition risks\n\nExamples of recent deals that tackle energy transition risks include:\n\n## Expanding South Korea's offshore wind\n\ncapacity: As the lead reinsurer for the construction of three offshore wind farm projects, Swiss Re has been supporting the development of renewable energy in South Korea. Once the final construction phase is complete in 2025, these projects will have a capacity of approximately 190MW. Swiss Re has also provided technical advice and risk management expertise for several additional projects whose construction is set to begin in 2025. With a total planned capacity of 5GW, these projects represent approximately one third of Korea's target to reach 12GW of offshore wind capacity by 2030.\n\n## Helping to unlock financing for the transition to renewable energy: In 2022,\n\nSwiss Re Corporate Solutions partnered with the German bank NORD/LB to establish a co-investment programme to facilitate the financing of renewable energy projects. This partnership combines NORD/LB's track record in\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nstructuring renewable energy investments with Swiss Re Corporate Solutions' expertise in credit risk-management solutions for banks. As part of the co-investment programme, NORD/LB originates and arranges eligible loans, following which Swiss Re Corporate Solutions insures a portion of NORD/ LB's credit risk, covering the bank in the event of non-payment by the borrower. By using pre-agreed eligibility criteria, the investment programme allows for more efficient deployment of financing to renewable energy projects by enabling the bank to reduce credit risk, optimise its portfolio and extend larger loans for such projects. At the end of 2022, Swiss Re had supported six renewable energy projects, which will contribute 1 300MW of additional power generation capacity once the assets are operational.\n\nRead more about these solutions in the Sustainability Report, page 24.",

        "page_content": "## Resilience under different climate scenarios\n\nScenario analyses for natural catastrophe re/insurance as well as life & health confirmed Swiss Re's view that climate change is only one of many risk drivers and it does not pose a fundamental threat to the resilience of Swiss Re for its re/insurance risk taking.\n\nFor natural catastrophe re/insurance, Swiss Re's research has shown that for the peak exposures, the projected increases of the annual expected loss (AEL) do not exceed historic trends, even for the most severe scenario.\n\nQuantitative scenario analysis focusing on climate only is therefore an inadequate instrument for driving today's underwriting decisions. Regularly updating natural catastrophe models and diversification with regards to regions, lines of business, sectors and clients is more relevant.\n\nSwiss Re uses qualitative and quantitative scenario analyses to assess the resilience of its strategy under different climate scenarios. The scenarios by the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) serve as the common narrative for the analysis of investment and underwriting portfolios.\u00b9 The NGFS scenarios incorporate different degrees of transition risks along different paths of global warming in the selected orderly, disorderly and hot house scenario:\n\n- \u00b7 Orderly: Climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent. Net-zero CO2 emissions achieved before 2070, resulting in a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C. Physical and transition risks are both relatively low.\n- \u00b7 Disorderly: Climate policies are delayed or divergent across countries and sectors. Emission reductions need to be sharper than in the orderly scenario to limit warming to the same target. The result is higher transition risk.\n- \u00b7 Hot house world: Some climate policies are implemented in some jurisdictions, but global efforts to limit warming are insufficient. Emissions grow until 2080, potentially leading to 3\u00b0C+ of warming until 2100 and severe physical risks.\n\nThe NGFS scenarios are linked to Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios, which Swiss Re uses for natural catastrophe re/insurance.\u00b2 Differences of the projected physical impacts between RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in the short to medium term (ie in the next ten years), but also in the long term (ie 2050) are minor, however, a considerable divergence is expected for the second half of the 21st century. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty within a single scenario (eg RCP 8.5), mainly caused by different modelling assumptions used in various climate models.\n\n## Property natural catastrophe re/insurance\n\nThe scenario work revealed that the expected climatic changes for tropical cyclones in the US and in Japan over the next 30 years are manageable for Swiss Re. The projected increases of AEL are small with 0.3-0.6% per year for a constant market portfolio (RCP 8.5, medium impact). Under the most severe scenario AEL are\n\n## Emissions\n\nRepresentative NGFS scenarios\u00b9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: NGFS\n\n- 1 Swiss Re's analysis is based on the representative scenarios of the Phase I NGFS Climate scenarios.\n- 2 RCP scenarios represent possible future concentration trajectories of greenhouse gases. The scenarios are named after the resulting radiative forcing at the end of the 21st century, eg 8.5W/m2 for RCP8.5, where no mitigation measures nor technical innovation will limit temperature increases. SSP narratives describe alternative pathways for future society.\n- 3 See Swiss Re TCFD report 2021, page 166-168 for details.\n\nforecast to increase 1.6-2.2% (RCP 8.5, severe impact). This is less than the increase of normalised insured losses from weatherrelated natural catastrophes over the past three decades (3% per year).\u00b3\n\nLooking at climate effects in isolation, as in the scenario pilot, means ignoring the other factors that will shape Swiss Re's future re/insurance book and thus also future AEL. These factors include, but are not limited to, strategy and underwriting risk appetite which can be redefined during the annual renewal process of property re/insurance business, market conditions, capital costs, insurance penetration, socio-economic developments, resilience of buildings or infrastructure against storms, and other climate adaptation measures. Since Swiss Re's re/insurance book and current AEL are the result of a complex interaction between all of these factors, any scenario analysis over the 2050 time horizon would have to consider them, in the process rendering the impact of climate change on the resulting AEL marginal.\n\nThe scenario work has provided limited steering insight. In view of the short-tail nature of property natural catastrophe business, there is no need for Swiss Re to",

        "page_content": "act today in anticipation of possible long-term future changes in the risk from extreme weather events while ignoring relevant factors, including adaptation and mitigation measures.\n\nFor decision-relevant analytics, it is important to understand today's risk landscape, including the current climate, irrespective of whether the changes are caused by climate change or natural variability, and whether current market prices reflect the risk level. Swiss Re has therefore made significant efforts over the past decade to embed climate change and other relevant risk drivers into key risk models and to model a present day/near future risk landscape rather than relying on an average of the recent past.\n\n## Swiss Re's strategy to ensure resilience of its property business in a changing climate\n\n- 1.  Diversification of insured natural hazards with regard to regions, lines of business, sectors and clients.\n- 2.  Flexible management and steering of weather-related exposure through limited duration of re/insurance contracts (typically one-year contracts for property insurance) as well as active portfolio steering (see Costing of weather-related perils in property, pages 154-155).\n- 3.  Regular updates of Swiss Re's in-house natural catastrophe models to ensure adequate costing of natural hazards for the current and near-term climate and socio-economic environment.\n- 4.  A qualitative scenario process to assess the most material impacts of climatic and socio-economic trends that affect insured risks. This is supported by quantitative assessments of the likely range of expected changes to determine their materiality over different time horizons and emission pathways.\n\n## Life & health re/insurance\n\nSwiss Re does not expect any of the analysed climate scenarios to have a major impact on its life & health portfolio, as excess mortality from heat is likely to be offset by lower mortality due to cold temperatures in the regions with Swiss Re's largest life & health exposures.\n\nFor life & health, the scientific research on the impact of climate change on health and mortality is still too limited to reliably inform quantitative scenario work. Furthermore, when considering the impact of climate change on health outcomes, other key variables also play a significant role. These include, but are not limited to, age, gender, health comorbidities and socioeconomic status, and non-uniformity across regions (see Climate strategy, page 156). Qualitative approaches therefore remain the best method for assessing risks from climate change for Swiss Re's life & health businesses.\n\nIn the interests of providing directional vectors, Swiss Re derived excess mortality projections from academic literature and expert reports. The projections cover the effects related to air pollution, heat and cold, and provide some directional guidance on the expected long-term trends in mortality. However, the results apply to the general population, which has a different structure than Swiss Re's portfolio of insured lives, and the forecasts are subject to a very high degree of uncertainty.\n\nUnder the more likely climate scenarios RCP 2.6 and RCP 4.5, a low level of net excess mortality is anticipated globally until 2100. In North America and Europe, the regions where Swiss Re's portfolio is concentrated, no excess mortality is expected. Increased mortality from heat is expected to be offset by large reductions in mortality from cold temperatures attributable to causes such as respiratory viruses and fewer deaths due to old age, as climate change reduces the severity of winters.\n\nA pessimistic scenario of unmitigated climate change (RCP 8.5) may result in global excess mortality of up to 5% in 2100. Again, the impacts will be concentrated in regions where Swiss Re does not currently have significant portfolio exposure.\n\nSwiss Re expects that access to mitigation measures, less exposure to environmental factors compared to the general population and better health of the insured population would lead to better outcomes for Swiss Re's portfolio compared to the general population - and in some scenarios, Swiss Re could even see a modest mortality improvement.\n\n## Casualty re/insurance\n\nSwiss Re closely monitors the climate change litigation (CCL) landscape, potential claims scenarios and their impact on its casualty book (see page 157). Swiss Re also assesses the CCL activity and how such activity may develop under different scenarios. While it is probable that CCL activity will continue in all scenarios, it is likely to increase in the hot house and disorderly world.",

The climate action approach comprises four steps to align the portfolio with a 1.5\u00b0C world by 2050: set targets, take action, measure and report.\n\nIn alignment with Swiss Re's commitment made as a founding member of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA), it set intermediate climate targets in 2020, to be achieved by 2025 1 (see Climate targets, page 174), with the aim to transition the investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.

Swiss Re considers these transition risks to be mainly relevant in the short to medium term 3 for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolios, as well as the Swiss and German real estate portfolio. The key risk faced by asset owners is that a changing policy and regulatory environment, such as increased taxes and/or new regulations, may impact asset values. The devaluation of investments can result in a specific company or a particularly exposed industry becoming a stranded asset in investment portfolios.\n\nFurthermore, governments and regulators have accelerated the development of (mandatory) reporting requirements and risk assessments to steer and transition climate change-related market activities towards more sustainable alternatives. Swiss Re also recognises that litigation risk for companies remains elevated. While Swiss Re considers these transition risks to be tilted to the short to medium term 3 , the carbon intensity reduction targets for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolio, as well as the Swiss and German real estate portfolio can also be seen as a way to manage these risks to a certain extent.\n\n- 1 The achievement of targets is measured at year-end 2024, and must be reported in 2025.\n- 2 Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme.\n- 3 Short term: < 5 years, medium term: 5-10 years, long term: 10 years and more.\n\n- \u00b7 Topic: Alignment of business model with 1.5\u00b0C target\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

Furthermore, the Own The Way You Work\u2122 Programme, which was introduced in 2013, offers employees full flexibility in their work arrangements through the use of laptops and seamless access to a Swiss Re Virtual Workplace.\n\nSound risk management, underwriting and asset management lie at the core of Swiss Re's businesses. This enables Swiss Re to use existing processes and instruments to address climaterelated risks.\n\n## Re/insurance activities and own operations\n\n## Physical risks\n\n## Property re/insurance\n\nNatural catastrophes are the key risk in Swiss Re's P&C re/insurance risk landscape, besides man-made risks. Climate changerelated risks are not considered a risk category of their own, as their impact is reflected in the established risk categories where relevant.\n\nSwiss Re has sophisticated risk models for all relevant natural catastrophe risks such as tropical cyclones, floods, winter storms and earthquakes. The models are based on the latest research and are updated both regularly and ad-hoc, if required. The updates make use of new scientific findings, including from research collaborations with academic institutions, and advances in computing and modelling capabilities.\n\nSwiss Re's proprietary property natural catastrophe risk models are important tools for managing the business: they are used to determine the loss costs, the economic capital required to support the risks on Swiss Re's books as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity to different lines of business.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risks\n\nSwiss Re identifies, monitors and assesses transition risks as well as any relevant legal developments.\n\nSwiss Re has risk monitoring in place for all types of transition risks described on pages 157-158. Technological developments are monitored through Swiss Re's respective underwriting units and the pricing of associated covers is reviewed annually.\n\nTo address some of the residual transition risks related to carbon-intense industries, Swiss Re is developing a carbon risk steering mechanism. Its key component will be a carbon risk model designed to measure the carbon intensity and associated risks embedded in the re/insurance business. The related policies are described on this page. For further information about the mechanism, see Climate metrics and targets, page 173.\n\n## General sustainability risks in Swiss Re's re/insurance business\n\nSwiss Re's ESG Risk Framework is a risk management instrument that enables the company to identify, assess and address environmental, social and human rights risks, as well as governance-related risks. This framework applies to Swiss Re's business activities, including re/insurance transactions and investments, where information granularity is available and a meaningful ESG risk assessment is possible. Two policies in the ESG Risk Framework are particularly relevant in the context of climate change: the Thermal Coal Policy and the Oil and Gas Policy.\n\n## Thermal Coal Policy\n\nSince 2018, Swiss Re no longer provides direct insurance or facultative reinsurance 1 to businesses with more than 30% exposure to thermal coal utilities or mining. The policy applies to both old and new thermal coal projects and across all lines of business, and marked the first step towards the development of a carbon steering mechanism. For transactions in low- and middle-income countries that derive more than 70% of electricity from coal, existing power plants (ie operational before 2018) can be covered until 2025, if there is evidence that the insured is implementing an effective emission-reduction strategy.\n\nSwiss Re has fully implemented the Thermal Coal Policy for direct insurance and facultative reinsurance business. In 2022, Swiss Re prepared the implementation of the Thermal Coal Policy extension for reinsurance treaties. The treaty policy extension defines thresholds for coal exposures in treaties across property, engineering, casualty, credit and surety, and marine cargo lines of business.\n\nThresholds for reinsurance treaty business came into effect at the beginning of 2023 and will then be gradually lowered until the final phase-out targets are reached; for OECD countries by 2030 and for non-OECD countries by 2040.\n\n## Oil and Gas Policy\n\nSince July 2021, Swiss Re no longer provides direct insurance or facultative reinsurance\u00b9 covers for those oil and gas companies that are responsible for the world's 5% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production. From July 2023, this threshold will increase to exclude the 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production companies.\n\nSince July 2022, Swiss Re no longer provides direct insurance or facultative reinsurance\u00b9 to companies and projects with more than 10% of their production located in the Arctic AMAP region (Norwegian production is exempt).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo learn more about the Swiss Re ESG Risk Framework and the thermal coal and oil and gas policies, please visit the Swiss Re website.\n\nFrom January 2023, Swiss Re no longer provides direct insurance or facultative reinsurance 1 for new oil or gas field projects.\n\nExceptions will apply such as for companies that are aligned with net-zero GHG emissions by 2050 as per SBTi validation or a comparable credible third-party assessment. Swiss Re continues to partner with energy clients on the net-zero transition and will align the company's re/insurance support to oil and gas companies according to the following ambitions:\n\n- \u00b7 By 2025, half of Swiss Re's overall direct and facultative premium income are to come from oil and gas companies that are aligned with net zero by 2050 as per SBTi validation or a comparable credible third-party assessment.\n- \u00b7 By 2030, Swiss Re's oil and gas re/insurance portfolios will only contain companies that are aligned with net zero by 2050 as per SBTi validation or a comparable credible third-party assessment.\n\nSwiss Re is currently developing an approach for oil and gas in treaty reinsurance and will communicate on progress later in 2023.",

By monitoring the portfolio GHG consumption and applying scenario analysis, Swiss Re assesses and manages\n\nthese risks using a structured approach. The table below shows an overview of the identified risks faced by Swiss Re (see Transition and physical risks, page 163) and how they are linked to the NGFS scenarios (see page 161).

In that regard, Swiss Re systematically monitors the carbon intensity of its corporate bond, listed equity and government bond portfolios, as well as parts of its real estate portfolio.\n\nAdditionally, Swiss Re uses temperature alignment methods to track forward-looking indicators for the corporate bond and listed equity portfolios. Temperature scores can provide signalling and reflect how a company's emissions translate into global warming, and thus, where it stands on its decarbonisation journey. At this stage, Swiss Re uses the temperature alignment outputs mainly for internal purposes such as to identify portfolio leaders and laggards (see Climate metrics and targets, page 179).\n\nIn order to proactively manage the increasing risk of stranded assets, Swiss Re has taken action by applying fossil fuel-related exclusions and guidelines (see Climate strategy, page 164).",

        "page_content": "## Scenario analysis\n\nSwiss Re assesses the transition and physical risks arising from climate change under different climate change scenarios. In 2022, Swiss Re enhanced its analytical capabilities by running scenario pilots on different portfolios for the three specific NGFS climate scenarios Orderly, Disorderly and Hot house world.\n\nTo derive the investment portfolio's sensitivity under the three scenarios, focus is placed on corporate bonds and listed equity for the Orderly and Disorderly scenarios, while real assets are in scope for the Hot house world scenario.\n\nOrderly: The orderly transition assumes timely action taken by the real economy to reduce emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement. This transition typically involves the immediate introduction of binding carbon prices and the availability of carbon-removal technologies, leading to net-zero GHG emissions between 2050 and 2070. Swiss Re's emission reduction targets for corporate bonds and listed equity are based on the IPCC 1.5\u00b0C pathway scenarios. Reducing the carbon intensity according to the target trajectory puts these asset classes on a decarbonisation pathway consistent with an orderly scenario in the short to medium term. Swiss Re's investment portfolio therefore had a low transition risk at the end of 2022. In this case, the economic impact on the portfolio is estimated to be low in the short term but can be higher for certain (especially energy intense) sectors if carbon costs increase. The listed equity portfolio has been assessed as being more vulnerable than the corporate bond portfolio, due to its larger exposure in energy-intensive sectors, buildings and agriculture. The corporate bonds' vulnerability in an orderly transition is low, with utilities expected to be impacted most by the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\nGiven the economy itself still has to align to a 1.5\u00b0C world, the exposure to transition risk may change over time, in particular for carbon-intensive industries. The investee companies need to further reduce their carbon intensities such that the portfolio remains consistent with an orderly 1.5\u00b0C trajectory post-2030/2035.\n\nDisorderly: A disorderly (ie late, disruptive) transition is consistent with the same expected temperature increase as in an orderly scenario, but with higher transition risk and cost associated with the transition. In this scenario, the delayed introduction of a carbon price leads to a higher starting point of the same and to a shorter period of time until net zero has to be reached. The transition therefore happens in a more disruptive manner compared to an orderly transition, which also impacts companies beyond the energy-intensive sectors. For the listed equity and corporate bond portfolios, Swiss Re expects a significant economic impact for climate-exposed industries, with higher vulnerability for companies and industries that did not adapt to climate change early on.\n\nHot house world: A hot house world scenario is expected to materialise through physical risks as economies will be exposed to physical damages on a larger scale due to the absence of sufficient transition actions. The physical risk analysis for Swiss Re's portfolio was done for real assets with clearly identifiable locations within Swiss Re's private debt portfolio (infrastructure debt and commercial mortgage loans), commercial mortgagebacked securities and real estate holdings. Swiss Re used its proprietary modelling tool Swiss Re Climate Risk Scores (see page 159) to calculate stresses and to assess the impact of an increase in severity and frequency of climate-related risks on the portfolios. Furthermore, portfolio changes under the different warming scenarios were modelled and evaluated. The results of both analyses suggest a low exposure of Swiss Re's real asset holdings to natural perils in general and to climate-related perils in particular, which translates into low to medium risks in the next 30-50 years. The low climate impacts are primarily tied to the portfolio's exposure to low risk locations, and cannot be interpreted as physical climate risks being low in general.",

Gross premiums written, annual expected losses, expected profit, reserves and risk model metrics such as tail value at risk (tail VaR) or value at risk (VaR) are used to identify financially material portfolios.\n\n## Premium income related to natural catastrophes (USD billion)\n\n|       |   2020 |   2021 |   2022 |\n|-------|--------|--------|--------|\n| World |    3.7 |    3.9 |    4.8 |\n\nFor losses exceeding USD 20 million. Net of external expenses such as brokerage and commissions.\n\n## Annual expected losses\n\nSwiss Re uses annual expected losses (AEL) from weather-related perils by region and peak scenario to identify material portfolios that are potentially exposed to changes in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events due to climate change.\n\nThese AEL can also be used as an indicator for the average current underwriting exposure to natural catastrophes caused by extreme weather. However, AEL figures do not, by definition, provide an adequate measure for the loss potential of individual years with exceptionally intense natural catastrophes. Adequate metrics for the risk of individual rare natural catastrophes are VaR or tail VaR. For example, the 99.5% VaR measures the loss likely to be exceeded in only one year out of two hundred, see Financial Report page 69, where the results of insurance risk stress tests are provided for the peak insurance risks.\n\nThe AEL figures are the result of modelled extreme weather events, the vulnerability of insured assets and operations, their values and the volume and structure of insurance products. There are many drivers for changes of AEL, but the main factor is portfolio changes in the assumed insurance risk on the back of market dynamics. Furthermore, model adjustments for physical climate change risk, changes in the vulnerability of insured assets and operations, and their values or changes in the Group's business strategy are other drivers of change. AEL figures are updated on an annual basis and are used to identify the largest portfolios exposed to weather-related catastrophes that could be impacted by climate change.\n\nThe table on the next page shows the AEL by region and peril as well as the highest AEL for Swiss Re's business as of year-end 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nDownload all the data in the TCFD and the Sustainability Report from the Swiss Re website (Excel).",

        "page_content": "## Transition risk\n\nSince 2018, Swiss Re has been using weighted average carbon intensities as proposed by the CRO Forum to identify the most carbon-intense direct insurance portfolios. Gross premiums written is used as the weight for calculating revenue-based greenhouse gas (GHG) intensities.\n\nCompany data for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, as well as estimated sectoral data are used as a basis. There are, however, still significant limitations to data availability, and carbon footprint estimates for re/insurance underwriting are thus marked by considerable uncertainty.\n\nTo support its ambition of achieving net zero in underwriting, Swiss Re is developing a comprehensive carbon steering mechanism. This includes the quantification of Swiss Re's absolute GHG emissions and associated risks related to its re/insurance business. In 2022, Swiss Re assumed a leading role in various industry initiatives establishing standards for measuring GHG emissions associated with insurance portfolios (so-called insurance-associated emissions (IAE)), as well as on how to set related targets (see box on the right).\n\nIn light of the new standards, Swiss Re is updating its carbon accounting approach with new and enhanced data sources and estimates.\u00b9 Swiss Re plans to publish the IAE of its direct and facultative re/insurance portfolios as well as a related interim target by July 2023 on its website. Carbon intensities will continue to be used for internal risk analyses.\n\n## Swiss Re taking a leading role in the NZIA and PCAF working groups\n\nThe UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) is a group of 30 leading re/insurers who have individually committed to transitioning their underwriting portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050.\n\nSwiss Re was one of the eight founding members of NZIA in 2021. In 2022, it assumed an important role, serving as the Chair of the NZIA Metrics and Targets Workstream. The NZIA collaborated with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) to develop the Accounting and Reporting Standard for Insurance-Associated Emissions. Swiss Re chaired the PCAF Working Group and also led the work on the NZIA Target-Setting Protocol.\n\nThe PCAF Working Group started its work in October 2021. Following a targeted consultation with key stakeholders and a public consultation in July 2022, the first version of the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for InsuranceAssociated Emissions was successfully launched in November 2022. This is the first methodology that provides guidance on measuring and disclosing GHG emissions associated with commercial lines and personal motor lines direct insurance and facultative reinsurance portfolios.\n\nThe first version of the Standard can be applied to more than 70% of the global property and casualty primary insurance market. It doesn't cover treaty reinsurance, the majority of Swiss Re's business, but, the working group aims to extend its scope further. The global, standardised methodology is intended to provide re/insurers with deeper insight\n\ninto the risk profile of their respective underwriting portfolios, stimulate innovative approaches to decarbonisation and create comparability for stakeholders.\n\nIn parallel, the NZIA has started working on a Target-Setting Protocol. This protocol sets out the NZIA's recommended approach to target setting and reporting. The goal was to support re/insurers in beginning to set science-based, interim decarbonisation targets for their respective insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios in line with a net-zero transition pathway that would limit global warming this century to 1.5\u00b0 C. In November 2022, a public consultation on the draft protocol provided an opportunity for the wider insurance industry (eg other re/insurers, brokers, insurance associations and initiatives) and key stakeholders (eg insurance regulators and supervisors, rating agencies, policymakers, civil society organisations/NGOs) to provide feedback.\n\n## Version 1.0 of the Target-Setting Protocol\n\nwas published in January 2023. It defines five different target types within the three categories 'emission reductions', 'engagement' and 'other' (other currently only contains the target type re/insuring the transition). NZIA members have committed to publishing at least one individual and companyspecific target by July 2023. A year later, they must publish at least three targets that cover all three categories.\n\nWork in the NZIA Metrics and Targets Workstream will remain crucial in order to expand the scope of guidance on measuring and disclosing Insurance-Associated Emissions, and setting science-based interim and long-term targets.",

        "page_content": "## Investments\n\nAs part of its climate action approach and transition to a net-zero GHG emissions investment portfolio by 2050, Swiss Re sets intermediate targets every five years and regularly reports on them. Targets were set in 2020 for 2025 in accordance with the AOA Target Setting Protocol (TSP) version 1. The targets aspire to align Swiss Re's investment portfolio with a 1.5\u00b0C world, and include financing transition, engagement, sub-portfolio and sector targets.\n\n## Climate targets\n\n## Financing transition\n\nGreen bonds contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy. By the end of 2022, Swiss Re held USD 2.7 billion in green bonds. As part of Swiss Re's transition strategy, its mandate also considers social and sustainability bonds, which enable a company to support underserved groups or populations, thus having a positive impact on society. Swiss Re's ambition is to achieve an investment portfolio of USD 4 billion of green, social and sustainability bonds by the end of 2024. Swiss Re held USD 3.8 billion in green, social and sustainability bonds per year-end 2022. The decrease in the amount of green bonds compared with year-end 2021 is due to higher yields, which outweighed purchases (after offsetting matured bonds). Bonds are only counted for target achievement if they meet all four components of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green or Social Bond Principles, or the ICMA Sustainability Bond Guidelines. In 2022, less than 7% did not pass the review and were therefore not included in the reporting of Swiss Re's green, social and sustainability bond holdings.\n\nIn alignment with the aspiration to finance the transition, Swiss Re has also set a target to deploy additional capital of USD 750 million\u00b9 in social and renewable energy infrastructure debt, including energy efficiency, by the end of 2024 relative to year-end 2019. As of 31 December 2022, it invested a total of USD 751 million compared with the base year, thus reaching the target ahead of time.\n\n## Green, social and sustainability bond holdings since target inception (USD billion)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nIn 2022, Swiss Re evaluated the reporting requirements for its carbon-intensive energy infrastructure debt portfolio as defined in the AOA TSP version 2. As the direct holdings are close to nil, the position is considered as not material from a reporting perspective.\n\n## Engagement\n\nSwiss Re believes that engagement with the real economy is an integral component for supporting the limitation of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. In 2020, it therefore established an Engagement Framework supporting the aspired emission reduction described in the sub-portfolio paragraph below and the real-world transition to a low-carbon economy. For additional information on Swiss Re's stewardship activities, see the Sustainability Report 2022, pages 39-40.\n\n## Sub-portfolio\n\nSwiss Re is committed to transitioning its investment portfolio to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Informed by IPCC's 2 pathways consistent with global warming of 1.5\u00b0C, Swiss Re introduced a target for the combined corporate bond and listed equity portfolio to reduce its carbon intensity by\n\n- 1 Based on original face values.\n- 2 IPCC (2018).

Furthermore, Swiss Re set a target to reduce the carbon intensity for its Swiss and German real estate investment portfolio by 5% with 2018 as the base year, to be achieved by year-end 2024. For information on the progress made against these targets, see Climate metrics, pages 175-178.\n\n## Sector\n\nCoal assets are particularly carbon intensive and susceptible to becoming stranded given the long life of these assets, as well as the evolving regulations on carbon emissions. Swiss Re aims to fully exit coal-related assets for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolios via normal portfolio reallocations by 2030. Further, Swiss Re does not invest in fossil fuelrelated companies that are above certain thresholds, as described in the Climate strategy section, page 164.",

A lower carbon intensity was achieved by reducing the allocation to utilities, but also by overweighting companies with more favourable intensities within the same industry. Further, the change in reported intensities shows that there was a broader market trend across companies to reduce their carbon emission intensity.

In 2019, Swiss Re committed to reaching net-zero GHG emissions across its operations by 2030. Following the standardisation work undertaken by SBTi in 2021 and 2022, Swiss Re has decided to embed these definitions and high-level principles in its CO2NetZero Programme for operational emissions, while voluntarily continuing to go beyond SBTi's minimum requirements and bearing in mind that net zero is still a concept under development for financial institutions.\n\nSwiss Re's transition path to net zero consists of three elements:\n\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re focuses on reducing GHG emissions within its operational value chain as much and as quickly as possible, setting both near-term and long-term science-based reduction targets that are aligned with a 1.5\u00b0C-compatible pathway. At the end of 2022, near-term targets for operational emissions were submitted to the SBTi for validation (see Sustainability Report 2022, page 17 for details on the targets). Long-term targets will be developed after the release of the applicable standard for financial institutions (see Sustainability Report 2022, Net zero for financial institutions, page 52 for further background).\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re is keen to support the development of the carbon removal market through early engagement. The Group has set a voluntary target to purchase 100% carbon removal certificates as early as 2030, fully covering the remaining operational emissions that are in scope for compensation in that year.\u00b2\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re will continue to compensate its remaining emissions with carbon avoidance and removal certificates\u00b3, linerarily increasing the share of carbon removal certificates purchased annually from 0% in 2020 to 100% in 2030. Both certificate types will continue to meet Swiss Re's quality criteria in terms of integrity, durability, scalability and social co-benefits. This voluntary course of action is encouraged by SBTi and defined as 'beyond value chain mitigation'.\n\nThese three elements are encapsulated in the motto 'Do our best, remove the rest'. See Sustainability Report 2022, pages 54-57 for more information on the principal measures Swiss Re has recently taken under this motto.\n\n## The Carbon Steering Levy\n\nIn early 2021, Swiss Re became the first multinational company to introduce an ambitious triple-digit real internal carbon price on both direct and indirect operational GHG emissions. It covers all Scope 1, all Scope 2 (market-based) and a significant part of upstream Scope 3 emissions (ie business travel, fuel and energy-related activities, paper, water and waste) across all of the Group's Business Units, functions and locations.\n\nIn 2022, the internal price per tonne of CO2e (Carbon Steering Levy) was set at USD 112 - up from USD 100 in 2021. This increase is part of the plan to gradually raise the levy to USD 200 per tonne of CO2e by 2030, which reflects the expected market price for high-quality carbon removal certificates at that point in time.\n\n- 1 The commitment was based on the following definition of net zero: for every tonne of GHG that cannot be avoided, an equivalent amount of CO2 needs to be removed from the atmosphere and stored permanently.\n- 2 Swiss Re's operational GHG emissions in the current scope for compensation are Scope 1, Scope 2 and a significant part of upstream Scope 3 (ie business travel, fuel- and energy-related activities, paper, water and waste).\n- 3 Carbon removal certificates: emitters pay third parties for removing emissions from the atmosphere and store them durably (also known as 'carbon removals'). Carbon avoidance certificates: emitters pay third parties to avoid or reduce someone else's emissions (commonly known as 'carbon offsets').\n\nIn 2019, Swiss Re committed to reaching net-zero GHG emissions across its operations by 2030.\u00b9",

Prices will decrease over time as technologies and markets mature, but for high-quality removals they will likely remain above the level of Swiss Re's Carbon Steering Levy until the end of the decade. Meanwhile, conventional carbon offsets - including the high-quality ones Swiss Re has bought in the past and will continue to buy - are expected to remain available at prices well below its internal Carbon Steering Levy. Mixing higher-cost removals with cheaper offsets will make it possible to balance the Group's average carbon certificate price so it never exceeds the level of the Carbon Steering Levy in any given year.\n\nFinally, with its ten-year time horizon the Carbon Steering Levy helps eliminate planning uncertainty. In particular, it allows Swiss Re to source certificates through long-term purchase agreements, thus sending a strong signal to the market.\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions data disclosure\n\nIn 2022, Swiss Re's operational GHG emissions totalled 29 069 tonnes of CO2e\u00b9 - roughly a three-fold increase from the previous year, which was still strongly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Compared with 2018 operational emissions have decreased by 69% in absolute terms.\n\nSwiss Re has disclosed its operational environmental performance indicators, including GHG emissions and their relative performance over time since 2003, expanding the reporting scope with effect from 2013.\n\nIts operational GHG inventory is based on the guidelines of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Corporate Standard, the most widely used international standard for the accounting and reporting of GHG emissions.\n\nThe full disclosure of the Group's operational GHG emissions and the underlying environmental indicators for 2022 can be found in the Appendix of the Sustainability Report 2022, pages 72-75.\n\nWhile Swiss Re strives to continuously improve its calculation methodology for the GHG emissions within the current reporting boundary, it also acknowledges the existence of a large portion of operational Scope 3 categories with considerable measurement uncertainty. These emissions are reported only as initial estimates at present. Most of them stem from the activities in the Group's supply chain and are usually referred to as 'embodied emissions' in the buildings, products and services needed to run the core business operations. For an overview of Scope 3 operational GHG emissions, including estimates, please see page 183.\n\nThese Scope 3 emissions are difficult to quantify accurately because their sources are beyond Swiss Re's direct operational control; the corresponding accounting methodologies and data collection systems are not yet mature or standardised. Swiss Re understands the need to engage with its vendors on the topic of climate change mitigation. The future objectives of this collaboration are: identifying and measuring material emissions; setting science-based emission reduction targets; and decarbonising the Group's supply chain in line with the ambition of achieving net zero globally by 2050.",

(VfU);\n- -The GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance, effective since January 2015;\n- -Further internal policies and guidelines applied regarding the subject matter.\n\n## Inherent limitations\n\nDue to the inherent limitations of any internal control structure, it is possible that errors or irregularities may occur in disclosures of the Selected Sustainability Information and not be detected. Our engagement is not designed to detect all internal control weaknesses in the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information because the engagement was not performed on a continuous basis throughout the period and the audit procedures performed were on a test basis.\n\nThe Sustainability information disclosed in the Sustainability Report 2022 and TCFD reporting 2022 include retired carbon certificates for the year ended December 31, 2022. In total the retired carbon certificates amount to 25'034 tCO2 emissions and include both carbon avoidance certificates (76%) and carbon removal certificates (24%).

We have not, however, performed any procedures regarding the assumptions used in the calculation methodology for these certificates, and express no opinion about whether the retired carbon have resulted, or will result in, carbon emissions being avoided or removed.\n\n## Swiss Re's Responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Directors of Swiss Re is responsible for:\n\n- -Selecting or establishing suitable criteria for preparing the Selected Sustainability Information, taking into account applicable law and regulations related to reporting the Selected Sustainability Information;\n- -The preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information in accordance with the reporting criteria described under 'Understanding how Swiss Re has prepared the Selected Sustainability Information';\n- -Designing, implementing and maintaining internal control over information relevant to the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nWe are responsible for:\n\n- -Planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Selected Sustainability Information is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;\n- -Forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained; and\n- -Reporting our conclusion to the Directors of Swiss Re.\n\nAs we are engaged to form an independent conclusion on the Selected Sustainability Information as prepared by management, we are not permitted to be involved in the preparation of the Selected Sustainability Information as doing so may compromise our independence.\n\n## Professional Standards Applied\n\nWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) 'Assurance Engagements other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information' and in respect of greenhouse gas emissions, with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE 3410), 'Assurance Engagements on Greenhouse Gas Statements', issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board.\n\n## Our Independence and Quality Control\n\nWe have complied with the independence and other ethical requirements of the International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which is founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality, and professional behavior.\n\nOur firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent and multidisciplinary team including assurance practitioners and sustainability experts. We remain solely responsible for our assurance conclusion.",

The procedures we performed were based on our professional judgment. Carrying out our limited assurance engagement on the Selected Sustainability Information included, among others:\n\n- -Assessment of the design and implementation of systems, processes and internal controls for determining, processing and monitoring sustainability performance data, including the consolidation of data;\n- -Inquiries of employees responsible for the determination and consolidation as well as the implementation of internal control procedures regarding the selected disclosures;\n- -Inspection of selected internal and external documents to determine whether qualitative and quantitative information is supported by sufficient evidence and presented in an accurate and balanced manner;\n- -Assessment of the data collection, validation and reporting processes as well as the reliability of the reported data on a test basis and through testing of selected calculations;\n- -Analytical assessment of the data and trends of the quantitative disclosures in the scope of the limited assurance engagement;\n- -Assessment of the consistency of the disclosures in the scope of the assurance with the other disclosures and key figures in the Sustainability Report 2022 and the TCFD reporting 2022;\n- -Assessment of the overall presentation of the disclosures through critical reading of the Sustainability Report 2022 and the TCFD reporting 2022.\n\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and timing from, and are less in extent than for, a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had we performed a reasonable assurance engagement.\n\nKPMG AG\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSilvan Jurt\n\nLicensed audit expert\n\nZurich, March 15, 2023\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTheresa Tiersch\n\n\u00a9 2023 KPMG AG, a Swiss corporation, is a subsidiary of KPMG Holding AG, which is a member firm of the KPMG global organization of independent member firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group financial statements\n\n## 1 Organisation and summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Nature of operations\n\nThe Swiss Re Group, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, comprises Swiss Re Ltd (the parent company) and its subsid iaries (collectively, the 'Swiss Re Group' or the 'Group'). The Swiss Re Group is a wholesale provider of reinsurance, insurance and other insurance-based forms of risk transfer as well as other insurance-related services. Working through brokers and a network of offices around the globe, the Group serves a client base consisting of insurance companies, mid - to large-sized corporations and public-sector clients.\n\nSwiss Re Group consists of three business segments: Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health  Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and comply with Swiss law. All significant intra-group transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Swiss Re Ltd has decided that as of 1 January 2024 the Group's consolidated financial statements wi ll be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The impact of the adoption on the Group's financial statements is being assessed. Financial statements for periods ending on or prior to 31 December 2023 will continue to be prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe Group's financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of Swiss Re Ltd and its subsidiaries. Voting e ntities which Swiss Re Ltd directly or indirectly controls through holding a majority of the voting rights are consolidated in the Group's accounts. Variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated when the Swiss Re Group is the primary beneficiary. The Group is the primary benefi ciary when it has power over the activities that impact the VIE's economic performance and at the same time has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nCompanies which the Group does not control, but over which it directly or indirectly exercises sig nificant influence, are accounted for using the equity method or the fair value option and are included in other invested assets. The Swiss Re Group's share of net profi t or loss in investments accounted for under the equity method is included in net investment income. Equity and net income of these companies are adjusted as necessary to be in line with the Group's accounting policies. The results of consolidated subsidiaries and invest ments accounted for using the equity method are included in the financial statements for the period commencing from the date of acquisition.\n\n## Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the related disclosure, including contingent assets and liab ilities. The Swiss Re Group's liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and policy benefits for life and heal th include estimates for premium, claim and benefit data not received from ceding companies at the date of the financial statements. In addition, the Group use s certain financial instruments and invests in securities of certain entities for which exchange  trading does not exist. The Group determines these estimates based on historical information, actuarial analyses, financial modelling and other analytical techniques. Actual re sults could differ significantly from the estimates described above.\n\n## Foreign currency remeasurement and translation\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to the respective subsidiary's functional currency at average exchange rates. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at closing exchange rates, whereas non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at historical rates.\n\nRemeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities and trading securities are reported in earnings. Remeasurem ent gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, investments in consolidated subsidiaries and investments accounted for using the equity method are reported in shareholders' equity.\n\nFor consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars are trans lated from the functional currency to US dollars at closing rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reported in shareholders' equity.",

        "page_content": "## Valuation of financial assets\n\nThe fair value of the majority of the Group's financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets or observable  inputs. These instruments include government and agency securities, commercial paper, most investment-grade corporate debt, most high-yield debt securities, exchange-traded derivative instruments, most mortgage- and asset-backed securities and listed equity securities. In markets with reduced or no liquidity, spreads between bid and offer prices are normally wider compared to spreads in highly liquid markets. Such market conditions affect the valuation of certain asset classes of the Group, such as some asset -backed securities as well as certain derivative structures referencing such asset classes.\n\nThe Group considers both the credit risk of its counterparties and own risk of non -performance in the valuation of derivative instruments and other over-the-counter financial assets. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the assessment of the Group's exposure to the credit risk of its counterparties incorporates consideration of existing collateral and netting arrangements entered i nto with each counterparty. The measure of the counterparty credit risk is estimated by incorporating the observable credit spreads, where available, or credit spread estimates derived based on the benchmarking techniques where market data is not available. The impact of the Gr oup's own risk of non-performance is analysed in a manner consistent with the aforementioned approach, with consideration given to the Group's observable credit spreads. The value representing such risk is incorporated into the fair value of the financial instruments (primarily derivatives), in a liability position as of the measurement date. The change in this adjustment from period to period is reflected in realised investment gains and losses in the income statement.\n\nFor assets or derivative structures at fair value, the Group uses market prices or inputs deriv ed from market prices. A separate internal price verification process, independent of the trading function, provides an additional control over the market prices or market in puts used to determine the fair values of such assets. Although management considers that appropriate values have been ascribed to such assets, there is always a level of uncertainty and judgement related to these valuations. Subsequent valuations could differ significantly fro m the results of the process described above. The Group may become aware of counterparty valuations, either directly through the exchange of information or indirectly, for example through collateral demands. Any implied differences are considered in the independent price verifi cation process and may result in adjustments to initially indicated valuations. As of 31 December 2022, the Group had not provided any collateral on financial instruments in excess of its own market value estimates.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Group's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) or trading. Fixed income securities AFS are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the difference between the applicable measure of cost and fair val ue being recognised in shareholders' equity. Trading fixed income securities are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings. A trading classification is used for securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling the m in the near term.\n\nFor fixed income securities AFS that are other-than-temporary impaired and for which there is not an intention to sell, the impairment is separated into (i) the estimated amount relating to credit loss, and (ii) the amount relating to all other factors, including interest rates and associated foreign currency impacts. The estimated credit loss amount is recognised in earnings, with the remainder of the loss amount recognised in other comprehensive income. In cases where there is an intention or requirement to sell a nd the fair value is lower than cost expressed in functional currency terms, the cost of fixed income securities AFS is reduced to fair value, with a correspondin g charge to realised investment losses. Subsequent recoveries are not recognised in earnings.\n\nEquity investments are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings, with the exception of e quity method investments and investments that result in consolidation.\n\nInterest on fixed income securities is recorded in net investment income when earned and is adjusted for the amortisation of any purchase premium or discount. Dividends on equity securities are recognised as investment income on the ex -dividend date. Realised gains and losses on sales are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method.\n\nPolicy loans, mortgages and other loans are carried at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised in accordance with the e ffective yield method.\n\nInvestment in real estate that the Group intends to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated cost, net of any write -downs for impairment in value. Depreciation on buildings is recognised on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Land is recognised at cost and not depreciated. Impairment in value is recognised if the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the use of the real estate is lower than its carrying value. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset 's carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recognised in realised investment losses. Depreciation and other related charges or cred its are included in net investment income. Investment in real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, l ess estimated selling costs, and is not depreciated. Reductions in the carrying value of real estate held for sale are included in realised investment losses.\n\nShort-term investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in net in come. The Group considers highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of one year or less, but greater than three months, to be sh ort-term investments.\n\nOther invested assets include affiliated companies, equity accounted companies, derivative financial instruments, collateral receivables, securities purchased under agreement to resell, deposits and time deposits, and investments without readily determinable fair  value",

        "page_content": "(including limited partnership investments). Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest equals or exceeds 3% are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest is below 3% and equity  investments in corporate entities which are not publicly traded are accounted for at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognised in earnings.\n\nThe Group enters into securities lending arrangements under which it loans certain securities in exchange for collateral and receives securities lending fees. The Group's policy is to require collateral, consisting of cash or securities, equal to at least 102% of the carryin g value of the securities loaned. In certain arrangements, the Group may accept collateral of less than 102% if the structure of th e overall transaction offers an equivalent level of security. Cash received as collateral is recognised along with an obligation to return the cash . Securities received as collateral that can be sold or repledged are also recognised along with an obligatio n to return those securities. Securities lending fees are recognised over the term of the related loans.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, options, forwards a nd exchange-traded financial futures for the Group's trading and hedging strategy in line with the overall risk management strategy. Derivative financial instruments are primarily used as a means of managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purchases, existing assets or existing liabilities and also to lock in attractive investment conditions for funds which become available in the f uture. The Group recognises all of its derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value on derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in income.\n\nIf the derivative is designated as a hedge of the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair val ue of the derivative are recognised in earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If the derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular risk, changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognised in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in earnings. When hedge a ccounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge, the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified to earnings in the period in which the formerly hedged transaction is reported in earnings. When the Group discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within the required time period, the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value, and gains and losses that were previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are  recognised in earnings.\n\nThe Group recognises separately derivatives that are embedded within other host instruments if the economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and if it meets t he definition of a derivative if it were a free-standing contract.\n\nDerivative financial instrument assets are generally included in other invested assets and derivative financial instrument liabilities are generally included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\n\nThe Group also designates non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain foreign operations. From the inception of the hedging relationship, remeasurement gains and losses on the designated non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments and translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment are reported as translation gains and losses in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term deposits, certain short-term investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs\n\nThe Group incurs costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal reinsurance and insurance business. Some of these costs, which consist primarily of commissions, are deferred as they are directly related to the successful acquisition of such busine ss.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs for short-duration contracts are amortised in proportion to premiums earned. Deferred acquisition costs for traditional long-duration contracts are amortised over the life of underlying contracts based upon the present value of gross premiums. Deferred acquisition costs for universal-life type contracts and similar products are amortised based on the present value of estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are updated quarterly.\n\n## Modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially unchanged contract  as a continuation of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs and present value of future pr ofits (PVFP) will continue to be amortised. The Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially changed  contract as an extinguishment of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs or PVFP are written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.",

        "page_content": "The underlying assets and liabilities acquired are subsequently accounted for according to the relevant US GAAP  guidance. This includes specific requirements applicable to subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities recognised as part of the acquisition me thod of accounting, including present value of future profits, goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Acquired present value of future profits\n\nThe acquired present value of future profits (PVFP) of business in force is recorded in connection with the acquisition of li fe and health business. The initial value is calculated as the difference between established reser ves, which are set up in line with US GAAP accounting policies and assumptions of the Group, and their fair value at the acquisition date. The resulting PVFP, which could be posit ive or negative, is amortised on a constant yield basis over the expected revenue recognition period of the business acquired, generally over periods ranging up to 30 years, with the accrual of interest added to the unamortised balance at the earned rate. Amortisation and accrual of  interest are recognised in acquisition costs. The earned rate corresponds to either the current earned rate or the original earned rate depending on the business written. The rate is consistently applied for the entire life of the applicable business. For universal -life and similar products, PVFP is amortised in line with estimated gross profits, which are updated quarterly. The carrying value of PVFP is reviewed periodically for indicators of impairment in value. Adjustments to PVFP reflecting impairment in value are recognised in acquisition costs durin g the period in which the determination of impairment is made, or in other comprehensive income for shadow loss recognition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded a s goodwill. The goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of 30 September, unless there is an event or circumstances which makes an impairment more likely than not. Adjustments to reflect impairment in value are recognised in earnings in the period in which the determination of impairment is made.\n\n## Other assets\n\nOther assets include deferred expenses on retroactive reinsurance, prepaid reinsurance premiums, receivables related to inves ting activities, real estate for own use, other classes of property, plant and equipment, lease right-of-use asset, accrued income, certain intangible assets and prepaid assets.\n\nThe excess of estimated liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses payable over consideration received in respect o f retroactive property and casualty reinsurance contracts is recorded as a deferred expense. The deferred expense on retroactive reinsuranc e contracts is amortised through earnings over the expected claims-paying period.\n\nReal estate for own use as well as other classes of property, plant and equipment are carried at depreciated cost. Depreciation on buildings is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Land is recognised at cost and not depreciated.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group recognises for finance and operating leases a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right -of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease right-of-use asset is included in 'other assets' and the lease liability is included in 'accrued expenses and other liabilities' on the balance sheet. Lease expense for lease payments is re cognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAdditional disclosures are provided in Note 12 'Leases'.\n\n## Capitalised software costs\n\nExternal direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop or obtain software for internal use, payroll and payroll -related costs for employees directly associated with software development and interest cost incurred while developing software for internal use are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis through earnings over the estimated useful life.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised based on the difference between financial statement carryin g amounts and the corresponding income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is re corded against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax as sets may not be realised.\n\nThe Group recognises the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes i n recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgement occurs. Interest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense.\n\nThe Group releases stranded tax effects for unrealised gains/losses on AFS securities to earnings on a straight -line basis over the average duration of the relevant AFS portfolio as an approximation of when the individual securities within the portfolio are sold or mature. For adjustment for pension and other post-retirement benefits, stranded tax effects are released to earnings when the relevant pension plan is terminated. For foreign currency translation, stranded tax effects are released to earnings in line with the recycling of the underly ing foreign currency translation amounts.",

        "page_content": "## Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for property and casualty and for life and health insurance and reinsurance contracts are accrued when insured events occur and are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling the claims, using re ports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies. Reserves also are established for claims incurred but not reported, which are developed on the basis of past experience adjusted for current trends and other factors that modify past experience. The esta blishment of the appropriate level of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and judgements made by management, and therefore there can be no assurance that ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses will not exceed the loss reserves currently esta blished by the Group. These estimates are regularly reviewed, and adjustments for differences between estimates and actual payments for clai ms and for changes in estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the estimates are changed or payments are  made.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has continued to add some degree of uncertainty during 2022, both in respect of estimation of claims across the insurance and reinsurance industry and assessments of the wider potential global health and economic impacts.  The Group has recorded its best estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred as a result of the pandemic as of 31 December 2022, with the b est estimate reflecting the Group's expectations based on current facts and circumstances.\n\nThe Group does not discount liabilities arising from prospective property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, including liabilities which are discounted for US statutory reporting purposes. Liabilities arising from property and casualty insuranc e and reinsurance contracts acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with the acquisition method  of accounting.\n\nThe Group does not discount life and health claim reserves except for disability income claims in payment and mo rtality claims paid out in the form of an annuity. These claims are recognised at the estimated present value of the remaining ultimate net costs of the  incurred claims.\n\nExperience features which are directly linked to a reinsurance asset or liability are classified in a manner that is consistent with the presentation of that asset or liability.\n\n## Liabilities for life and health policy benefits\n\nLiabilities for life and health policy benefits from reinsurance business are generally calculated using the net lev el premium method, based on assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals, lapses and policyholder dividends. Assumptions are se t at the time the contract is issued or, in the case of contracts acquired by purchase, at the acquisit ion date. The assumptions are based on current best estimates, making allowance for possible adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions for life and health (re)insurance benefit liabilities are based on estimates of expected investment yields. Assumed mortality or morbidity rates are generally based on experience multiples applied to the actuarial select and ultimate tables based on industry experience.\n\n## Policyholder account balances\n\nPolicyholder account balances relate to universal-life-type contracts and investment contracts.\n\nUniversal-life-type contracts are long-duration insurance contracts, providing either death or annuity benefits, with terms that are not fixed and guaranteed.\n\nInvestment contracts are long-duration contracts that do not incorporate significant insurance risk, i.e. there is no mortality and morbidity risk, or the mortality and morbidity risk associated with the insurance benefit features offered in the contract is of insign ificant amount or remote probability. Amounts received as payment for investment contracts are reported as policyholder account balances. Related assets ar e included in general account assets except for investments for unit-linked, which are presented in a separate line item on the face of the balance sheet.\n\nAmounts assessed against policyholders for mortality, administration and surrender are reported as fee income. Amounts credit ed to policyholders are reported as interest credited to policyholders. Investment income and realised investment gains and losses allocable to policyholders are included in net investment income and net realised investment gains/losses except for unit-linked, which is presented in a separate line item on the face of the income statement.\n\nIn unit-linked contracts, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder. Additional disclosures are provided in Note 7 'Investments'.\n\n## Funds held assets and liabilities\n\nOn the asset side, funds held by ceding companies consist mainly of amounts retained by the ceding company for business written on a funds withheld basis. In addition, the account also includes amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of ac counting to ceded retrocession or reinsurance contracts.\n\nOn the liability side, funds held under reinsurance treaties consist mainly of amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting to inward insurance and reinsurance contracts. In addition, the account also includes amounts retained from ceded business written on a funds withheld basis.\n\nFunds withheld assets are assets that would normally be paid to the Group but are withheld by the cedent to reduce a potential credit risk or to retain control over investments. In case of funds withheld liabilities, it is the Group that withholds assets related to ceded business in order to reduce its credit risk or retain control over the investments.",

        "page_content": "The deposit method of accounting is applied to insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not indemnify the ceding company o r the Group against loss or liability relating to insurance risk. Under the deposit method of accounting, the deposit asset or liability is in itially measured based on the consideration paid or received. For contracts that transfer neither significant timing nor underwriti ng risk, and contracts that transfer only significant timing risk, changes in estimates of the timing or amounts of cash flows are accounted for by recal culating the effective yield. The deposit is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the contract. The revenue and expense recorded for such contracts is included in net investment income. For cont racts that transfer only significant underwriting risk, once a loss is incurred, the d eposit is adjusted by the present value of the incurred loss. At each subsequent balance sheet date, the portion of the deposit attributable to the incurred loss is recalculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows. The resulting changes in the carrying amount of the deposit are recognised in claims and claim adjustment expenses.\n\nFunds withheld balances are presented together with assets and liabilities arising from the application of the deposit method because of their common deposit-type character.\n\n## Premium deficiency testing\n\nThe level of the premium deficiency test is at the segment level or separate business within Group Items.  The testing is performed net of external retrocessions.\n\nFor long duration contracts, liabilities for life and health policy benefits are increased with a charge to earnings if there is a premium deficiency. A premium deficiency exists if the liability for future policy benefits calculated using best estimate cash flows , including investment income, is higher than the net GAAP liability. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferred acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition costs, t hen an additional liability will be established for the difference. In connection with the premium deficiency testing, an analysis is performed to determ ine that profits will not be followed by losses. The best estimate cash flows by year along with the change in the locked in GAAP r eserve are reviewed to determine that there are not any profits followed by losses. If so, an additional GAAP reserve is established by calculati ng the portion of future premiums required to be used as an additional reserve to offset the future losses.\n\nFor short duration contracts, a premium deficiency exists when the unearned premium plus expected investment income is less than the total of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, related estimated policy maintenance costs (incl.  unallocated loss adjustment expenses), related unamortised acquisition costs and expected dividends to policyholders. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferre d acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition cost, then a liability will be established for the difference.\n\n## Shadow adjustments\n\nShadow adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income reflecting the offset of adjustments to deferred acquisiti on costs and PVFP, typically related to universal-life-type contracts, and policyholder liabilities. The purpose is to reflect the fact that certain amounts recorded as unrealised investment gains and losses within shareholders' equity will ultimately accr ue to policyholders and not shareholders.\n\nShadow loss recognition testing becomes relevant in low interest rate environments. The test considers whether the hypothetical sale of AFS securities and the reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields would lead to negative operational earnings in future periods, thereby causing a loss recognition event. For shadow loss recognition testing, the Group uses current market yields to determine best estimate US GAAP reserves rather than using locked-in or current book yields. If the unlocked best estimate US GAAP reserves based on current market rates are in excess of reserves based on locked-in or current book yields, a shadow loss recognition reserve is set up. These reserves are recognised in other comprehensive income and do not impact net income. In addition, shadow loss recognition reserves can reverse up to the amount of losses recognised due to past loss events.\n\n## Premiums\n\nProperty and casualty reinsurance premiums are recorded when written and include an estimate for written premiums receivable at period end. Premiums earned are generally recognised in income over the contract period in proportion to the amount of reinsurance p rovided. Unearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided. Life re insurance premiums are earned when due. Related policy benefits are recorded in relation to the associated premium or gross profits so that profits are recognised over the e xpected lives of the contracts.\n\nLife and health reinsurance premiums for group coverages are generally earned over the term of the coverage. For group contracts that allow experience adjustments to premiums, such premiums are recognised as the related experience emerges.\n\nReinstatement premiums are due where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre-defined contract terms. The recognition of reinstatement premiums as written depends on individual contract features. Reinstatement premiums are either recognised as written at the time a loss event occurs or in line with the recognition pattern of premiums written of the underlying contract. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on actuarial estimates of ultimate losses. Reinstatement premiums are generall y earned in proportion to the amount of reinsurance provided.",

        "page_content": "## Insurance and reinsurance ceded\n\nThe Group uses retrocession arrangements to increase its aggregate underwriting capacity, to diversify its risk and to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss on reinsurance assumed. The ceding of risks to retrocessionaires does not relieve the Group of its obligations to its ceding companies. The Group regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and monitors the concentration of c redit risk to minimise its exposure to financial loss from retrocessionaires' insolvency. Premiums and losses ceded under retrocession contracts are reported as reductions of premiums earned and claims and claim adjustment expenses. Amounts recoverable for ceded short - and longduration contracts, including universal-life-type and investment contracts, are reported as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Group provides reserves for uncollectible amounts on reinsurance balances ceded, based on management's assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances.\n\n## Receivables\n\nPremium and claims receivables which have been invoiced are accounted for at face value. Together with assets arising from th e application of the deposit method of accounting that meet the definition of financing receivables they are regularly assessed for impairment. Evidence of impairment is the age of the receivable and/or any financial difficulties of the counterparty. Allowances are set up on the n et balance, meaning all balances related to the same counterparty are considered. The amount of the allowance is set up in relation to the time a receivable has been due and any financial difficulties of the debtor and can be as high as the outstanding net balance.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs using the accrual method of accounting. Amounts charged to expense are based on periodic actuarial determinations.\n\n## Share-based payment transactions\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group has a Leadership Performance Plan (LPP)/Leadership Share Plan (LSP), restricted shares and a Global Share Participation Plan. These plans are described in more detail in Note 16 'Share-based payments'. The Group accounts for share-based payment transactions with employees using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, the fair value of the awards is recognised i n earnings over the vesting period.\n\nFor share-based compensation plans which are settled in cash, compensation costs are recognised as liabilities, whereas for equity-settled plans, compensation costs are recognised as an accrual to additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are reported at cost in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Earnings per common share\n\nBasic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares entitled to dividends during the year. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the effect on earnings an d average common shares outstanding associated with dilutive securities.\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 15 March 2023. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.\n\n## Adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04, 'Modification of equity-classified written call options', an update to Topic 260, 'Earnings per share', to Topic 470-50, 'Debt - Modification and Extinguishments', to Topic 718, 'Compensation - Stock Compensation', and to Topic 815-40, 'Derivatives and Hedging - Contract in Entity's Own Equity'. The amendments in this update clarify and reduce diversity in the accounting by issuers for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The Group adopted the standard on 1 January 2022. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group' s financial statements.\n\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-05, 'Lessors - Certain Leases with Variable Lease Payments', an update to Topic 842, 'Leases'. The amendments in this update address stakeholders' concerns by amending the lease classification requirements for lessors to  align them with practice under Topic 840. A lessor shall account for a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate a s an operating lease, if classifying the lease as a sales-type lease or a direct financing lease would result in the recognition of  a day-one loss. The Group adopted the standard on 1 January 2022. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, 'Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance', an update to Topic 832, 'Government Assistance'. The amendments in this update require additional annual disclosures about transactions with a g overnment that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model. The Group adopted the standard  on 1 January 2022. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group's financial statements.",

        "page_content": "In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, 'Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have und ertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients an d exceptions for applying US GAAP accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that referen ce LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of these reference rate reform initiatives. The Group adopted ASU  2020-04 on 12 March 2020, which is the issuance date of the standard. There is a choice to apply the guidance by Topic or  industry Subtopic at any time prospectively during the effective period from 12 March 2020 through 31 December 2024, with the effective period amended by ASU 2022-06 'Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848', an update to Topic 848 , 'Reference Rate Reform'. As of 31 December 2022, the Group applied the guidance to Topic 815 related to Group's adherence to the ISDA 2020 Fallbacks Protocol, which is a standardized a pproach for amending contracts in order to incorporate IBOR fallback provisions and related to changes to the critical terms of a hedging relationship due to reference rate reform as well as to Topic 944 related to changes resulting from the replacement of discontinued reference  rates included in contracts within the scope of Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'. The Group also applied the guidance to modifications of loan contracts within the scope of Topic 310 'Receivables' due to replacements of reference rates that are expected to be disconti nued. These modifications are being accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate.\n\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, 'Scope', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. Because of the broad population of derivatives affected by the market-wide transition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the 'discounting transition'), stakeholders analysed the accounting implications of the discounting transition against the available exceptions and expedients within Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform', which led them to raise questions about the scope of that Topic. The amendments clarify the scope of Topic 848 and allow entities to apply certain optional provisions in Topic 848 to derivative instruments that underg o a modification of the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment because of the discounting transition that do not also reference LIBOR or another reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. The Group  applied ASU 2021-01 as of 31 December 2022.\n\nAlthough the Group has exposure to discontinued IBORs, the transition to the new risk-free reference rates did not have a material impact, mostly due to the transition relief measures in Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'.\n\n## Future adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 'Measurement of Credit Losses', an update to Topic 326, 'Financial Instruments -  Credit Losses'. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a  methodology that reflects expected credit losses. The standard is applicable to all assets such as financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost, fi xed income securities available-for-sale, premium receivables, funds withheld assets and reinsurance recoverables. The objective of the expected credit loss model is that a reporting entity recognises its estimate of expected credit losses incorporating forward-looking information in a valuation allowance for assets in scope. The Group will adopt ASU 2016-13 on 1 January 2023 using a modified retrospective method. The impact of the adoption of the standard is expected to be a reduction in opening retained earnings of approximately USD 0.1 billion, net  of tax, primarily driven by fixed income securities available-for-sale, other loans and reinsurance recoverables.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, 'Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment', an update to Topic 350, 'Intangibles Goodwill and Other'. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity has to perform procedures to determine the fair value  of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognised assets and liabilities) at the impairment testing date following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendment s in this update, an entity should perform its regular goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying am ount. An entity should recognise an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair  value; however, the loss recognised should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. As amended by A SU 2019-10 'Effective Dates', ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. Early application of the ASU is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2017-04 is not expected to have an impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, 'Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts', an update to Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'. This ASU requires that the cash flows and net premium ratio will be updated for changes in insurance assumptions (e.g. mortality, morbidity, terminations) when measuring the liability for future policy benefits for nonparticipating traditional and limited-payment insurance and reinsurance contracts. There will no longer be a provision for adverse deviation. In addition, the disc ount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the liability for future policy benefits will be standardised. Further, the ASU requires deferred acquisition costs (DAC) relating to most long-duration contracts to be amortised on a constant basis over the expected term of the contract. As amended by ASU 2020-11 'Effective Date and Early Application', ASU 2018-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2024, and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2025. Due to the decision of the Board of  Directors of Swiss Re Ltd to prepare the Group's consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS beginning 1 January 2024, the Group does not plan to adopt ASU 2018-12.",

        "page_content": "## 2 Information on business segments\n\nThe Group provides reinsurance and insurance throughout the world through its business segments. The business segments are determined by the organisational structure and by the way in which management reviews the operating performance of the Group.\n\nThe Group presents three core operating business segments: Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions. The assignment of assets and liabilities for entities that span more than one segment is determined by considering  local statutory requirements, legal and other constraints, the economic view of duration and currency requirements of the reinsurance business written and the capacity of the segments to absorb risks. Interest expense is based on the segment's capital funding position. The tax impact of a segment is derived from the legal entity tax obligations and the segmentation of the pre-tax result. While most of the tax items can be directly attributed to individual segments, the tax within an entity which impacts two or more segments is allocated to the segments based on the applicable statutory tax rate on pre-tax income or loss with permanent tax differences specifically allocated to the applicable segments. Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance share the same year -to-date effective tax rate as both business segments belong to the Reinsurance Business Unit.\n\nAccounting policies applied by the business segments are in line with those described in the summary of significant accountin g policies (please refer to Note 1). Cross-segmental dividends and gains and losses on certain one-off transfers and transactions between segments are accounted for through segmental shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Group operating segments are outlined below.\n\n## Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance\n\nReinsurance consists of two segments, Property & Casualty and Life & Health. The Reinsurance Business Unit operates globally,  both through brokers and directly with clients, and provides a large range of solutions for risk and capital management. Cl ients include stock and mutual insurance companies as well as public sector and governmental entities. In addition to traditional reinsurance solutions, Rei nsurance offers insurance-linked securities and other insurance-related capital market products in both Property & Casualty and Life & Health.\n\nProperty & Casualty includes the business lines property, casualty (including motor) and specialty. Life & Health includes th e life and health lines of business.\n\n## Corporate Solutions\n\nCorporate Solutions offers innovative insurance capacity to mid- to large-sized corporations across the globe. Offerings range from standard risk transfer covers and multi-line programmes to highly customised solutions tailored to the needs of clients. Corporate Solutions serves customers from offices worldwide.\n\n## Group items\n\nGroup items includes iptiQ, which operates as a standalone division, with results reported within the Group items segment. Gr oup items also includes items not allocated to the business segments, which encompass Principal Investments, Swiss Re Ltd, the Group's ultimate parent company, certain Treasury units and reinsurance and insurance business in run-off. iptiQ partners with distributors providing Swiss Re access to risk pools offering white labelled protection cover in both the life and health as well as property and casualty businesses. Swiss Re Ltd charges trademark licence fees to the business segments which are reported as other revenues. Certain administra tive expenses of the corporate centre functions that are not recharged to the operating segments are reported as Group items. As of 1 January 2022, a part of Principal Investments, Admin Re US as well as certain cross-segmental loans have been reallocated from Group items to Reinsurance. Segmental comparative information for 2021 has been adjusted accordingly.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nSegment information is presented net of external and internal retrocession and other intra-group arrangements. The Group total is obtained after elimination of intra-group transactions in the 'Consolidation' column. This includes significant intra-group reinsurance arrangements, recharge of trademark licence fees and intersegmental funding.",

        "page_content": "## Prior-year development\n\nNon-life claims development on prior years in the year ended 31 December 2022 is mainly driven by increasing reserves to allow for heightened inflation across all the regions. Excluding this inflation adjustment, there is favourable development in property and specialty, partially offset by adverse development from casualty. The adverse movement in casualty is mainly from l iability and motor, partly offset by favourable development in workers' compensation. Development in property is principally due to lower-than-expected claims activity in all regions. Specialty was mainly impacted by favourable development in engineering and marine partly offset by adverse experience in aviation.\n\nFor life and health lines of business, development on prior years' unpaid claims in the year ended 31 December 2022 is unfavourable. There is unfavourable development in the US, Latin America, Australia & New Zealand, and Asia driven by adverse experience and stre ngthening of claim reserves, partially offset by favourable development in Continental Europe and the UK. C laims development related to prior years for disability portfolio also includes an element of interest accretion for unpaid claims reported at an estimated present value .\n\nA summary of prior year net claims and claim adjustment expenses development by lines of business for the years ended 31 December is shown below 1 :\n\n| USD millions      | 2021   | 2022   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Line of business: |        |        |\n| Property          | -918   | -468   |\n| Casualty          | 473    | 810    |\n| Specialty         | -255   | -13    |\n| Life and health 2 | 213    | 346    |\n| Total             | -487   | 675    |\n\n## US asbestos and environmental claims exposure\n\nThe Group's obligation for claims payments and claims settlement charges also includes obligations for long -latent injury claims arising out of policies written prior to 1986, in particular in the area of US asbestos and environmental liab ility.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the Group carried net reserves for US asbestos and environmental liabilities equal to USD 1 285 million. During 2022, the Group incurred net gains of USD 21 million and net paid losses of USD 124 million in relation to these liab ilities. These amounts include ULAE.\n\nEstimating ultimate asbestos and environmental liabilities is particularly complex for a number of reasons relating in part t o the long period between exposure and manifestation of claims, and in part to other factors, which include risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, changes in projected costs to resolve, and in the projected number of, asbestos and environmental claims, the eff ect of bankruptcy protection, insolvencies, and changes in the legal, legislative and regulatory environment. As a result, the Group believes that projection of exposures for asbestos and environmental claims is subject to far less predictability relative to non-environmental and non-asbestos exposures. Management believes that its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts and the current state of the law. However, reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as  claims develop. Additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of reserves, and the Group's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expense s may change. Any such additional liabilities or increases in estimates cannot be reasonably estimated in advance but could result in charges that could be material to operating results.",

        "page_content": "## Short duration contract unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n\n## Basis of presentation for claims development information\n\nThis section of the note provides claims development information and information on reserves for claims relating to insured events that have been incurred but not yet reported ('IBNR').\n\nClaims development information and IBNR are presented on an accident year basis and by line of business for individually sign ificant categories. Additional aggregation or disaggregation is provided where appropriate, necessary and practicable ('disaggregation categories'). For instance, Reinsurance liability and motor lines of business are further disaggregated into proportional and  non-proportional treaty types to provide more specific information on claims development. Amounts shown in the claims development tables are o n a nominal basis, including cases where the Group discounts claims liabilities for measurement under US GAAP, and are net of ext ernal retrocession and retrocession between business segments to the extent that a retrocession programme can be allocated to a disaggregation category. Ceded retroactive reinsurance is not included in the claims development table if it cannot be allocated  on a reasonable basis to the disaggregation categories used to present claims development information. Loss portfolio transfers are presented prospectively as reliable h istorical claims information is not always obtainable, or the data is incomplete and of insufficient quality.\n\nIn the Property & Casualty Reinsurance segment as well as for the non-life business in the Corporate Solutions segment, all contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are included in scope to the extent they can be allocated  to a disaggregation category. For many reinsurance contracts, proportional contracts in particular, ceding companies do not report losses by accident year. In these  cases, the Group has allocated reported losses by underwriting year to accident year to produce the accident year tables. Similarly, IBNR is calculated on an underwriting year basis and then the liabilities are allocated to accident year.\n\nLife & Health contracts that are not expected to remain in force for an extended period are classified as s hort duration contracts. These provide insurance protection for a fixed short duration and their provisions may be subject to changes at the end of contract  period, such as adjustments to the premium charged or the coverage provided. Examples of short dura tion contracts in the Life & Health Reinsurance segment include group life business, certain types of disability and long-term care contracts, group accident, and health coverage including critical illness and medical expenses. The Group provides claims development information for Life & Health Reinsurance where reported accident year information is available and there is potential for claims development. This primarily applies to the group dis ability business in Australia, Continental Europe and the UK. This business is generally considered to have relatively higher claims estimation uncertainty than other life and health lines such as group life, due to longer claims development periods.\n\nThe Group provides no claims development information for the Group items segment as its short duration reserves are not material. This is also the case for Life & Health business in the Corporate Solutions segment, where short duration contracts mainly include me dical expenses coverage business.\n\nFor Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions, the Group discloses data for ten acci dent years and reporting periods.\n\nThe Corporate Solutions business segment was created in 2012. Corporate Solutions related business written in Property & Casualty Reinsurance prior to 2012 is included in the net claims development information reported by this segment. All but an immateri al portion of claims arising from accident years prior to 2012 relate to accident years which are over ten years ago and therefore out of the required range of disclosure.\n\nThe current reporting period estimate of net claims liabilities for accident years older than the number of years shown in th e claims development tables is presented as a total after disclosure of cumulative paid claims.\n\nThe information presented in claims development tables is presented at current balance sheet foreign exchange rates as of the  date of these financial statements to permit an analysis of claims development excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements.\n\nSome of the information provided in the following tables is Required Supplementary Information (RSI) under US GAAP and does n ot form part of these consolidated audited financial statements. Claims development information for all periods except the current reporting period and any information derived from it - including average annual percentage payout of claims incurred - is considered RSI and is identified as RSI in the tables presented.",

For reinsurance business, case reserves and estimated IBNR are reported by cedents and this IBNR is presented togeth er with the Group's own estimate as IBNR in the claims development tables. For insurance business, reserving is performed similarly, except that estimates for case reserves and IBNR are performed by the Group.\n\nReserving is done on portfolio or contract level depending on the feature s of the contract. For business reviewed on a portfolio level, the expected ultimate losses are set for most lines and types of business based on analysis performed using standard actuarial te chniques. In general, contracts are aggregated into portfolios by combining contracts with similar features, and ultimate losses are derived using a blend of initial costing loss ratio and actual reported experience, with more weighting given to experience over time.\n\nThe initial reserving estimate uses a loss ratio projection method, where the projected loss ratio is generally the costing loss ratio, reflecting the underwriter's view of the risk. In the case of new information regarding loss trends, rate changes or a different underwr iter's estimate, the projected loss ratio can be adjusted if approved by the Regional Reserving Committee.  As experience develops, the most common standard reserving methods used are successively the Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Benktander and Chain Ladder methods. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method assumes that the future claims experience is in line with the one anticipated by the costing loss ratio, used as an a priori loss ratio, and not based on claims experience. The Benktander method is a weighted average of the Bornhuetter -Ferguson and Chain Ladder methods, where the weighted average is linked to the reported development pattern. In other terms, this method mainly follows the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in the early stages and the Chain Ladder later on, progressively giving more weight to the e xperience. The Chain Ladder method assumes past trends will be repeated and extrapolates the current position to ultimate using historical d evelopment trends.\n\nIn most cases, these standard actuarial techniques encompass a number of loss development factor techniques applied to claim tables of paid and reported losses. Other actuarial techniques may be applicable to specific categories, such as an analysis of frequen cy and severity. Life contingency techniques for projecting regular payments related to bodily injury claims are applied to motor proportional, motor nonproportional, liability proportional, liability non-proportional, accident and health, where the information is available. In some cases, techniques specific to the projection of future payments for specific risks such as asbestos or pollution claims are applied to both proportional and non-proportional liability claims, also in Corporate Solutions (see also separate section 'US asbestos and environmental claims exposure' on page 231). Reserving for non-traditional business is carried out on a deal-by-deal basis according to each deal's specifications.  For large events, a separate process takes into consideration the relevant expertise from underwriting and c laims functions in estimating the ultimate loss.\n\nContract-level reserving is based on standard actuarial techniques but requires more detailed contract, pricing, claim and exposure information than required for the business reviewed on a portfolio level.\n\n## Life and health re/insurance contracts\n\nFor the Life & Health business, liability for unpaid claims includes case reserves, IBNR, and provisions for disability income  claims-inpayment. Estimates for case reserves allow for expected rates of decline for the not yet settled claims. IBNR claim rese rves are calculated using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson approaches, and assumptions as to the claims reporting patterns, initial expected ultimate claims, and weighting given to historical experience. Liability for disability income claims-in-payment is determined by calculating expected future claim payments using the assumed rate of termination of claims due to death or recovery.\n\n## Claims frequency information\n\nClaims frequency information is not available for the disaggregation categories of Property & Casualty Reinsurance, as cedents do not report claims frequency information to the Group for most of the assumed reinsurance contract types.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance reports claims frequency information based on individual incidence. The number of reported claims is the actual number of claims booked. For disability business, claims with multiple payments in a year are counted as one claim. Claims th at are reported but not recognised are included in the claim count. Claims frequency information is not available for the group disability business in Continental Europe as reliable historical claims frequency information is not obtainable.\n\nFor Corporate Solutions, claims frequency is displayed for direct business only, as individual claims information is generally not available for assumed and ceded business. Claims are counted individually per contract to produce the claims frequency table. For some dire ct business, summary reports are received, and multiple claims are booked under a single claim code; this is usually done at a programme, policy year, state, country and/or line of business level of detail. This approach may be applied to business which has a high volume of c laim counts, but with only minor claims dollars associated with each claim.",

Claims development in non-proportional motor business is considered long-tailed as it is dominated by liability exposures leading to bodily injury claims which pay out for the lifetime of the claimant. The increases in the incurred losses across accident years in reporting year 2022 are driven by inflation increases where appropriate.",

For details on consolidation please refer to Note 2 ''Information on business segments''.\n\nThe net outstanding liabilities correspond to the total liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of r einsurance for each disaggregation category.\n\nOther short duration contract lines include reserves for business that is not material to the Group and where accident year information is not available. For Life & Health Reinsurance, in certain markets, cedents do not provide sufficient information to reinsurers to split claims incurred and claims paid by accident year. This is based on existing market practice. For these markets, an assessment of available information from other sources was made along with investigating approximations that could be used to provide claims development information b y accident year. However, these alternate sources and estimates, based on currently available data and methods, could not be used to generate meaningful and representative accident year information and therefore have been excluded from disclosure. Other short duratio n contract lines also contain other treaties from Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions which could not be allocated o n a consistent basis to disaggregation categories or specific accident years.\n\nAs of 31 December\n\n| USD millions                                                                                     | 2022   |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Net outstanding liabilities                                                                      |        |\n| Property & Casualty Reinsurance                                                                  |        |\n| Property                                                                                         | 11 804 |\n| Liability, proportional                                                                          | 13 389 |\n| Liability, non-proportional                                                                      | 8 853  |\n| Accident & Health                                                                                | 5 066  |\n| Motor, proportional                                                                              | 3 726  |\n| Motor, non-proportional                                                                          | 5 976  |\n| Specialty                                                                                        | 6 701  |\n| Corporate Solutions                                                                              | 7 346  |\n| Life & Health Reinsurance, long tail                                                             | 2 765  |\n| Total net undiscounted outstanding liabilities excluding other short duration contract lines and |        |\n| before unallocated reinsurance recoverable                                                       | 65 626 |\n| Discounting impact on (Life & Health Reinsurance) short duration contracts                       | -266   |\n| Impact of acquisition accounting                                                                 | -340   |\n| Total net discounted outstanding liabilities excluding other short duration contract lines and   |        |\n| before unallocated reinsurance recoverable                                                       | 65 020 |\n| Other short duration contract lines                                                              | 3 456  |\n| Total net discounted outstanding short duration liabilities                                      | 68 476 |\n| Allocated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid claims:                                             |        |\n| Property & Casualty Reinsurance                                                                  |        |\n| Property                                                                                         | 931    |\n| Liability, proportional                                                                          | 241    |\n| Liability, non-proportional                                                                      | 194    |\n| Accident & Health                                                                                | 203    |\n| Motor, proportional                                                                              | 54     |\n| Motor, non-proportional                                                                          | 183    |\n| Specialty                                                                                        | 99     |\n| Corporate Solutions                                                                              | 4 928  |\n| Consolidation                                                                                    | -3 930 |\n| Impact of acquisition accounting                                                                 | -56    |\n| Other short duration contract lines                                                              | 554    |\n| Total short duration reinsurance recoverable on outstanding liabilities                          | 3 401  |\n| Exclusions:                                                                                      |        |\n| Unallocated claim adjustment expenses                                                            | 1 216  |\n| Long duration contracts                                                                          | 12 325 |\n| Total other reconciling items                                                                    | 13 541 |\n| Total unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses                                                | 85 418 |",

        "page_content": "## Impairment on fixed income securities related to credit losses\n\nOther-than-temporary impairments for debt securities are bifurcated between credit and non-credit components, with the credit component recognised through earnings and the non-credit component recognised in other comprehensive income. The credit component of other-than-temporary impairments is defined as the difference between a security's amortised cost basis and the present value of expecte d cash flows. Methodologies for measuring the credit component of impairment are aligned to market observer forecast s of credit performance drivers. Management believes that these forecasts are representative of median market expectations.\n\nFor securitised products, cash flow projection analysis is conducted by integrating forward -looking evaluation of collateral performance drivers, including default rates, prepayment rates and loss severities and deal-level features, such as credit enhancement and prioritisation among tranches for payments of principal and interest. Analytics are differentiated by asset class, product t ype and security-level differences in historical and expected performance. For corporate bonds and hybrid debt instruments, an expected loss approach based on d efault probabilities and loss severities expected in the current and forecasted economic environment is used for securities identified as credit-impaired to project probability-weighted cash flows. Expected cash flows resulting from these analyses are discounted, and the present value is compared to the amortised cost basis to determine the credit c omponent of other-than-temporary impairments.\n\nA reconciliation of other-than-temporary impairments related to credit losses recognised in earnings was as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                                                                                                                                                                                         |   2021 |   2022 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of 1 January                                                                                                                                                                                              |     46 |     44 |\n| Credit losses for which an other-than-temporary impairment was not previously recognised                                                                                                                             |      5 |     54 |\n| Reductions for securities sold during the period                                                                                                                                                                     |    -10 |    -46 |\n| Increase of credit losses for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognised previously, when the  Group does not intend to sell, or more likely than not will not be required to sell before recovery |      5 |     10 |\n| Impact of increase in cash flows expected to be collected                                                                                                                                                            |     -1 |     -1 |\n| Impact of foreign exchange movements                                                                                                                                                                                 |     -1 |     -1 |\n| Balance as of 31 December                                                                                                                                                                                            |     44 |     60 |",

The fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for  each financial instrument received or pledged by the Group. Management believes that master netting agreements provide for legally enforceab le set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure. Upon occurrence of an event of def ault, the non-defaulting party may set off the obligation against collateral received regardless if it has been offset on the balance sheet prior to the defaulting event. The net amounts of the financial assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet were recognised in 'Other invested assets', 'Investments for unit-linked business' and 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities'.",

This three-level hierarchy is based on the observability of the inputs used in the fair value measurem ent. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has the abi lity to access. Level 1 inputs are the most persuasive evidence of fair value and are to be used whenever possible. The types of instruments include most US government and sovereign obligations, active listed equities, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments and most money market securities.\n\nLevel 2 inputs are market-based inputs that are directly or indirectly observable, but not considered level 1 quoted prices. Level 2 inputs consist of (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non- active markets (eg markets which have few transactions and where prices are not current or price quotations vary substantially); (ii i) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable (eg interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks and default rates); (iv) inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and (v) quoted prices provided by third party brokers. The t ypes of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage- and asset-backed products, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments, catastrophe bonds, less liquid listed equities and state, municipal and provincial obligations.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. These inputs reflect the Group's own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Certain financial instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments include private equity, less liquid corpora te debt securities and certain asset-backed securities (ABS). Certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. When appropriate, valuat ions are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nPursuant to the election of the fair value option, the Group classifies certain liabilities for life and health policy benefits in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credi t considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nThe fair values of assets are adjusted to incorporate the counterparty risk of non-performance. Similarly, the fair values of liabilities reflect the risk of non-performance of the Group, captured by the Group's credit spread. These valuation adjustments from assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs are recognised in net realised gains and losses. For  2022, these adjustments were not material. Whenever the underlying assets or liabilities are reported in a specific business segment, the valuation a djustment is allocated accordingly. Valuation adjustments not attributable to any business segment are reported in Group items.\n\nIn certain situations, the Group uses inputs to measure the fair value of asset or liability positions that fall into differe nt levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Group will determine the appropriate level based on the lowest level input that is significant to the determination of the fair value.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nUS government securities typically have quoted market prices in active markets and are categorised as lev el 1 instruments in the fair value hierarchy. Non-US government holdings are generally classified as level 2 instruments and are valued on the basis of the quotes provided by pricing services, which are subject to the Group's pricing validation reviews and pricing vendor challenge process. Valuations provided by pricing vendors are generally based on the actual trade information as substantially all of the Group's non-US government holdings are traded in a transparent and liquid market.\n\nCorporate debt securities mainly include US and European investment-grade positions, which are priced on the basis of quotes provided by third party pricing vendors and first utilise valuation inputs from actively traded securities, such as bid prices, bid spreads to Treasury securities, Treasury curves and same or comparable issuer curves and spreads. Issuer spreads are determined from actual quotes and traded prices and incorporate considerations of credit/default, sector composition, and liquidity and call features. Where market data is not available, valuations are developed based on the modelling techniques that utilise observable inputs and option-adjusted spreads and incorporate considerations of the security's seniority, maturity and the issuer's corporate structure.\n\nValues of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are obtained both from third party pricing vendors and through quoted prices, some of which may be based on the prices of comparable securities with similar structural and collateral features. Values of certain ABS for which there are no significant observable inputs are developed using benchmarks to similar transactions or indices. For both residential mortgagebacked securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), cash flows are derived based on the transaction-specific",

        "page_content": "information, which incorporates priority in the capital structure, and are generally adjusted to reflect benchmark yields, market prepayment data, collateral performance (default rates and loss severity) for specific vintage and geography, credit enhancements and ratings. For certain RMBS and CMBS with low levels of market liquidity, judgements may be required to determine comparable securities based on the loan type and deal-specific performance. CMBS terms may also incorporate lock-out periods that restrict borrowers from prepaying the loans or provide disincentives to prepay and therefore reduce prepayment risk of these securities, compared to RMBS. The fac tors specifically considered in valuation of CMBS include borrower-specific statistics in a specific region, such as debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, as well as the type of commercial property. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities also includes debt securitised by credit card, student loan and auto loan receivables. Pricing inputs for these securities also focus on capturing, where relevant, collateral quality and performance, payment patterns and delinquencies.\n\nThe Group uses third party pricing vendor data to value agency securitised products, which mainly include collateralised mortgage obligations (CMO) and mortgage-backed government agency securities. The valuations generally utilise observable inputs consistent with those noted above for RMBS and CMBS.\n\nEquity securities held by the Group for proprietary investment purposes are mainly classified in level 1. Securities classified in level 1 are traded on public stock exchanges for which quoted prices are readily available.\n\nThe category 'Other invested assets' includes the Group's private equity and hedge fund investments which are made directly or via ownership of funds. Valuation of direct private equity investments requires significant management judgement due to the absence of quoted market prices and the lack of liquidity. Initial valuation is based on the acquisition cost, and is further refined based on the available market information for the public companies that are considered comparable to the Group's holdings in the private companies being valued, and the private company-specific performance indicators, both historic and projected. Subsequent valuations also reflect business or asset appraisals, as well as market transaction data for private an d public benchmark companies and the actual companies being valued, such as financing rounds and mergers and acquisitions activity. The Group's holdings in private equity and hedge funds are generally valued utilising net asset values (NAV), subject to adjustments, as deemed necessary, for restrictions on redemption (lock -up periods and amount limitations on redemptions). These investments are included under investments measured at net asset value as a practical expedient.\n\nThe Group holds both exchange-traded and OTC interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and equity derivative contracts for hedging a nd trading purposes. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives measured using observable exchange prices are classified in level 1. Long-dated contracts may require adjustments to the exchange-traded prices which would trigger reclassification to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives are generally valued by the Group based on the internal models, which are consistent with industry  standards and practices, and use both observable (dealer, broker or market consensus prices, spot and forward rates, interest rate and credit curves and volatility indices) and unobservable inputs (adjustments for liquidity, inputs derived from the observable data based on the Group's judgements and assumptions).\n\nThe Group's OTC interest rate derivatives primarily include interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and floors and are valued based on the cash flow discounting models which generally utilise as inputs observable market yield curves and volatility assumptions.\n\nThe Group's OTC foreign exchange derivatives primarily include forward, spot and option contracts and are generally valued based on the cash flow discounting models, utilising as main inputs observable foreign exchange forward curves.\n\nThe Group's investments in equity derivatives primarily include OTC equity option contracts on single or baskets of market indices and equity options on individual or baskets of equity securities, which are valued using internally developed models (such as the Black -Scholes type option pricing model and various simulation models) calibrated with the inputs, which include underlying spot prices, dividend curves, volatility surfaces, yield curves and correlations between underlying assets.\n\nThe Group's OTC credit derivatives can include index and single-name credit default swaps. Plain vanilla credit derivatives, such as index and single-name credit default swaps, are valued by the Group based on the models consistent with the industry valuation standards for t hese credit contracts, and primarily utilise observable inputs published by market data sources, such as credit spreads and recovery rates. These valuation techniques warrant classification of plain vanilla OTC derivatives as level 2 financial instruments in the fair val ue hierarchy.",

A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement corporate debt securities is credit spread. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value m easurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement credit tenant leases is illiquidity premium. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) f air value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's OTC equity option referencing correlated  equity indices is correlation. Where the Group is long correlation risk, a significant increase (decrease) in this input  in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group is short correlation risk, a significant increase (decre ase) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's weather contracts are risk margin, corr elation, volatility and index value. Where the Group has a long position, a significant increase (decrease) in th e risk margin input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would ha ve resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short position, a significant increase (decrease) in the risk margin input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a  short volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's variable annuity and fair valued guaran teed minimum death benefit (GMDB) contracts are: risk margin, volatility, lapse, mortality improvement rate and withdrawal rate. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in each of the following inputs: risk margin, volatility and withdrawal rate would have resulted in a  significantly lower (higher) fair value of the Group's obligation. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in lapse rate would, in general, have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value of the Group's obligation due to the maturity of the contracts. Changes in the mortality improvement rate impact the fair value of the Group's obligation differently for living -benefit products, compared to death-benefit products. For the former, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality improvement rate (ie decrease (increase) in  mortality) in isolation would have resulted in a decrease (increase) in fair value of the Group's liability. For the latter, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortalit y improvement rate in isolation would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in fair value of the Group's liability.\n\n## Other invested assets measured at net asset value\n\nOther invested assets measured at net asset value as of 31 December were as follows:\n\n| USD millions          | 2021  Fair value   | 2022  Fair value   | Unfunded  commitments   | Redemption frequency  (if currently eligible)   | Redemption  notice period   |\n|-----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Private equity funds  | 1 302              | 1 489              | 607                     | non-redeemable                                  | n/a                         |\n| Real estate funds     | 2                  | 1                  | 15                      | non-redeemable                                  | n/a                         |\n| Private equity direct | 165                | 249                | 90                      | non-redeemable                                  | n/a                         |\n| Hedge funds           | 1                  | 1                  |                         | redeemable 1                                    | 90 days 2                   |\n| Total                 | 1 470              | 1 740              | 712                     |                                                 |                             |\n\nPrivate equity and real estate funds generally have limitations imposed on the amount of redemptions from the fund during the  redemption period due to illiquidity of the underlying investments. Fees may apply for redemptions or transferring of interest to other parties. Distributions are expected to be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated . The period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated is indeterminate as investees provide liquidation notices.\n\nThe private equity direct portfolio consists of equity and equity-like investments directly in other companies. These investments have no contractual term and are generally held based on financial or strategic intent.\n\nThe hedge fund investments employ a variety of strategies, including relative value and event-driven across various asset classes.\n\nThe redemption frequency of hedge funds varies depending on the manager as well as the nature of the underlying product. Additionally, certain funds may impose lock-up periods and redemption gates as defined in the terms of the individual investment agreement.",

Some of these positions need to be assessed in conjunction with the corresponding insurance business, whilst the fair value of some other positions does not differ materially from the carrying amount. Considering these circumstances  for these positions, the Group presents the carrying amount as an approximation for the fair value. For certain commercial mortgage loans and infrastructure loans, which are included in mortgage loans and other loans respectively, the fair value can be estimated using discounted cash flow models which are b ased on discount curves and spread inputs that require management's judgement.\n\nInvestments in real estate are fair valued primarily by external appraisers based on proprietary discounted cash flow models  that incorporate applicable risk premium adjustments to discount yields and projected market rental income streams based  on market-specific data. These fair value measurements are classified in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDebt positions, which are fair valued based on executable broker quotes or the discounted cash flow method using  observable inputs, are classified as level 2 measurements. Fair value of the majority of the Group's level 3 debt positions is  judged to approximate carrying value due to the highly tailored nature of the obligation and short-notice termination provisions.",

        "page_content": "## 9 Derivative financial instruments\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, options, forwards, credit derivatives and excha nge-traded financial futures in its trading and hedging strategies, in line with the Group's overall risk management strategy. The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purchases, existi ng assets or liabilities, as well as locking in attractive investment conditions for future available funds.\n\nThe fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for each class of derivative contract held o r issued by the Group. The gross fair values are not an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA master agreements or their equivalent. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure.",

For more details on the hedging, please refer to Note 9 'Derivative financial instruments'.\n\n## Convertible debt\n\nIn June 2018, SRL issued six-year senior unsecured exchangeable notes with issuer stock settlement. The notes have a face value of USD 500 million, with a fixed coupon of 3.25% per annum, payable semi -annually in arrear until the maturity date (13 June 2024). Subject to the conditions of the notes, noteholders may exchange their notes for ordinary shares of SRL at an exchange price of USD 102.2844 (adjusted from the initial exchange price of USD 115.2593). The exchange price is subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances described in the conditions of the notes. The issuer may elect to settle a noteholder-initiated exchange in cash or SRL shares. To economically offset the settlement of a noteholder-initiated exchange, SRL purchased matching call options on SRL shares with a portion of the proceeds. Consequently, no new SRL shares will be issued upon a noteholder-initiated exchange. Assuming that all of the notes are exchanged at the request of noteholders, and subject to further adjustments to the exchange price as described in the conditions of the notes, 4 888 331 registered shares of SRL would have to be delivered to noteholders. Both the noteholder -initiated exchange option and the matching call options are accounted as equity within these financial statements.\n\n## Long-term debt issued in 2022\n\nIn May 2022, Swiss Re Ltd issued subordinated fixed-to-floating rate non step-up callable loan notes with an aggregate face value of USD 700 million by fully drawing on the subordinated debt facility established in November 2015.

This translates into an effective tax rate in the current and prior-year reporting periods of 26.3% and 21.5%, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the rate was driven by profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions, tax charges from non -deductible expenses, increases on valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and increases in unrecognised tax benefit liabilities, partially offset by tax benefits from foreign currency translation differences and prior year adjustments. The tax rate in the year ended 31 December 2021 was largely driven by profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions and tax charges from non -deductible expenses, partially offset by tax benefits from the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and foreign currency translation differences between statutory and  US GAAP accounts.",

The Group ha s the intent and ability to control all distributions from foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner. Deferred tax liabilities or additional foreign withholding tax liabilities will be recognised if the Group can no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistri buted earnings. As of 31 December 2022, the US GAAP undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries was USD 5.6 billion. Due to the differences in US GAAP and local tax basis of undistributed earnings, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liability if these earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.\n\nIn 2022, USD 2 million was distributed from subsidiaries where the earnings were planned to be permanently reinvested. No for eign tax withholding liability arose from this distribution and minimal shareholder tax liability resulted due to the participation tax exemption rules.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group had USD 14 761 million net operating tax loss carryforwards, expiring as follows: USD 6 mil lion in 2023, USD 796 million in 2024, USD 378 million in 2025, USD 736 million in 2026, USD 7 877 million in 2027 and beyond and USD 4 968 million never expire.\n\nAs of 31 December 2022, the Group had capital loss carryforwards of USD 551 million, expiring as follows: USD 12 million in 2 025, USD 2 million in 2027 and beyond and USD 537 million that neve r expire.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, net operating tax losses of USD 3 142 million and net capital tax losses of USD 95 milli on were utilised.",

        "page_content": "The valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2021 and 2022 was USD 388 million and  USD 361 million, respectively. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended 31 December 2022 was a decrease of USD 27 million, with a USD 17  million decrease driven by balance sheet translation recorded in equity, a USD 21 million net increase included as a tax charge in income tax from operations and a USD 31 million decrease from entities disposed in 2022 and inc luded in the net assets sold.\n\nThe valuation allowance as of 31 December 2022 was primarily related to loss carryforwards and intangible assets that, in the judgment of management, are not more likely than not to be realised. In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, management co nsiders whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of deferred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.\n\nManagement considers projections of future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on the level of historical taxable income and projections of future taxable income over the periods for which the deferred tax assets are ded uctible, management believes that is more likely than not that the Group will realise the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowance as of 31 December 2022. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be red uced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.\n\nSubsequently recognised tax benefits related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2022 will b e allocated entirely to income tax from operations.\n\nIncome taxes paid in 2021 and 2022 were USD 258 million and USD 419 million, respectively.\n\n## Unrecognised tax benefits\n\nA reconciliation of the opening and closing amount of gross unrecognised tax benefits (excluding interest and penalties) is a s follows:\n\n| USD millions                                             |   2021 | 2022   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of 1 January                                  |    150 | 143    |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to current year |     11 | 14     |\n| Additions based on tax positions related to prior years  |     14 | 14     |\n| Reductions for tax positions of current year             |     -2 | -2     |\n| Reductions for tax positions of prior years              |    -20 | -5     |\n| Statute expiration                                       |     -2 |        |\n| Settlements                                              |     -1 | -7     |\n| Other (including foreign currency translation)           |     -7 | -5     |\n| Balance as of 31 December                                |    143 | 152    |\n\nAs of 31 December 2021 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognised tax benefits within the tabular reconciliation that, if recognised, would affect the effective tax rate were approximately USD 143 million and USD 152 million, respectively.\n\nInterest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense/benefit. For the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2022, such expenses were USD 1 million and USD 4 million respectively, offset with a USD 5 million payment in 2022. For the years ended 31 December 2021 and 2022, USD 38 million and USD 37 million, respectively, were accrued for the payment of interest (net of tax benefits) and penalties. The accrued interest balance as of 31 December 2022 is included within the deferred and other non-current taxes section reflected above and in the balance sheet.\n\nThe balance of gross unrecognised tax benefits as of 31 December 2022 presented in the table above excludes accrued interest and penalties (USD 37 million).\n\nDuring the year, certain tax positions and audits in Canada, Malaysia, Singapore and Switzerland were effectively settled.\n\nThe Group continually evaluates proposed adjustments by taxing authorities. The Group believes that it is reaso nably possible (more than remote and less than likely) that the balance of unrecognised tax benefits could decrease by USD  108 million over the next 12 months due to settlements or expiration of statutes. It is also reasonably possible that balance could increase as a result of proposed adj ustments by taxing authorities. Quantification of an estimated range of increases cannot be made at this time.",

Tactical allocation decisions that reflect this strategy are made on a quarterly basis, including balancing the investment portfolios between equity and fixed income securities.",

Real estate reported on level 3 is property owned by the pension funds. These positions are accounted for at the  capitalised income value. The capitalisation based on sustainable recoverable earnings is conducted at interest rates that are determined individually for each property, based on the property's location, age and condition. If properties are intended for  disposal, the estimated selling costs and taxes are recognised in provisions. Sales gains or losses are allocated to income from real estate when the contract is concluded.\n\nThe fair value of the insurance contract is based on the fair value of the assets backing the contract.\n\nAs of 31 December, the fair values of pension plan assets were as follows:\n\n|                            | Fair value                                                        | Fair value

For LPP 2019, LPP 2020, LSP 2021 and LSP 2022 awards, an addit ional two-year holding period applies for all members of the Group EC and other key executives. At grant date, LPP 2019 awards were split eq ually into two underlying components of Performance Share Units (PSUs). The ROE PSUs are measured against a return o n equity performance condition and will vest within a range of 0-100%. The TSR PSUs are based on relative total shareholder return, measured against a pre -defined group of peers and will vest within a range of 0-200%. At grant date, LPP 2020 was split equally into three underlying components of PSUs. The ENW PSUs, being the third component, are measured against ENW growth performance and will vest within a range of 0 -100%. As of 2021, the LSP succeeded the LPP, whereby depending on the corporate band of the  participant, the plan consists of either non-performance based components in the form of Share Units (SUs), three separate performance-based components in the form of PSUs, similar to LPP 2020, each vesting within a range of 0-150%, or a mix of both non-performance and performance based components. Each SU is entitled to a dividend equivalent (equal value to actual Swiss Re dividends), accrued annually and settled in shares at the end of the ve sting period. The fair values of all components are determined separately, based on stochastic models.\n\nThe fair value assumptions in the grant valuations include market estimates for dividends for all LPP and LSP awards, and the  risk-free rate based on the average of the 10-year US Treasury bond taken monthly over each year in the performance period for LPP 2019, LSP 2020 and LSP 2021. Risk-free rates range between 1.5% and 2.2%.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2022, the outstanding units were as follows:\n\n| ROE PSU                       | LPP 2019   | LPP 2020   | LSP 2021   | LSP 2022   |\n|-------------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|\n| Non-vested at 1 January       | 286 158    | 200 391    | 118 032    |            |\n| Granted                       |            |            |            | 127 489    |\n| Forfeited                     | -4 987     | -4 638     | -2 049     | -1 344     |\n| Vested                        | -281 171   | -423       | -1 455     | -1 790     |\n| Outstanding as of 31 December | 0          | 195 330    | 114 528    | 124 355    |\n| Grant date fair value in CHF  | 78.22      | 78.81      | 74.20      | 69.44      |\n\nTSR PSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n275 596\n\n328 153\n\n213 007\n\nGranted\n\n317 526\n\nForfeited\n\n-4 802\n\n-7 595\n\n-3 698\n\n-3 345\n\nVested\n\n-270 794\n\n-693\n\n-2 625\n\n-4 460\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n0\n\n319 865\n\n206 684\n\n309 721\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n81.25\n\n48.12\n\n53.67\n\n67.57\n\nENW PSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n185 545\n\n114 611\n\nGranted\n\n141 283\n\nForfeited\n\n-4 293\n\n-1 991\n\n-1 490\n\nVested\n\n-392\n\n-1 413\n\n-1 984\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n180 860\n\n111 207\n\n137 809\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n85.17\n\n74.20\n\n69.44\n\nSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n307 779\n\nGranted\n\n20 456\n\n407 596\n\nForfeited\n\n-12 423\n\n-11 162\n\nVested\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n315 812\n\n396 434\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n93.50\n\n87.90",

        "page_content": "## 21 Variable interest entities\n\nThe Group enters into arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. The involvement ranges from being a passive investor to designing, structuring and managing the VIEs. The variable interests held by the Group arise primarily as a result of the Group's involvement in certain insurance-linked securitisations, life and health funding transactions, swaps in trusts, debt financing, investment, senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans as well as other entities, which meet the definition of a VIE.\n\nWhen analysing whether the entity is a VIE, the Group mainly assesses if (1) the equity is sufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) the equity holders have the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations and (3) the holders of the voting rights substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.\n\nWhen one of these criteria is not met, the entity is considered a VIE and is assessed for consolidation under the VIE section of the Consolidation Topic.\n\nThe party that has a controlling financial interest is called a primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The party is de emed to have a controlling financial interest if it has both:\n\n- the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and\n- the obligation to absorb the entity's losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nFor all its variable interests in VIEs, the Group assesses whether it has a controlling financial interest in these entities  and, thus, is the primary beneficiary. The Group identifies the activities that most significantly impact the entity's performance and determines whether the Group has the power to direct those activities. In conducting the analysis, the Group considers the purpose, the design and the risks t hat the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. Additionally, the Group assesses if it has the obligati on to absorb losses or if it has the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. If both criteria are met, the Group has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and consolidates the entity.\n\nThe Group monitors changes to the facts and circumstances of the existing involvement with legal entities to determine whether they require reconsideration of the entity's designation as a VIE or voting interest entity. For VIEs, the Group regularly reassesses the primary beneficiary determination.\n\n## Insurance-linked securitisations\n\nThe insurance-linked securitisations transfer pre-existing insurance risk to investors through the issuance of insurance-linked securities. In insurance-linked securitisations, the securitisation vehicle assumes the insurance risk from a sponsor through insurance or derivative contracts. The securitisation vehicle generally retains the issuance proceeds as collateral, which consists of investment-grade securities. The Group does not have potentially significant variable interest in these vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary.\n\nTypically, the variable interests held by the Group arise through ownership of insurance-linked securities, in which case the Group's maximum loss equals the principal amount of the securities held by the Group.\n\n## Life and health funding vehicles\n\nThe Group participates in certain structured transactions that retrocede longevity and mortality risks to captive reinsurers with an aim to provide regulatory capital credit to a transaction sponsor through the creation of funding notes by a separate funding vehicle which is generally considered a VIE. The Group's participation in these transactions is generally limited to providing contingent fund ing support via a financial contract with a funding vehicle, which represents a potentially significant variable interest in the funding vehicle. The Group does not have power to direct activities of the funding vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary of the funding vehicle s in these transactions. The Group's maximum exposure in these transactions equals either the total contract notional or outstanding balance of the funding notes issued by the vehicle, depending on the specific contractual arrangements.\n\n## Swaps in trusts\n\nThe Group provides interest rate and foreign exchange risk hedges to certain asset securitisation trusts which qualify as VIEs. As the Group's involvement is limited to interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, it does not have the  power to direct any activities of the trusts and therefore does not qualify as primary beneficiary of any of these trusts. These activities are in run-off.\n\n## Investment vehicles\n\nThe Group's variable interests in investment partnerships arise through ownership of the limited partner interests. Many investment partnerships are VIEs because the limited partners as a group lack kick-out or participating rights. The Group does not hold the general partner interest in the limited partnerships and therefore does not direct investment activities of the entity. Therefore, the Group lacks power over the relevant activities of the vehicles and, consequently, does not qualify as the primary beneficiary. The Group is exposed to losses when the values of the investments held by the investment vehicles decrease. The Group's maximum exposure to loss equals the Group's share of the investment.",

        "page_content": "The Group is a passive investor in structured securitisation vehicles issuing residential and commercial mortgage -backed securities (RMBS and CMBS, respectively) and other asset-backed securities (ABS). The Group's investments in RMBS, CMBS and other ABS are passive in nature and do not obligate the Group to provide any financial or other support to the issuer entities. By design, RMBS, CMBS and ABS securitisation entities are not adequately capitalised and therefore considered VIEs. The Group is not the primary beneficiary, because it does not have power to direct most significant activities. These investments are accounted for as available-for-sale as described in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\nThe Group consolidates an investment vehicle, because the Group holds the entire interest in the entity and makes investment decisions related to the entity. The investment vehicle is a VIE because it is structured as an umbrella company comprised of multi ple sub-funds. The majority of the investments held in this vehicle are accounted for as available-for-sale and are disclosed in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\n## Investment vehicles for unit-linked business\n\nAdditionally, the Group invests on behalf of the policyholders as a passive investor in a variety of investment funds across various jurisdictions. By design, many of these funds meet a VIE definition. While the Group may have a potentially significant varia ble interest in some of these entities due to its share of the fund's total net assets, in most cases it does not have power over the fund's  investment decisions or unilateral kick-out rights relative to the decision maker.\n\nThe Group is not exposed to losses in the aforementioned investment vehicles, as the investment risk is borne by the policyholder.\n\n## Senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans\n\nThe Group also invests in structured commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans, which are held for investme nt.\n\nThe commercial mortgage loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with commercial real estate. The entities are adequately capitalised and generally structured as voting interest entities. Occasionally, the borrower entities can be structured as limited partnerships where the limited partners do not have kick-out or participating rights, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe infrastructure loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with infrastructure project assets. Some borrower entities may have insufficient equity investment at risk, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe Group does not have power over the activities most significant to the aforementioned borrower entities designated as VIEs and therefore does not consolidate them.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss from its investments equals the loan outstanding amount.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Group did not provide financial or other support to any VIEs during 2022 that it was not previously contra ctually required to provide.",

This balance is comprised of debt securities issued by governments and government agencies, corporations, and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. This amount is included in the fixed income securities line item on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe determination of the fair value of these investments is based on assumptions, including credit and valuation spreads. The determination of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as the assumptions are based on internal estimates. The valuation of fixed income securities has been designated as a key audit matter given changes in the estimate could have a material impact on consolidated balance sheet. Auditing this balance involved an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialized skills and knowledge, due to the estimate uncertainty associated with the assumptions.\n\n## Our response\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of fixed income securities.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the data used in the fair value estimation by reconciling to source information.\n\nWe involved our valuation specialists with specialized skills and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Assessing the pricing methodologies with reference to relevant accounting standards, and industry practice.\n- -Developing an independent estimate for a selection of securities, and comparison of the independent estimate to the Group's fair value estimate.\n\n## For further information on the Valuation of Fixed Income Securities refer to the following:\n\n- -Note 1\n- -Note 7\n- -Note 8\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## VALUATION OF LIFE AND HEALTH RESERVES\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\nThe Group has recorded life and health reserves of $42,903 million as of 31 December 2022. Life, and health reserves are included in the life and health related unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, liabilities for life and health policy benefits, and policyholder account balances line items on the consolidated balance sheet (collectively, life and health reserves).\n\nThe determination or revision of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as these assumptions are generally not based on observable market inputs. These assumptions include mortality, morbidity, withdrawals, persistency (lapse), benefit termination rates and lag factors. Additional uncertainties related to the mortality assumption have arisen due to the ongoing Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe valuation of life and health reserves has been designated as a key audit matter given the material nature of the balance and the significant estimation uncertainty and complexity of the mortality, morbidity,\n\n## Our response\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of life and health reserves. Further, we tested the design and implementation of certain key controls within the process, including the independent actuarial peer review and reserving committee level reviews.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the underlying policyholder contract data by reconciling to source information.\n\nWe involved our actuarial specialists with specialized skills, and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Evaluating the methods applied to select the mortality, morbidity, persistency (lapse), benefit termination rates and lag factor assumptions by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial techniques;\n\n2",

Property and casualty reserves is included in the property and casualty related unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses line item on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe determination of assumptions used to develop the estimate requires subjectivity and judgment as these assumptions are generally not based on observable market inputs. Among the most significant assumptions are the initial estimates of loss ratios, which are used to estimate liabilities in the most recent accident years. Other assumptions include but are not limited to changes in exposure, inflation trends, claims emergence trends, and other legal or regulatory decisions. Additional uncertainties related to these assumptions have arisen due to the on-going Coronavirus pandemic. This includes legal interpretations of event aggregation clauses as well as terms and conditions, risks related to claims reporting, and social inflation.\n\nProperty and casualty reserves associated with longtail lines of business, such as Liability, Asbestos and Environmental and Motor, generally require more subjectivity, and judgment due to the length of the claim reporting period resulting in increased volatility of claims frequency, and severity trends.\n\nThe valuation of property and casualty reserves has been designated as a key audit matter given the material nature of the balance and the significant estimation uncertainty and complexity of the actuarial assumptions. Auditing the estimate involved a high degree of auditor judgment and increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialists with specialized skills and knowledge.\n\n## Our response:\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of property and casualty reserves. Further, we tested the design, and implementation of certain key controls within the process, including the independent peer review and committee level reviews.\n\nWe tested the completeness, and accuracy of the underlying data by reconciling to source information, and validating the appropriateness of claims triangles.\n\nWe involved our actuarial specialists with specialized skills, and knowledge, as applicable, who assisted the audit team in:\n\n- -Evaluating the methods applied to select the actuarial assumptions by comparing them to generally accepted actuarial techniques;\n- -Evaluating the Group's estimates by performing independent calculations of property and casualty reserves for certain lines of business;\n- -For certain lines of business where we performed independent calculations, developing a range of reserve estimates, and assessing the position of the Group's recorded reserve relative to the range;\n- -Assessing the Group's internally prepared actuarial analyses in comparison to internal experience, and related industry trends for certain lines of business.",

The determination of assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as the assumptions are based on internal estimates.\n\nThe valuation of deferred tax assets has been designated as a key audit matter given changes in the estimate could have a material impact on net income (through income tax expense). Auditing the estimate involved an increased extent of audit effort, including the involvement of specialized skills and knowledge, due to the estimation uncertainty associated with the assumptions.\n\n## Our response:\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the valuation of deferred tax assets.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Swiss Law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error, and the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they",

We also:\n\n- -  Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control. Accordingly, no such opinion is expressed.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.\n- -  Conclude whether, in our judgment, there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the Group's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the entity's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the entity to cease to continue as a going concern.\n- -  Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.\n- -  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities withing the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit of the Group. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.\n\nWe are required to communicate with the Board of Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit, significant audit findings, and certain internal control related matters, including any significant deficiencies, that we identified during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs at year-end exchange rates, with the exception of participations, which are reported in Swiss francs at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, short-term deposits and certain investments in money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less. Such current assets are held at nominal value.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments contain investments with an original maturity between three months and one year. Such investments are carried at cost, less necessary and legally permissible depreciation.\n\n## Receivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other receivables\n\nThese assets are generally carried at nominal value. Value adjustments are recorded where the expected recovery value is lower than the nominal value.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other receivables also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\n## Accrued income\n\nAccrued income consists of both other expenditures incurred during the financial year but relating to a subsequent financial year, and revenues relating to the current financial year but receivable in a subsequent financial year.\n\n## Loans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nLoans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies are carried at nominal value.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nThese assets are carried at cost less necessary value adjustments to reflect other than temporary decreases in the value in use.\n\nIn 2021, the Group streamlined its legal entity structure. The direct subsidiaries Swiss Re Corporate Solutions Ltd and Swiss Re Life Capital Ltd transferred the rights and obligations of all assets and liabilities to the direct subsidiary Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd in the form of a merger with an accounting effective date of 1 January 2021. As a result, the Company increased the carrying amount of the investment in Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd by the carrying amounts of the investments in Swiss Re Corporate Solutions Ltd and Swiss Re Life Capital Ltd. The merger had no impact on the Company's total assets, total liabilities or total shareholders' equity. Further details are provided in Note 6 'Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies'.\n\n## Payables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other liabilities\n\nThese liabilities are generally carried at nominal value.\n\nPayables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other liabilities also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.",

        "page_content": "## Accrued expenses\n\nAccrued expenses consist of both income received before the balance sheet date but relating to a subsequent financial year, and charges relating to the current financial year but payable in a subsequent financial year.\n\n## Loans from subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nLoans from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are carried at nominal value.\n\n## Provisions\n\nProvisions contain provision for currency fluctuation and provision for taxation.\n\nThe provision for currency fluctuation comprises the net effect of foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the revaluation of the balance sheet at year-end. These net impacts are recognised in the income statement over a period of up to three years. Where the provision for currency fluctuation is insufficient to absorb net foreign exchange losses for the financial year, the provision for currency fluctuation is reduced to zero and the excess foreign exchange loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe provision for taxation represents an estimate of taxes payable in respect of the reporting year.\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt is held at redemption value.\n\n## Other legal capital reserves\n\nOther legal capital reserves reflect gains and losses from sale of own shares (directly held by the Company).\n\n## Reserve for own shares (indirectly held by subsidiaries)\n\nReserve for own shares is accounted for at the book value of those shares in the statutory financial statements of the respective subsidiary.\n\n## Own shares (directly held by the Company)\n\nOwn shares are carried at cost and presented as a deduction in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign exchange transactions are recognised in the income statement and reported in other revenues or other expenses, respectively.\n\n## Dividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised as investment income in the year in which they are declared.\n\n## Trademark licence fees\n\nTrademark licence fees are charged by the Company to its direct and indirect subsidiaries and their branches that benefit from the use of the Swiss Re brand.\n\n## Capital and indirect taxes\n\nCapital and indirect taxes related to the financial year are included in other expenses. Value-added taxes are included in the respective expense lines in the income statement.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nSwiss Re Ltd is subject to ordinary income taxation at cantonal/ communal and federal level.\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are indirectly exempt from income taxation (participation relief).\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 15 March 2023. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the 'Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements' section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law, together with the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARES AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\n\n## Key Audit Matter\n\n## Our response\n\nThe Company has recorded investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies of CHF 18,555 million and a valuation adjustment on these investments of CHF 286 million as of 31 December 2022. Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised at acquisition cost or, in the case of expected permanent impairment, at the lower fair value. The investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are not listed on an active market. The company determines the fair value of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies, representing the difference between the fair value of assets and liabilities, using the internal established valuation method.\n\nThe recoverability of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies is supported by an impairment assessment by comparing the book value against the Company's determined fair value. Depending on the amount of the headroom between the book value and\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the impairment assessment of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We performed a risk assessment to determine the amount of the headroom which would give us the scope of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies with a higher risk on recoverability. For these investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies we performed the following audit procedures:\n\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the appropriateness of the valuation method used against recognised accounting methods and Swiss Law.\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the client's fair value by using an alternative valuation method.\n- \uf8e7 Assessing the accuracy of the valuation allowance by comparing the valuation allowance calculated and the booked amount.",

We have nothing to report in this regard.\n\n## Board of Directors' Responsibilities for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nIn preparing the financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.\n\n## Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements\n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and SA-CH will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.",

The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- -  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.\n- -  Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made.\n- -  Conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.\n\nWe communicate with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.\n\nWe also provide the Board of Directors or its relevant committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, actions taken to eliminate threats or safeguards applied.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Board of Directors or its relevant committee, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report, unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.\n\n## Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements\n\nIn accordance with article 728a para. 1 item 3 CO and PS-CH 890, we confirm that an internal control system exists, which has been designed for the preparation of financial statements according to the instructions of the Board of Directors.\n\nWe further confirm that the proposed appropriation of available earnings complies with Swiss law and the Company's articles of incorporation.

        "page_content": "## Note on risk factors\n\nThe operations, investments and other activities of Swiss Re Ltd ('SRL') and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Swiss Re') are subject to a range of risks that could adversely impact the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## General impact of adverse market conditions\n\nSwiss Re's operations as well as its investment returns are subject to conditions in the financial markets and macroeconomic factors. Financial, credit and foreign exchange markets are experiencing continued periods of volatility reflecting a range of political, geopolitical, economic and other uncertainties, some of the more significant of which are inter-related, including high inflation.\n\nFor example, higher replacement costs may lead to higher replacement costs than anticipated following a claim. In Property & Casualty Reinsurance, due to inflation and supply chain issues, costs to rebuild and repair structures have significantly increased and, as a result, there is a risk that Swiss Re's reserves may not be adequate to address such claims in the future.\n\nFurther adverse developments or the continuation of adverse trends that, in turn, have a negative impact on financial markets and economic conditions, could limit the Group's ability to access the capital markets and bank funding markets, could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to meet their obligations to the Group and could adversely affect the confidence of the ultimate buyers of insurance and reinsurance.\n\nAny of the foregoing factors, developments and trends could have a material adverse effect on the Group's investment and overall results, make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in the Group's portfolio, make it more difficult to acquire suitable investments to meet its risk and return criteria and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## Impact of the military conflict in Ukraine and other geopolitical developments\n\nThe ongoing military conflict in Ukraine, sanctions, and other potential impacts on the global economic environment and currencies may cause demand for the Group's products to be volatile (particularly in Europe), cause abrupt changes in the Group's customers' buying patterns, result in higher than usual insurance claims (including in relation to aviation insurance claims), interrupt the Group's ability to supply products to this region or to fulfil contractual obligations or limit customers' access to financial resources, which may impact such customers' ability to satisfy obligations to the Group. In the event geopolitical tensions fail to abate or deteriorate further, additional sanctions may be enacted, which may adversely impact the global economy and supply chain, banking and monetary systems, markets or customers for Swiss Re's products. This could adversely affect Swiss Re's results or operations.\n\n## Sustainability and environmental, social and governance ('ESG') activities and disclosures\n\nSwiss Re's investors, shareholders, business partners, customers and other third parties, including regulators and public authorities, are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance ('ESG'), sustainability and corporate social responsibility ('CSR') endeavours and reporting. Swiss Re's statutory ESG reporting requirements will be due for the first time in 2024 with respect to the 2023 financial year. In addition, Swiss Re has a Group Sustainability Strategy and a set of policies addressing ESG, sustainability, and CSR and is a founding member of the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance and the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (together, the 'Alliances'). As a founding member of the Alliances, Swiss Re demonstrated its commitment to transition its investment and underwriting portfolios to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and Swiss Re played an instrumental role in the development of the methodology for insurance associated emissions and the development of the target setting protocols, which in turn will be used by members of the Alliances as a basis to set independently sustainability targets.",

If Swiss Re does not adapt to or comply with the evolving investor, shareholder, business partner or third party, including regulators and public authorities, expectations and CSR, ESG and/or sustainability recommendations, standards, norms, metrics or regulatory requirements and/or does not meet its CSR, ESG and/or sustainability targets, goals and/or ambitions, Swiss Re can be perceived to have not responded appropriately to CSR, ESG and/or sustainability recommendations, standards, norms, metrics or regulatory requirements. Furthermore, Swiss Re may suffer from reputational damage and/or litigation or regulatory proceedings, which could result in its financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected. In addition, changes and uncertainty in relation to policies or regulations regarding sustainability, ESG or CSR matters as well as the fragmentation of ESG legislation globally, may result in potential litigation, higher regulatory and compliance costs and increased capital expenditures, which could result in Swiss Re's financial condition being materially and adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, Swiss Re's investors, shareholders, business partners and third parties look to ESG rating systems, or disclosure frameworks that have been developed by third party groups to allow comparisons between companies on ESG factors as they evaluate investment decisions as well as company disclosures. Swiss Re does not participate in all of the available rating systems, and would not necessarily score well in all of the available ratings systems. Further, the criteria used in these ratings systems change frequently, and Swiss Re cannot guarantee that it will be able to score well as criteria change. Failure to participate in certain third party ratings systems, failure to score well in those ratings systems or failure to provide certain ESG disclosures could result in reputational damage, which could result in Swiss Re's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Risk of unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage, including social inflation\n\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to risk of claims and coverage developing in an adversely different manner than originally anticipated may continue to emerge. Such issues have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Group's business by either requiring it to extend coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims against the Group. For example, the trend of social inflation has increased liability claims against the Group in recent years. There has been an increase in severity of awards and settlements affecting excess and umbrella layers, particular in the US, as well as an increase in commercial automotive and general liability claims. The Group has continued to pro-actively strengthen its reserves and has considered the latest information and outlook related to such claims, including in relation to economic and social inflation when making its reserve decisions. In addition, the Group closely monitors the intersection between social inflation, economic inflation and loss trend and intends to adjust its pricing accordingly. The Group intends to continue to manage its exposure to large corporate risks in line with its cautious view on social inflation. Despite the Group's various measures to address these issues, there remains uncertainty on how these unintended issues related to claims and coverage may impact the Group's business. If the Group's reserving and pricing is not adequate to cover these issues, there could be an additional adverse effect for the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations.",

The reorganisation, which aims to simplify structures, improve efficiency and client experience, will be effective 3 April 2023, subject to regulatory approval. The current Reinsurance Business Unit will be split into Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance, with each having full authority over the respective underwriting and claims management processes. Urs Baertschi, currently Chief Executive Officer Reinsurance EMEA, will lead Property & Casualty Reinsurance, while Paul Murray, currently CEO Reinsurance Asia Pacific, will lead Life & Health Reinsurance. Moses Ojeisekhoba, currently CEO Reinsurance, will take over leadership of Global Clients and Solutions. This Business Unit will contain the client management teams servicing Swiss Re's global reinsurance clients, Public Sector Solutions, iptiQ and Reinsurance Solutions. Corporate Solutions continues as a Business Unit under the leadership of Andreas Berger.\n\nThe reorganisation may present financial, managerial and operational risks, including an interruption of, or loss of momentum in the activities of one or more of Swiss Re's Business Units. In addition, it is not guaranteed that the reorganisation will simplify Swiss Re's structures, improve efficiency and client experience and the reorganisation process may prove to be more complex, time consuming and require substantially more resources than originally anticipated. Any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the reorganisation, could result in Swiss Re's financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected.\n\n## Insurance, operational and other risks\n\nAs part of the Group's ordinary course operations, the Group is subject to a variety of risks, including risks that reserves may not adequately cover future claims and benefits; risks that catastrophic events (including natural catastrophes, such as hurricanes, cyclones, tornadoes, windstorms, hail storms, wildfires, floods and earthquakes, as well as extreme space weather events such as solar storms and geomagnetic activity, and man-made disasters, such as acts of terrorism, cyberattacks and other disasters such as explosions, industrial accidents and fires, as well as diseases, pandemics, epidemics and humanitarian crises) are inherently unpredictable in terms of both their frequency and severity and have exposed, and may continue to expose, the Group to unexpected large losses (and related uncertainties in estimating future claims in respect of such events, such as Hurricane Ian, which made landfall in Florida in September 2022); changes in the insurance industry that affect ceding companies, particularly those that further increase their sensitivity to counterparty risk; competitive conditions (including as a result of consolidation and the availability of significant levels of alternative capacity); cyclicality of the industry; risks related to emerging claims and coverage issues (including, in particular, social inflation); macro developments giving rise to emerging risks, such as climate change and technological developments (including greater exposure to cyber risks, where accumulation risk is yet to be fully understood, which could have a range of consequences from operational disruption, to loss of proprietary or customer data, to greater regulatory burdens and potential liability); risks arising from the Group's dependence on policies, procedures and expertise of ceding companies; risks related to investments in emerging markets; and risks related to the failure of, or attacks directed at, the Group's operational systems and infrastructure, including its information technology networks and systems. Any of the foregoing, as well as the occurrence of future risks that the Group's risk management procedures fail to identify or anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on the Group, and could also give rise to reputational risk.",

        "page_content": "## Financial and capital market risk\n\nVolatility and disruption in the global financial markets could expose the Group to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely impact the Group's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital position. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk is primarily related to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. In general, a higher interest rate environment is beneficial to the insurance and reinsurance industries, supporting earnings capacity via higher investment income. Additionally, an increase in interest rates results in an increase in the Group's Swiss Solvency Test ratio, while reducing US GAAP shareholders' equity. Exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. When credit spreads widen, the net unrealised loss position of the Group's investment portfolio can increase, as could other-than-temporary impairments.\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices, as well as the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular equity security, a basket of equity securities or a stock index. The Group is also subject to equity price risk to the extent that the values of life-related benefits under certain products and life contracts, most notably variable annuity contracts, are wholly or partially exposed, directly and/or indirectly, to market fluctuations, including equity prices. To the extent market values fall, the financial exposure on guarantees related to these contracts would increase to the extent this exposure is not hedged. While the Group has an extensive hedging programme covering its existing variable annuity business, certain risks cannot be hedged, including actuarial, basis and correlation risks. Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises from changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.\n\nThe Group seeks to manage the risks inherent in its investment portfolio by repositioning the portfolio from time to time, as needed, and to reduce risk and fluctuations through the use of hedges and other risk management tools. These risks can have a significant effect on investment returns and market values of securities positions, which in turn may affect both the Group's results of operations and financial condition. The Group continues to focus on asset-liability management for its investment portfolio, but pursuing even this strategy has its risks, including a possible mismatch between investments and liability benchmarks, that in turn can lead to reinvestment risk.",

        "page_content": "## Legal, regulatory and tax risks\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Group is involved in lawsuits, arbitrations and other formal and informal dispute resolution procedures, the outcomes of which determine the Group's rights and obligations under insurance, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. From time to time, the Group may institute, or be named as a defendant in, legal proceedings, and the Group may be a claimant or respondent in arbitration proceedings. These proceedings could involve coverage or other disputes with ceding companies, disputes with parties to which the Group transfers risk under reinsurance arrangements, disputes with other counterparties or other matters. The Group cannot predict the outcome of any of the foregoing, which could be material for the Group.\n\nIn the future, the Group could be involved in investigations and regulatory proceedings, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines and other outcomes. These investigations and proceedings could relate to insurance or reinsurance matters, or could involve broader business conduct rules, including those in respect of market abuse, bribery, money laundering, sanctions, competition law, data protection and privacy or ESG, CSR and/or sustainability issues. The Group also is subject to audits and challenges from time to time by tax authorities, which could result in increases in tax costs, changes to internal structures and interest and penalties. Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws. The Group could be subject to risks arising from alleged, or actual, violations of any of the foregoing, and could also be subject to litigation or enforcement actions arising from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with internal policies and procedures, negligence and malfeasance, such as undertaking or facilitating cyber-attacks on internal systems. Substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause significant reputational harm, which could seriously affect its business.\n\n## Changes in the legal, regulatory or tax environment\n\nSwiss Re and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment, which continues to change over time. The regulatory regimes to which members of the Group are subject have changed significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to evolve. While some regulation is national in scope, the global nature of the Group's business means that its operations are subject in effect to a patchwork of global, national and regional standards. Swiss Re and its subsidiaries are subject to group supervision and Swiss Re's subsidiaries are also subject to applicable regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, particularly Switzerland, the United States, Luxembourg and Singapore. Swiss Re, as well as its Swiss-regulated entities, is subject to the Swiss Solvency Test and, through its legal entities and branches organised in the European Economic Area ('EEA'), Solvency II.\n\nWhile certain regulatory processes are designed in part to foster convergence and achieve recognition of group supervisory schemes, the Group continues to face risks of extraterritorial application of regulations, particularly as to group supervision and group solvency requirements. In addition, regulators in jurisdictions beyond those where the Group has core operations increasingly are playing a far greater oversight role, requiring more localised resources and, despite a predominantly local focus, also raise issues of a cross border nature. Furthermore, evolving regulatory schemes and requirements may be inconsistent or may conflict with each other, thereby subjecting the Group, particularly in light of the increasing focus on legal entities in isolation, to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs.",

        "page_content": "On the international level, certain large insurance companies were designated as global systemically important insurers ('G-SIIs') and reinsurance companies faced potential designation as G-SIIs. While the Financial Stability Board ('FSB') in consultation with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ('IAIS') decided to discontinue the annual identification of G-SIIs, the IAIS will assess systemic risks through the holistic framework for systemic risk that entered into force in the beginning of 2020. The framework embraces an enhanced set of policy measures targeted at the exposures and activities that can lead to systemic risks from the insurance sector. The Group cannot predict what additional regulatory changes will be implemented as the IAIS systemic risk process evolves and what any such changes may mean for how the Group is structured in any particular jurisdiction and how aspects of its business may be affected.\n\nCurrent discussions on domestic systemically important insurers ('D-SIIs') are ongoing in certain jurisdictions.\n\nLarge internationally active insurance groups ('IAIGs'), which is a designation compiled by the IAIS as identified by group-wide supervisors, may become subject to a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard ('ICS'). ICS Version 2.0 was adopted in November 2019, and is expected to take effect in 2025, following a five-year confidential reporting period during which no supervisory action will be taken on the basis of the monitoring. In November 2019, the IAIS also adopted the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ('ComFrame'), as well as some changes to a number of Insurance Core Principles ('ICPs') - principles and standards on supervision of insurers which apply to insurance companies regardless of size and international exposures. ComFrame strengthens ICP requirements for IAIGs and, inter alia , proposes that the group-wide supervisor, in consultation with the host supervisors, should exercise discretion in requiring IAIGs to submit recovery plans. Swiss Re has been classified as an IAIG.\n\nThe Group can neither predict which legislative and/or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or promulgated, nor their scope and content, their date of enactment or their implications for the industry, in general, and for the Group, in particular. The Group may be subject to changes in views of its supervisors in respect of the models that the Group uses for capital and solvency purposes, and could be adversely affected if, for example, it is required to use standard models rather than internal models. Generally, legal and regulatory changes could have a material impact on the Group's business. Notwithstanding the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU single market and customs union, continued uncertainty regarding the ways in which the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will evolve could also impact the legislative and/or regulatory regimes to which the Group is subject (including Solvency II), both in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.\n\nRegulatory changes also could occur in areas of broader application, such as competition policy and tax laws. For example, changes in tax laws, or the interpretation of the tax laws or tax regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group does business, or withdrawals of tax rulings in jurisdictions such as Switzerland that have issued such rulings to Swiss Re, could increase the taxes the Group pays, or impact the attractiveness of products offered by the Group, the Group's investment activities or the value of deferred tax assets. These changes, or inconsistencies between the various regimes that apply to the Group, could increase the costs of doing business (including due to increased capital requirements), reduce access to liquidity, limit the scope of current or future business or affect the competitive balance, or could make reinsurance less attractive to primary insurers.",

        "page_content": "## Risks relating to credit rating downgrades\n\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of (re)insurance companies. Third party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of (re) insurers, such as Swiss Re. These ratings are intended to measure a company's ability to repay its obligations and are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies. Ratings may be solicited or unsolicited.\n\nThe Group's solicited ratings reflect the current opinion of the rating agencies with whom we maintain an interactive rating relationship for the purpose of solicited ratings. One or more of the Group's ratings could be downgraded or withdrawn in the future, or the Group may decide to give up such rating voluntarily. In addition, unsolicited ratings may also be downgraded or withdrawn, such as the downgrade in April 2020 of unsolicited insurer financial strength and long-term issuer default ratings assigned to various entities within the Group. Rating agencies may, in their sole discretion, increase the frequency and scope of ratings reviews, revise their criteria or take other actions that may negatively impact the Group's ratings and/or the ratings of its legal entities, which it cannot predict. In addition, changes to the process or methodology of issuing ratings, changes in regulation, or the occurrence of events or developments affecting the Group, could adversely affect the Group's existing ratings or make it more difficult for the Group to achieve improved ratings which it would otherwise have expected. In particular, it is possible that the Group's ratings could be negatively affected by a range of current challenges faced by the Group and the industry, such as the challenging market environment, the level of natural catastrophe losses, underwriting performance, changes in senior management, economic trends and financial market performance on the Group. Any of the foregoing, or a combination of the foregoing, could have a negative impact on the Group's business.\n\nAs financial strength ratings are a key factor in establishing the competitive position of (re)insurers, a decline in ratings of Swiss Re and/or the ratings of its key rated legal entities could make (re)insurance provided by the Group less attractive to clients relative to (re)insurance from competitors with similar or stronger ratings. A decline in ratings could also cause the loss of clients who are required by either policy or regulation to purchase (re)insurance only from (re)insurers with certain ratings, or whose confidence in the Group is otherwise diminished. Certain larger (re)insurance and derivative contracts may contain terms that would allow the ceding companies or counterparties to terminate the contract if the Group's ratings or those of its subsidiaries are downgraded beyond a certain threshold. Furthermore, ratings directly impact the availability and terms of unsecured financing (potentially impacting both the Group's ability to rollover existing facilities and/or obtain new facilities) and declines in the Group's ratings or the ratings of legal entities within the Group could also obligate the Group to provide collateral or other guarantees in the course of its business or trigger early termination of funding and/or derivative arrangements. As a ratings decline could also have a material adverse impact on the Group's costs of borrowing or ability to access the capital markets, the adverse implications of a downgrade could be more severe.\n\n## Coronavirus\n\nThe global spread of the coronavirus and the disease it causes ('COVID-19'), and the actions taken to slow the spread of the pandemic, have had an adverse impact on communities, social and business interactions, economic activity and economies across the globe. The global economy remains exposed to developments around the coronavirus. New developments, such as new strains of the virus which risk becoming vaccine-resistant, consequences brought by long-COVID 19, or recurring spreads of COVID-19, like the spread of COVID-19 that has taken place in China following the easing of strict lockdown measures in December 2022, could pose threats to the global economy. Nevertheless, the global insurance markets (as measured by premium growth) were less severely impacted by COVID-19 in 2022 than expected, attributed to digitalization, and increased consumers' risk awareness and so on. However, the global insurance industry remains exposed to adverse claims with regards to additional health care costs and higher mortality.",

In Australia, a test case found largely in favour of insurance companies. Legal actions on a number of pandemic-related claims continue in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nMany pandemic-related developments continue to interact with long-term trends on the insurance industry. It also remains to be seen how public-private partnership initiatives may evolve to address future pandemics.\n\n## Use of models; accounting matters\n\nThe Group is subject to risks relating to the preparation of estimates and assumptions that its management uses, for example, as part of its risk models as well as those that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the Group's financial statements (such as assumptions related to the Group's capital requirements and anticipated liabilities), including assumed and ceded business. For example, the Group estimates premiums pending receipt of actual data from ceding companies, which actual data could deviate from the estimates (and could be adversely affected if premiums turn out to be lower, while claims stay the same). In addition, particularly with respect to catastrophic events, it may be difficult to estimate losses, and preliminary estimates may be subject to a high degree of uncertainty and change as new information becomes available. Deterioration in market conditions could have an adverse impact on assumptions used for financial reporting purposes, which could affect possible impairment of present value of future profits, fair value of assets and liabilities, deferred acquisition costs or goodwill. Moreover, regulators could require the use of standard models instead of permitting the use of internal models. To the extent that management's estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on underwriting results (in the case of risk models) or on reported financial condition or results of operations (in the case of accounting judgments), and such impact could be material.\n\nThe Group's results may be impacted by changes in accounting standards, or changes in the interpretation of accounting standards. Changes in accounting standards could impact future reported results or require restatement of past reported results. The Group's results may also be impacted if regulatory authorities take issue with any conclusions the Group may reach in respect of accounting matters.\n\nThe Group uses non-GAAP financial measures in its external financial reporting. These measures are not prepared in accordance with US GAAP or any other comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be viewed as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP. Moreover, these may be different from, or otherwise inconsistent with, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. These measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited.\n\nThe Group includes in its annual report a separate section in respect of its results, including financial statements, prepared in accordance with the Group's proprietary economic value management ('EVM') principles ('EVM section'). Financial information included in the EVM section contains non-GAAP financial measures. The EVM principles differ significantly from US GAAP and, accordingly, the Group's results prepared in accordance with US GAAP will differ from its EVM results, and those differences could be material. The Group's annual EVM results can be more volatile than the US GAAP results because, among others, assets and liabilities are measured on a market consistent basis, profit recognition on new contracts is recognised at inception rather than over the lifetime of the contract, and life and health actuarial assumptions are on a best estimate basis as opposed to generally being locked-in. The Group's EVM financial statements should not be viewed as a substitute for the Group's US GAAP financial statements.",

        "page_content": "## Credit risk\n\nIf the credit markets were to deteriorate, the Group could experience losses. Changes in the market value of the underlying securities and other factors impacting their price could give rise to market value losses. The Group could also face write-downs in other areas of its portfolio, including other structured instruments, and the Group and its counterparties could face difficulties in valuing credit-related instruments. Differences in opinion with respect to valuations of credit-related instruments could result in legal disputes among the Group and its counterparties as to their respective obligations, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict and could be material. The Group is also subject to credit and other risks in its credit business, including reliance on banks that underwrite and monitor facilities in which the Group participates and potential default by borrowers under those facilities.\n\n## Liquidity risks\n\nThe Group's business requires, and its clients expect, that it has sufficient capital and sufficient liquidity to meet its (re)insurance obligations, and that this would continue to be the case following the occurrence of any foreseeable event or series of events, including extreme catastrophes, that would trigger insurance or reinsurance coverage obligations. The Group's uses of funds include, among other things, payment of its obligations arising in its insurance and reinsurance businesses (including claims and other payments as well as insurance provision repayments due to portfolio transfers, securitisations and commutations), which may include large and unpredictable claims (including catastrophe claims), funding of capital requirements and operating costs, payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and funding of acquisitions. The Group also has unfunded capital commitments in its private equity and hedge fund investments, which could result in funding obligations at a time when it is subject to liquidity constraints. In addition, the Group has potential collateral requirements in connection with a number of reinsurance arrangements, the amounts of which may be material and the meeting of which could require the Group to liquidate cash equivalents or other securities.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity and funding risks by focusing on the liquidity stress that is likely to result from extreme capital markets scenarios or from extreme loss events or combinations of the two. Generally, the ability to meet liquidity needs could be adversely impacted by factors that the Group cannot control, such as market dislocations or interruptions, adverse economic conditions, severe disruption in the financial and worldwide credit markets and the related increased constraints on the availability of credit; changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads; or by perceptions among market participants of the extent of the Group's liquidity needs.\n\nUnexpected liquidity needs (including to meet collateral calls) could require the Group to increase levels of indebtedness or to liquidate investments or other assets. Should the Group require liquidity at a time when access to bank funding and the capital markets is limited, it may be unable to secure new sources of funding. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through asset sales may be constrained by market conditions and the related stress on valuations. In addition, the Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through the incurrence of debt may be limited by constraints on the general availability of credit in the case of bank funding, and adverse market conditions, in the case of capital markets debt. Failure to meet covenants in lending arrangements could further constrain access to liquidity. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs may also be constrained by regulatory requirements that require regulated entities to maintain or increase regulatory capital, or that restrict intragroup transactions, the timing of dividend payments from subsidiaries or the fact that certain assets may be encumbered or are otherwise not tradeable. Finally, any adverse ratings action against the Group could trigger a need for further liquidity (for example, by triggering termination provisions or margin calls/collateral delivery requirements in contracts to which Swiss Re is a party) at a time when the Group's ability to obtain liquidity from external sources is limited by such ratings action.
