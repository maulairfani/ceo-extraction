        "page_content": "## The global economy and financial markets\n\n## Year in review\n\nThe world economy made a strong cyclical recovery from the COVID-19 crisis in 2021. Vaccination rollouts, economic reopening and policy stimulus -particularly in advanced markets -generated surging demand. However, fresh waves of the virus and renewed restrictions in several countries later in the year reinforced the uneven nature of the worldwide recovery. For example, German GDP growth contracted again in the fourth quarter.\n\n## Global economy\n\nThe world economy expanded by 5.6% in 2021 after a pandemic-induced contraction of 3.5% in 2020. The US economy (5.7%) bounced back stronger than the Euro area (5.2%). China, the only major economy to escape economic contraction in 2020 (+2.3%), expanded by 8.1% in 2021. Other emerging markets also recovered, with India estimated to have grown by 9.2% and Brazil by 4.7%.\n\nInflation surged in many countries in 2021, excluding China. Price pressures were fueled by supply-demand imbalances, rising energy prices and the statistical 'bounce back' from the low base in price levels in 2020.\n\nThe protracted supply-side issues also weighed on global economic growth in the second half of 2021. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices skyrocketed to all-time highs in Europe and Brent crude oil rose to a three-year high of $86 per barrel. Cost pressures also began to shift into slower moving but harder to reverse price categories, such as rents and wages.\n\n## Interest rates\n\nCentral banks began to rein in ultraaccommodative monetary policy in 2021, albeit moderately, amid rising inflation and recovering labour markets. The US Federal Reserve (Fed) started tapering its asset purchase programme from November 2021, and several other central banks in advanced and emerging markets began to raise interest rates in 2021, notably the Bank of England (BoE). In contrast, the European Central Bank (ECB) maintained its ultra-accommodative monetary policy stance and even temporarily ramped up asset purchases for a part of 2021.\n\nLong-term government bond yields ended 2021 higher than a year earlier in response to the global economic recovery and rising inflation expectations (see Table on next page). However, German and Swiss long-term bond yields were still in negative territory throughout the year. Chinese yields were the key exception and moved lower in 2021, with the 10-year yield closing lower by almost 0.4 percentage points at 2.8%.",

The US S&P 500 index gained 27%, Europe's STOXX 600 index gained 22%, and Switzerland's SMI index gained 20% (see stock markets chart). All three of these stock indices also reached new record levels in 2021, as did some other stock indices like Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40. The economic rebound, strongly recovering corporate earnings and a supportive monetary and fiscal policy environment fueled the strong rally.\n\nThe performance of emerging market stock markets was more mixed in 2021. The MSCI EM stock index closed the year down -4.6%. The key underperformer was China, with the Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 Index down -5.2% over the year due to various headwinds from regulatory tightening, property sector deleveraging, and the 'zero COVID-19' strategy.\n\n## Currency movements\n\nOther than some weakening in the second quarter, the US dollar appreciated against most currencies throughout 2021 amid expectations of a more hawkish Fed following higher than expected inflation. The US dollar ended the year 7.4% higher against the euro, which was also reinforced by the relatively more dovish ECB, interest rate differential and a slower European economic recovery, as the region faced renewed COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns at the beginning and end of last year, unlike the US. The US dollar appreciated to a lesser extent against the Swiss franc and British pound (by +3.1% and +1.0%, respectively).\n\n## Stock markets 2016-2021\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Refinitiv, Swiss Re Institute",

        "page_content": "## Outlook\n\n## Year ahead economic outlook\n\nAfter a strong bounce back in economic activity last year, real GDP growth rates are set to slow significantly this year. Inflation rates are expected to stay very elevated in 2022 amid high energy prices, protracted supply-side constraints and broadening price pressures. Over the longer term, inflation is expected to be structurally higher post-COVID-19, particularly in the US, while Swiss Re sees comparatively lower inflation risks in the euro area and China.\n\nPolicy conditions are tightening, with a notable fiscal drag expected especially this year in the US. On monetary policy, Swiss Re expects the Fed to complete tapering asset purchases in March and to hike several times in 2022, joining other central banks in raising interest rates. Swiss Re also expects quantitative tightening (QT) to occur earlier and faster in 2022. The ECB is also planning to exit its ultra-accommodative policy, but will do so more gradually.\n\nSwiss Re expects long-term government bond yields to increase in 2022. That said, the long-term structural drivers of low interest rates are likely here to stay. These include high debt levels, demographics, and other structural characteristics such as economic inequality.\n\n## Long-term outlook: the three 'Ds'\n\nThe world has seen a cyclical recovery, however structural problems remain. Swiss Re believes more inclusive and sustainable growth is needed and has identified three key trends that will affect the resilience of the economy's longer-term path. These are the three 'Ds' (divergence, digitalisation, decarbonisation) 1 .\n\nDivergence: The growing divergence within and across countries in economic recovery, economic inequality and socioeconomic opportunity is a key concern. These divergences make the overall global recovery uneven and fragile. For example, countries with lower vaccination rates were more exposed to virus resurgences in 2021. Looking ahead, Swiss Re expects stronger emphasis on inclusive growth as well as taxation and regulation as policymakers seek to confront divergences in societies and economies.\n\n## Digitalisation: Inclusive digital\n\ntransformation is needed to 'future proof' the economy. Digitalisation is a promising path to higher productivity growth, which has declined since the global financial crisis. Higher productivity growth would raise living standards and increase the natural rates of interest. This would allow\n\npolicymakers more room for monetary manoeuvre and strengthen the resilience of economies.\n\nDecarbonisation: The influence of climate change is on the rise. This will increasingly set economies back through physical risks, such as property damage, disruption to trade and lost productivity. Swiss Re estimates that the world stands to lose around 11% of GDP under a scenario of 2\u00b0C warming by 2050. 2 Achieving the Paris Agreement target would reduce the economic losses and be the best possible outcome (see chart below on estimated mitigated GDP loss). Rapid decarbonisation is therefore imperative. However, the ongoing energy crisis illustrates the complexity of managing this green transition. This reinforces the need for an even greater acceleration in alternative green and renewable energy supplies. Insurers can support this transition as providers of risk transfer capability and knowledge, as well as through long-term investments in green infrastructure. This would also unlock new opportunities and jobs in the real economy.\n\n## Mitigated GDP loss by mid-century if Paris Agreement target is met, versus 2\u00b0C rise\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Swiss Re Institute, 2021\n\nNote: The figure is based on simulations of the severe economic impacts from climate change.

Non-life insurance ranges from personal lines business such as health, motor and household to standardised commercial liability and property lines. It also includes sophisticated tailor-made covers like specialty and industrial risk insurance.\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global non-life premiums expanded by around 3% in real terms in 2021, after a small increase of 1.5% in 2020, the first year of the pandemic. As inflation in 2021 was notably higher than in 2020, the real numbers understate the significant change seen in nominal growth terms. Swiss Re estimates that in nominal terms, non-life premiums were up about 7% in 2021, after a 3% gain in 2020. The strong nominal outcome in 2021 came in spite of the headwinds from the lingering effects of the pandemic.\n\nThe return to long-term trend growth of around 3% annually in 2021 came against the backdrop of a strong but uneven global economic recovery, and differing growth dynamics for the major lines of business. Premiums in commercial P&C insurance lines, including workers compensation, grew the most, up by 4% in real terms on the back of the continued rate hardening in commercial lines and the economic recovery.\n\nFor global health insurance, Swiss Re estimates real premium growth of 4% in 2021, driven by a strong US economy and stable demand from the advanced markets. In emerging markets with often less well-developed public health systems, higher risk awareness will likely increase demand for health-related insurance covers. In China, government initiatives are supporting demand. For personal lines business, Swiss Re projects less strong global premium growth of 2%. A main factor here will be weak demand for motor insurance in advanced markets, alongside an estimated 7% drop in premium volumes in China due to de-tariffication rate cuts.\n\nBy region, non-life premiums in the advanced regions grew by 3% in real terms in 2021, driven by strength in commercial business, but weakness in motor insurance in North America and EMEA. The motor segment saw strong price competition in 2021 after significant underwriting gains in 2020. There was a resumption in growth in the emerging markets in 2021 with premiums up 6% in real terms after a sluggish 2020. Emerging Asia and Latin America exhibited a broad-based recoveries, with region non-life premiums up 6% and 5% respectively. Emerging EMEA lagged once again, with premium volumes up around 3%.\n\nPricing in non-life insurance commercial lines strengthened again in 2021, with an upswing across lines of business and by region. There were strong price increases in property (9% in the third quarter) and in financial and professional liability (FinPro) (+32%) lines in almost all regions. For property, rates have been mainly driven by natural catastrophe-related covers, and in FinPro by rising D&O claims. Prices in casualty showed 6% improvements, driven mainly by gains in the US and Europe, while Asia and Latin America remained sluggish.\n\nSwiss Re estimates the overall profitability of the non-life insurance sector, measured by return on equity (ROE), at 6% in 2021, down from an already low 7% in 2020. The 2021 performance is mostly driven by lower underwriting results as earnings in motor returned to trend after a huge lockdown-driven gains in 2020.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSwiss Re forecasts above-trend real non-life premium growth of 4% in 2022. Sentiment in commercial lines business points to continued hard market momentum in 2022, reflecting strong demand and inflation-induced higher claims developments. Improvements in sector profitability will largely depend on underwriting performance, pointing to the need for more rate increases and underwriting discipline.",

The expansion was driven by strength in commercial lines, which accounts for most of the demand from primary insurers. Reinsurance prices were higher for both non-proportional and proportional contracts. Demand from advanced markets grew by 5%, while emerging markets expanded by 4% in real terms.\n\nIn terms of profitability, the P&C reinsurance sector registered ROE of around 12% in 2021, the first year of a double-digit outcome since 2017, after four years of sub-par average ROE of around 5%. Preliminary data indicate a sector combined ratio of around 97% for 2021, an improvement from 105% in 2020 and 101% in 2019.\n\nReinsurers' underwriting results in 2021 were impacted by three main factors. On the positive side, the underlying, catastrophe adjusted underwriting result improved as reinsurance price hardening continued and even gained momentum at the January 2021 renewals, where about 50-60% of contracts were renewed. The absence of major COVID-19 claims in 2021 also offered support, as the non-life re/insurance industry quickly adapted underwriting procedures and policies to the new pandemic situation. In 2020, COVID-19 related claims accounted for nine percentage points of the sector combined ratio.\n\nOn the negative side, natural catastrophe activity was above-average throughout 2021 and full year insured losses are anticipated at more than USD 110 billion for the industry. This would make 2021 the fourth-costliest year on record for the insurance industry after 2005, 2011 and 2017. Among the costliest events were winterstorm Uri in Texas, Hurricane Ida which made landfall in Louisiana and also led to severe flash floods and tornadoes in the mid-Atlantic and northeastern regions, and the severe floods in Germany and Belgium. Swiss Re estimates natural catastrophes will add around 10% to the industry's 2021 combined ratio.\n\nThe sector's capital base remains very strong, allowing reinsurers to fulfill their role as the backbone of the primary insurance industry and to support societal resilience. Global sector capital grew by around 3% in nominal terms during 2021. There was a slowdown in traditional reinsurance capital growth to 3% in 2021 from 7% in 2020 and 11% in 2019. This was countered by a 3% gain in the alternative capital base, after two years of retrenchments and sluggish results. The main driver for the improving alternative capital sector in 2021 was the record-high issuances of cat bonds.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nFor the next renewal round in 2022, Swiss Re expects a further increase of reinsurance prices. This is consistent with the primary non-life market sentiment and reflects high insured losses from natural catastrophes. Premium income for the reinsurance industry is forecast to grow by 5-7% in 2022 and 2023, driven by higher exposures and higher prices.",

Around 80% of premium income in life insurance is derived from savings and retirement products.\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global life insurance premiums grew by 5% in real terms in 2021. Increased consumer risk awareness in the wake of COVID-19 has raised demand for protection products, while improved stock market performance and base effects will support a stronger rebound in savings business in 2021. Besides rising risk awareness, a recovery in group business and increased digital interaction also supported growth in 2021.\n\nOverall real premium growth in advanced markets was 6%, however, this growth was unevenly distributed between the US, advanced EMEA and advanced Asia Pacific. Premium growth was above-trend in both advanced EMEA and Asia-Pacific excluding China. In the US, premium growth will likely be subdued compared to 2020. The strong demand in 2020 was driven by an increase in stable-value group annuity premiums in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The demand for stable-value products receded in 2021.\n\nChina had a transitional year in 2021 with life insurance premiums estimated to have declined in real terms. Sales of life policies dropped due to a significant shrinkage in the number of life insurance sales agents, and a revision of the definition of critical illness (CI) and pricing directives of associated products.\n\nEmerging markets excluding China recovered strongly, with above-trend real life premium growth estimated at 7% in 2021. In emerging Asia (excluding China), Swiss Re estimates premiums to have grown by 7% 2021, supported by economic revival, rising risk awareness, use of digital distribution channels and liberalisation of life sector business. Latin America is benefiting from a strong increase in demand for all life and health-related business, with the first half of 2021 stronger than anticipated in several countries.\n\nOverall profitability of the global life insurance sector, as measured by GAAP ROE of major listed life insurance companies, improved in the first half of 2021 from 2020. Stronger stock markets and slightly higher 10-year government bond yields should support insurers' investment returns this year. That said higher mortality, low interest rates and tightening bond spreads continued to present a challenge to earnings in 2021.\n\nLife insurers are adjusting their product portfolios to cope with persistently low interest rates, for instance by moving more towards biometric risk and away from guarantees in investment-based products. Insurers are moving quickly to fee-based product offerings.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nSwiss Re expects real premium growth to remain above trend in 2022 and 2023 with 3% growth for each year. Protectiontype products should see strong demand, supported by higher risk awareness, a recovery in group business and increased digital interaction. Swiss Re expects savings business to grow moderately in 2022 and 2023, reflecting a recovery in employment and household incomes. Downside risk to both segments may come from new COVID-19 variants that lead to lockdowns and above-average mortality among insured populations.",

        "page_content": "## Reinsurance life\n\n110 Market size in USD billions\n\nEstimated global premium income in 2021\n\n4 % Market growth Estimated global premium growth in 2021\n\n## Market overview\n\nGlobal life and health reinsurance business generated premium income of around USD 110 billion in 2021. More than two-thirds of this is attributable to the US, Canada, the UK and China. Ceding companies from emerging markets accounted for 23% of global demand. Life reinsurers are increasingly diversifying away from traditional mortality business.\n\n## Market performance\n\nSwiss Re estimates that global life and health reinsurance premiums grew by 4% in real terms in 2021. Expansion was unevenly distributed between segments and was stronger in the emerging than advanced markets. Medical expense reinsurance premiums from emerging markets were up more than 11% in real terms, mainly driven by China, India, and the UAE. Globally, premiums in this segment were up 7% in real terms, contrasting strongly with more sluggish demand for mortality reinsurance.\n\nAgainst this background, life reinsurers have sought to increase revenues through large, individual risk transfer transactions that help primary insurers stabilise income and/ or bolster their balance sheets. The introduction of risk-based capital regimes has prompted much of this activity. Another area of growth has been longevity risk transfer. The availability of longevity reinsurance has become key to the pricing of annuity transactions, as insurers offering the said transactions to pension funds typically look to simultaneously access reinsurance capacity to hedge at least part of the associated longevity risk inherent in these lines.\n\nThe operating margin of the life reinsurance sector fell to around 3% of revenues in 2021, down from 3.5% in 2020 and from 7-8% achieved between 2015 and 2019. The underwriting performance was again significantly impacted by elevated mortality claims due to COVID-19. The contribution from investments improved slightly in the first nine months of 2021.\n\n## Market outlook\n\nContinued recovery in primary insurance should support growth in life and health reinsurance revenues, including a recovery in traditional business. In real terms, Swiss Re forecasts global life and health reinsurance premiums to increase by around 3% in 2022 and by 4% and 2023. While India and China will continue to be the main drivers, it is expected that growth will remain above trend in other emerging markets, advanced Europe and advanced Asia-Pacific as well.",

We have worked hard to strengthen business performance, with a rigorous focus on portfolio quality and underwriting excellence. Our 2021 results are a testament to these efforts, and we are convinced our performance will continue to improve.'\n\nChristian Mumenthaler Group Chief Executive Officer\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Group results\n\nSwiss Re reported net income of USD 1.4 billion for 2021, driven by strong performance of its property and casualty businesses.\n\n## Strategy and priorities\n\n2021 marked an important turning point for Swiss Re. Despite major COVID-19 impacts and a high occurrence of large natural catastrophe events throughout the year, the Group rebounded to a USD 1.4 billion profit.\n\nAll businesses worked hard to strengthen business performance, with a rigorous focus on portfolio quality and underwriting excellence. Swiss Re's 2021 results are a testament to these efforts.\n\nSwiss Re's property and casualty businesses both excelled in 2021, substantially increasing profitability and meeting their respective normalised 1 combined ratio targets.\n\nProperty & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) achieved a normalised combined ratio of 94.7% in 2021, in line with its target of less than 95% for the full year. At the same time, Corporate Solutions' normalised\n\ncombined ratio was 95.0%, well below the full-year target of less than 97%.\n\nThe property and casualty businesses continue to benefit from favourable pricing trends. This was once again exemplified in the January 2022 renewals, where P&C Re achieved a price increase 2 of 4% in this renewal round. This fully offset more conservative loss assumptions, which reflect a prudent view on inflation and other changes in exposure.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) incurred substantially higher COVID-19-related claims and reserves of almost USD 2 billion in 2021. Despite the persistent impact of COVID-19, L&H Re continued to strengthen its underlying business.\n\nExcluding COVID-19 losses, L&H Re further improved its underlying net income, which increased by 26% year on year to USD 1.1 billion.\n\n- 1 Normalised combined ratio assumes average large natural catastrophe loss burden and excludes prior-year reserve development as well as the COVID-19 impact.\n- 2 Price change defined as change in premiums net of commissions /claims; price change assumes constant portfolio mix.",

        "page_content": "iptiQ has successfully grown and continues to develop a global team focused on supporting existing and new partners. The pandemic is accelerating the shift towards digital insurance channels and embedded insurance, resulting in a strong pipeline of new opportunities for iptiQ. In addition, iptiQ is well-positioned to take advantage of the increasing sophistication and digitalisation of the retail insurance value chain.\n\nSupported by the increased underlying earnings power of the business, favourable market outlook and continued cost discipline, Swiss Re published new ambitious financial targets for the Group. Swiss Re targets to increase its US GAAP Group return on equity (ROE) to 10% 3 in 2022 and to 14% 4 in 2024, as it focuses on driving profitable growth across all businesses. In addition, Swiss Re maintains its economic net worth (ENW) per share growth target of 10% per annum.\n\nFor 2022, Swiss Re expects the performance of its property and casualty businesses to continue to improve, reaping the benefits of the Group's sustained focus on portfolio quality in combination with increasing prices. P&C Re targets a normalised combined ratio of less than 94% for 2022, while Corporate Solutions aims for a reported combined ratio of less than 95%.\n\nL&H Re continues to offer attractive business development opportunities, although it is likely to remain impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022. Taking this into account, L&H Re targets a net income of approximately USD 300 million for the year.\n\n## Performance\n\nSwiss Re reported a net income of USD 1.4 billion in 2021, considerably rebounding from a net loss of USD 878 million in 2020. This result was achieved as the Group absorbed large natural catastrophe losses of USD 2.4 billion across its businesses as well as total COVID-19-related claims of USD 2.0 billion. The vast majority of the COVID-19 losses originated in the L&H Re business, while impacts on the property and casualty\n\nbusinesses were minimal. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19, Swiss Re's net income was USD 3.0 billion, which is an increase of 39%.\n\nThe net operating margin 5 for the year 2021 was 5.1%, compared with -1.1% for 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 losses decreased to USD 2.0 billion in 2021 from USD 3.9 billion in 2020. The vast majority of the COVID-19 losses were attributable to the L&H Re business, while the impact on the property and casualty businesses was minimal in 2021.\n\nIn 2021, P&C Re reported a net income of USD 2.1 billion, compared with a net loss of USD 247 million in 2020. The 2021 result reflects the improved quality of the portfolio and rate increases, as well as favourable investment results.\n\nThe business absorbed large natural catastrophe losses of USD 2.1 billion in 2021, mainly relating to Hurricane Ida and the floods in Europe in the third quarter, as well as the US winter storm Uri in the first quarter. The net operating margin was 11.6%, compared with 0.1% in the prior year.\n\nL&H Re reported a net loss of USD 523 million, down from a net income of USD 71 million in 2020, as the business incurred substantially higher COVID-19related claims and reserves of almost USD 2 billion. These losses were primarily driven by the heightened COVID-19-related mortality rates in the US and reflected the spike in infection rates at the beginning of the year as well as during the third and fourth quarters.\n\nExcluding COVID-19, L&H Re improved its net income to USD 1.1 billion for 2021. This reflects a significant increase from USD 855 million (excluding COVID-19) for 2020, primarily driven by the good underwriting performance across all regions, favourable investment results and positive one-off effects from in-force management actions.\n\n- 3 Group ROE target for 2022 includes current expectations of COVID-19 losses.\n- 4 As of 2024, Swiss Re Group will report under IFRS. Current modelling indicates that the equivalent IFRS target will be higher than 14%.\n- 5 Net operating margin is calculated as 'Income before interest and income tax expense' divided by 'Total revenues' excluding 'Net investment result - unit-linked and with-profit business'.\n\n<!-- image -->",

The result was supported by a strong investment result with a return on investments (ROI) of 3.2%. The net operating margin was -2.1% in 2021 and 2.9% in 2020.\n\nCorporate Solutions reported net income of USD 578 million in 2021, compared with a net loss of USD 467 million in 2020, as the Business Unit continued to benefit from the implemented strategic actions. Large natural catastrophe losses amounted to USD 345 million, mainly relating to US winter storm Uri, Hurricane Ida and the central US tornadoes in December 2021 as well as large man-made losses of USD 249 million.\n\nShareholders' equity for the Group, excluding non-controlling interests, decreased to USD 23.6 billion as of 31 December 2021, compared with USD 27.1 billion at the end of December 2020. This reflected unrealised losses on fixed income securities of USD 3.0 billion and a payment to shareholders of USD 1.9 billion for the 2020 regular dividend, partially offset by the net income for 2021. Group ROE was 5.7% for 2021, compared with -3.1% for the prior year. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19, ROE was 11.6%.\n\nEarnings per share for 2021 were USD 4.97 or CHF 4.52, up from USD -3.04 or CHF -2.97 for 2020. Book value per share stood at USD 81.56 or CHF 74.30 at the end of 2021, compared with USD 93.90 or CHF 83.00 at the end of 2020. Book value per share is based on shareholders' equity and excludes non-controlling interests.\n\n## Business performance\n\nSwiss Re continued to grow all its businesses, increasing net premiums earned and fee income for the Group by 4.8% compared with the previous year to USD 42.7 billion in 2021. At constant foreign exchange rates, premiums and fees increased by 2.3%.\n\nGross premiums written increased by 8.6% to USD 46.7 billion in 2021, mainly reflecting price improvements, large transactions and favourable foreign exchange developments.\n\nP&C Re's net premiums earned grew by 5.3% to USD 21.9 billion, supported by continued price improvements, disciplined underwriting as well as favourable foreign exchange developments. At constant exchange rates, premiums earned increased by 3.3%. The P&C Re combined ratio improved to 97.1% in 2021 from 109.0% in the prior year, mainly driven by significantly lower COVID-19 losses.\n\nL&H Re's net premiums earned and fee income increased by 7.1% to USD 14.9 billion at improved margins in 2021, up from USD 13.9 billion in the prior year. This was supported by large transactions and favourable foreign exchange developments. At constant exchange rates, premiums earned and fee income increased by 3.7%.\n\nCorporate Solutions' net premiums earned increased to USD 5.3 billion from USD 5.0 billion in the prior year. This was driven by further rate increases in the context of the continued focus on underwriting quality, selective new business growth as well as an improved customer and broker distribution franchise. Favourable foreign exchange developments further helped offset the impact of the previous portfolio pruning actions. Corporate Solutions achieved risk-adjusted price increases of 12% 6 for the year. At constant exchange rates, net premiums earned increased by 4.4% year on year.",

This represents a 95% increase compared with 2020. All markets developed positively and contributed to this growth, in particular the EMEA property and casualty business since its successful launch in 2020.\n\nIn addition to growing revenues, iptiQ recorded USD 53 million of adjusted gross income 7 for 2021. This represents an increase of 39% compared with the previous year.\n\niptiQ had over 1.6 million in-force policies at the end of 2021.

Globally, iptiQ works with 51 distribution partners, representing a net increase of 11 compared with end of year 2020.\n\n## Investment result and expenses\n\nThe Group's non-participating investment portfolio decreased from USD 125.7 billion at the end of 2020 to USD 121.2 billion in 2021, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates.\n\nThe ROI was 3.2% for 2021, compared with 3.5% for 2020. The strong investment result, though lower than in the prior year, was driven by recurring income and significant equity valuation gains. The Group continues to manage its investment portfolio with a focus on delivering sustainable income.\n\nThe Group's non-participating net investment income was USD 3.4 billion in 2021, compared with USD 3.0 billion in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by private equity valuations and listed equity dividends. The Group's recurring income yield was 2.2% in 2021, compared with 2.4% in 2020, reflecting turnover into lower yields.\n\nThe Group reported non-participating net realised gains of USD 0.5 billion in 2021, compared with USD 1.7 billion in 2020. The decrease is mainly due to reduced gains from sales of fixed income securities.\n\nAcquisition costs for the Group were stable and amounted to USD 8.2 billion in 2021.\n\nOperating expenses were USD 3.5 billion in 2021, compared with USD 3.6 billion in 2020. Interest expenses were USD 571 million in 2021, slightly down from USD 588 million in 2020.\n\nThe Group reported a tax charge of USD 394 million on a pre-tax income of USD 1.8 billion for 2021, compared to a tax benefit of USD 266 million on a pre-tax loss of USD 1.1 billion for 2020. This translates into an effective tax rate in the current and prior-year reporting periods of 21.5% and 24.4%, respectively. The tax rate in 2021 was driven by profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions and tax charges from non-deductible expenses, partially offset by tax benefits from the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and foreign currency translation differences between statutory and US GAAP accounts.",

        "page_content": "## Making the world more resilient\n\nIn 2021, the Reinsurance business supported over 3 500 clients with over USD 26 billion of claims payments.\n\nThe main concern for L&H Re clients was excess mortality caused by the further spread of COVID-19, especially the Delta variant. For COVID-19 alone, L&H Re booked USD 2.0 billion in claims and reserves.\n\nAcross its business, over 237 million family members, loved ones and caregivers could count on L&H Re to provide them with protection, financial support and security.\n\nOn the P&C side, Reinsurance supported its clients, absorbing large natural catastrophe losses of USD 2.1 billion, driven by increased frequency and severity of secondary perils caused by climate change - such as floods, droughts, and wildfires especially in Europe and North America.\n\n## Looking forward: A strategy that works\n\nReinsurance continues to live its purpose of making the world more resilient and remains committed to its strategy of partnering with clients across the three proven pillars: core, transactions, and solutions. Reinsurance will drive innovation in risk knowledge and create greater opportunities for efficiency across these strong foundations.\n\nIn the core business, clients seek more income and capital protection from traditional reinsurance products as they grow their own businesses.\n\nL&H Re will continue to serve its clients with capacity and risk transfer in attractive areas such as longevity and mortality, where increased awareness of higher risks is driving demand. For example, the pandemic is elevating the need for mortality products, while rising life expectancies globally require more solutions for financial protection after retirement.\n\nOn the P&C side, a large part of the Reinsurance capacity focuses on natural catastrophes, where higher frequency and severity of losses are causing primary insurance companies to seek more protection. Reinsurance also supports clients' needs in casualty and specialty lines.\n\nSwiss Re's natural catastrophe business is robust and the premium income over the last decade has been strong enough to cover claims and absorb volatility for our clients while providing attractive long-term returns for our shareholders. Moving forward, Swiss Re will continue to carefully factor in climate change and other macro risk drivers in its sound pricing models. Reinsurance's clients can also draw upon the Group's deep risk knowledge and data-driven underwriting approach to better understand existing and emerging risks.\n\nThe Business Unit has dedicated transaction teams who provide customised reinsurance structures. These tailored transactions help clients when they seek strong growth, target an acquisition or undergo a transition in their portfolio or strategy.\n\nIn addition, Reinsurance continues to invest in its innovative solutions offering based on advancements in technology and analytical tools. The suite of digital and technologybased platforms helps clients grow, improve profitability in underwriting and operate more efficiently. For example, it has enabled clients with near real-time wildfire and flood monitoring, climate scenarios or post-event damage assessment. In the automotive space, solutions leverage telematics and behavioural economics for autonomous and electric vehicles, advanced commercial auto and shared mobility.\n\n## Summary\n\nSwiss Re's Reinsurance Business Unit is well-positioned to deploy its capital at attractive returns and to continue its successful financial performance. It remains committed to its outstanding partnerships with clients and stakeholders and a proven strategy of core, transactions and solutions. The ambition is to close protection gaps and make the world more resilient. This involves helping clients making relevant, affordable insurance protection available to a growing number of customers.\n\nReinsurance will drive innovation in risk knowledge and create greater opportunities for efficiency for its clients while remaining committed to sustainability across its operations, investment portfolio and underwriting.",

This turnaround was supported by portfolio actions that led to a more resilient and balanced book. Rate increases, positive prior-year development as well as strong investment results contributed further. COVID-19-related losses amounted to USD 106 million, significantly below 2020 levels due to dedicated portfolio actions.\n\nLarge natural catastrophe losses amounted to USD 2.1 billion for 2021, including Hurricane Ida and the floods in Europe, as well as the US winter storm Uri. P&C Re's large natural catastrophe losses remained below the premiums earned for this class of business. Large man-made losses amounted to USD 291 million for 2021. Prior-year development was favourable as natural catastrophe reserve releases were larger than the proactive reserving actions on casualty claims inflation. This contrasts to the 2020 results, which were impacted by a lower natural catastrophe loss burden but significant unfavourable prior-year developments in casualty.\n\nThe investment portfolio performance resulted in a strong return on investments (ROI) of 3.3% for 2021, supported by favourable private equity valuations, market value gains on equity and gains from sale of real estate.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned grew by 5.3% to USD 21.9 billion, benefitting from continued price improvements, disciplined underwriting as well as favourable foreign exchange developments. Gross premiums written increased by 8.1% to USD 23.2 billion in 2021.\n\n## Property & Casualty Reinsurance results\n\n| USD millions                                                     | 2020    | 2021    | Change in %   |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|\n| Revenues                                                         |         |         |               |\n| Gross premiums written                                           | 21 512  | 23 246  | 8             |\n| Net premiums written                                             | 20 636  | 22 381  | 8             |\n| Change in unearned premiums                                      | 196     | -455    |               |\n| Premiums earned                                                  | 20 832  | 21 926  | 5             |\n| Net investment income                                            | 1 178   | 1 613   | 37            |\n| Net realised investment gains/losses                             | 683     | 542     | -21           |\n| Other revenues                                                   | 26      | 20      | -23           |\n| Total revenues                                                   | 22 719  | 24 101  | 6             |\n| Expenses                                                         |         |         |               |\n| Claims and claim adjustment expenses                             | -16 403 | -14 773 | -10           |\n| Acquisition costs                                                | -5 104  | -5 359  | 5             |\n| Operating expenses                                               | -1 200  | -1 162  | -3            |\n| Total expenses before interest expenses                          | -22 707 | -21 294 | -6            |\n| Income before interest and income tax   expense                  | 12      | 2 807   | -             |\n| Interest expenses                                                | -321    | -296    | -8            |\n| Income/loss before income tax expense                            | -309    | 2 511   | -             |\n| Income tax expense/benefit                                       | 62      |         | -             |\n|                                                                  |         | -413    |               |\n| Net income/loss before attribution of non-controlling  interests | -247    | 2 098   |               |\n| Income/loss attributable to non-controlling interests            |         | -1      |               |\n| Net income/loss attributable to common shareholders              | -247    | 2 097   | -             |\n| Claims ratio in %                                                | 78.7    | 67.4    |               |\n| Expense ratio in %                                               | 30.3    | 29.7    |               |\n| Combined ratio in %                                              | 109.0   | 97.1    |               |\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nThe P&C Re combined ratio improved markedly to 97.1% for 2021 from 109.0% in 2020. Increased margins and significantly lower COVID-19-related losses were the main cause for the turnaround. On a normalised1 basis, P&C Re achieved a combined ratio of 94.7%, in line with the full-year target of less than 95% for the full year.\n\n## Administrative expense ratio2\n\nThe administrative expense ratio decreased to 5.3% in 2021, compared with 5.8% in 2020. This improvement resulted from growing the business at a constant expense basis.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nThe property combined ratio improved significantly to 92.2% in 2021, compared with 109.4% a year earlier. Portfolio management actions reduced frequency loss exposure in a year of heavy loss activity, while prior-year reserve releases added to the positive result. Large losses were mainly due to Hurricane Ida and the European floods as well as US winter storm Uri.\n\nThe casualty combined ratio was 104.7% in 2021, compared with 111.8% in 2020. Prior-year development significantly improved as a result of the dedicated focus on reserve level adequacy. 2020's result included COVID-19-related losses of 3.2 percentage points and an adverse prior-year experience.\n\n- 2 Operating expenses divided by premiums earned.",

The decrease was mainly due to fewer realised gains on sales within the fixed income portfolio, partially offset by market value gains on equity securities.\n\nInsurance-related investment results and foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the figures above.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity increased to USD 9.5 billion as of 31 December 2021, compared with USD 9.2 billion as of 31 December 2020. The net income contributed to the increase in shareholders' equity and is more than compensating the lower unrealised gains.\n\n## Outlook\n\nThe casualty reinsurance portfolio focuses on profitability and selective growth across all regions, while navigating a marketplace with increasing ceding commissions, a dynamic inflation environment and decreasing cessions in some markets. Margin is improving across the casualty portfolio, fuelled by disciplined risk taking, rate increases and prudent terms and conditions.\n\nGrowth from transactions and solutions continues to provide a solid pipeline of new opportunities which meet Reinsurance's return requirements.\n\nFor property lines, loss-hit regions are seeing significant price increases, which are somewhat offset by increased loss models, yet still present good opportunities for growth in the areas that Swiss Re targets. In loss-free areas, price increases have been more modest, yet sufficient to absorb increased inflation expectations and generate attractive new business. Swiss Re remains disciplined in avoiding business with poor structures and contract wordings.\n\nSpecialty lines, especially cyber, engineering and credit & surety, show positive momentum and Swiss Re continues to capitalise on its leading franchise in these lines with selected growth.\n\nThanks to the successful January renewals and the continued positive market momentum, P&C Re now targets a normalised combined ratio of less than 94% for 2022.\n\n<!-- image -->",

These losses were primarily driven by the heightened COVID-19-related mortality rates in the US and reflected the spike in infection rates at the beginning of the year as well as during the third and fourth quarters.\n\nExcluding the after-tax impact of COVID-19related losses, net income increased to USD 1.1 billion in 2021, compared with USD 855 million in the previous year. This reflects the good underwriting performance across all regions, favourable investment results and positive one-off effects from in-force management actions.\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) was -8.6%, reflecting the after-tax impact of COVID-19related losses. Excluding this, the ROE was 15.7%, well above 10.4% in 2020, due to a significantly higher underwriting performance for the year as well as a lower average equity base in 2021.\n\n## Premiums\n\nNet premiums earned and fee income increased by 7.1% to USD 14.9 billion at improved margins in 2021, compared with USD 13.9 billion in 2020. This was supported by large longevity transactions and favourable foreign exchange developments. Gross premiums written in 2021 increased by USD 1.0 billion, or 6.7%, to USD 16.1 billion in 2020.\n\n## Net operating margin\n\nThe net operating margin, excluding the pre-tax impact of COVID-19-related losses, was 10.0% in 2021, compared with 9.4% in 2020.\n\n## Life & Health Reinsurance results\n\n| USD millions                                                        | 2020    | 2021    | Change in %   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------------|\n| Revenues                                                            |         |         |               |\n| Gross premiums written                                              | 15 067  | 16 071  | 7             |\n| Net premiums written                                                | 13 657  | 14 584  | 7             |\n| Change in unearned premiums                                         | 68      | 104     | 53            |\n| Premiums earned                                                     | 13 725  | 14 688  | 7             |\n| Fee income from policyholders                                       | 158     | 180     | 14            |\n| Net investment income - non-participating business                  | 1 140   | 1 044   | -8            |\n| Net realised investment gains/losses -   non-participating business | 445     | 302     | -32           |\n| Net investment result - unit-linked and with-profit   business      |         |         |               |\n|                                                                     | -32     | 63      | -             |\n| Other revenues                                                      | 4       | 3       | -25           |\n| Total revenues                                                      | 15 440  | 16 280  | 5             |\n| Expenses                                                            |         |         |               |\n| Life and health benefits                                            | -12 204 | -13 648 | 12            |\n| Return credited to policyholders                                    | 5       | -94     | -             |\n| Acquisition costs                                                   | -1 999  | -2 014  | 1             |\n| Operating expenses                                                  | -786    | -864    | 10            |\n| Total expenses before interest expenses                             | -14 984 | -16 620 | 11            |\n| Income/loss before interest and income tax expense                  | 456     | -340    | -             |\n| Interest expenses                                                   | -367    | -286    | -22           |\n| Income/loss before income tax expense                               | 89      | -626    | -             |\n| Income tax expense                                                  | -18     | 103     | -             |\n| Net income/loss attributable to common shareholders                 | 71      | -523    | -             |\n| Management expense ratio in %                                       | 5.2     | 5.4     |               |\n| Net operating margin in %                                           | 2.9     | -2.1    |               |\n\n## Management expense ratio\n\nThe management expense ratio was 5.4%, an increase from 5.2% in the prior year, primarily driven by a reallocation of internal costs and investments into strategic growth initiatives.\n\n## Lines of business\n\nEarnings before interest and income tax expenses (EBIT) for the life business decreased to USD -1.1 billion in 2021 from USD -168 million in 2020.

The results demonstrate that we are well-positioned in a positive market environment.'\n\nAndreas Berger\n\nCEO Corporate Solutions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Corporate Solutions\n\nCorporate Solutions reported strong net income and surpassed its normalised 1 combined ratio target for 2021.\n\n## Strategy and priorities\n\nCorporate Solutions reported strong net income of USD 578 million in 2021. This result was achieved as the Business Unit continued to benefit from the implemented strategic actions taken to transform the business back into a consistent earnings contributor to the Swiss Re Group, with disciplined underwriting, strict expense management and continued rate increases. Corporate Solutions successfully absorbed large natural catastrophe losses and man-made claims. The Business Unit achieved a normalised combined ratio of 95.0%, surpassing its goal of less than 97% for 2021.\n\nIn December 2021, Swiss Re agreed to sell elipsLife, while maintaining exposure to the attractive employee benefits risk pool through a long-term reinsurance partnership. The sale allows Corporate Solutions to focus on continuing the strong performance of its core commercial insurance business.\n\n## Performance\n\nCorporate Solutions reported a net income of USD 578 million for 2021, up from a COVID-19-driven net loss of USD 467 million for 2020. The significant net profit improvement of USD 1.0 billion follows the successful turnaround in 2020 and is supported by a strong prior-year development, in particular in property.\n\nThis significant improvement was achieved as the Business Unit continued to benefit from the implemented strategic actions. The business successfully absorbed large natural catastrophe losses of USD 345 million, mainly relating to Uri, Hurricane Ida and the tornadoes that affected the central US in early December, as well as large man-made losses of USD 249 million.\n\nThe net operating margin was 13.5%, compared with -10.7% for the prior year. Return on equity (ROE) was very strong at 22.3% for the year.\n\nThe investment performance also contributed to the result, with the investment result of USD 225 million, slightly below 2020 levels.\n\n## Premiums\n\nGross premiums written increased by 21.1% to USD 7.5 billion in 2021, with business written across all geographies at more adequate price levels. Corporate Solutions achieved risk-adjusted price increases of 12% 2 , as well as higher volume on elipsLife business.\n\nNet premiums earned were USD 5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 6.5% year on year. This was driven by further rate increases in the context of the continued focus on underwriting quality, selective new business growth as well as an improved customer and broker distribution franchise. Favourable foreign exchange developments further helped offset the impact of the previous portfolio pruning actions.\n\n## Combined ratio\n\nCorporate Solutions' combined ratio improved to 90.6% in 2021 from 115.5% in 2020. This was the result of disciplined underwriting, strict expense management, continued rate increases and positive prior-year development.",

The previous period was impacted by COVID-19-related losses mainly on the credit & surety portfolio.\n\nelipsLife's combined ratio improved by 11.5 percentage points to 99.6% for 2021, driven by a successful renewal season and slightly favourable prior-year development.\n\n## Investment result\n\nThe return on investment (ROI) was 2.0% for 2021, compared with 2.3% in 2020, with an investment result of USD 225 million, a decrease of USD 18 million compared with 2020.\n\nNet investment income decreased by USD 34 million to USD 136 million for 2021 compared with 2020, mainly due to the impact of the low-yield environment on the fixed income and short-term investment portfolio.\n\nNet realised gains were USD 89 million in 2021, compared with USD 73 million in 2020, reflecting market value gains on equity securities, partially offset by fewer realised gains on sales of fixed income securities.\n\n## Corporate Solutions results\n\n| USD millions                                                    | 2020   | 2021    | Change in %   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|---------|---------------|\n| Revenues                                                        |        |         |               |\n| Gross premiums written                                          | 6 185  | 7 492   | 21            |\n| Net premiums written                                            | 4 785  | 5 717   | 19            |\n| Change in unearned premiums                                     | 234    | -374    | -             |\n| Premiums earned                                                 | 5 019  | 5 3 4 3 | 6             |\n| Net investment income                                           | 156    | 121     | -22           |\n| Net realised investment gains/losses                            | 56     | 115     | 105           |\n| Other revenues                                                  | 5      | 12      | -             |\n| Total revenues                                                  | 5 236  | 5 591   | 7             |\n| Expenses                                                        |        |         |               |\n| Claims and claim adjustment expenses                            | -3 433 | -2 374  | -31           |\n| Life and health benefits                                        | -899   | -924    | 3             |\n| Acquisition costs                                               | -680   | -690    | 1             |\n| Operating expenses                                              | -783   | -851    | 9             |\n| Total expenses before interest expenses                         | -5 795 | -4 839  | -16           |\n| Income/loss before interest and income tax expense              | -559   | 752     | -             |\n| Interest expenses                                               | -32    | -26     | -19           |\n| Income/loss before income tax expense                           | -591   | 726     | -             |\n| Income tax expense/benefit                                      | 130    | -149    | -             |\n| Net income/loss before attribution of non-controlling interests | -461   | 577     | -             |\n| Income/loss attributable to non-controlling interests           | -6     | 1       | -             |\n| Net income/loss attributable to common shareholders             | -467   | 578     | -             |\n| Claims ratio in %                                               | 86.4   | 61.8    |               |\n| Expense ratio in %                                              | 29.1   | 28.8    |               |\n| Combined ratio in %                                             | 115.5  | 90.6    |               |\n\nInsurance-related derivative results and foreign exchange gains/losses are not included in the investment figures.\n\nCorporate Solutions offers insurance protection against weather perils and other risks, which is accounted for as derivatives.

The return on equity (ROE) was 22.3% in 2021, compared with -19.7% in 2020.\n\n## Outlook\n\nCorporate Solutions will target a reported combined ratio of less than 95% in 2022.\n\nCorporate Solutions' future path is centred around capturing profitable growth while leveraging distinctive competitive strengths with a focused portfolio strategy that will build resilience in all market cycles. This will be further supported by strategic investments to capture existing market opportunities and expand through innovative risk solutions, international programmes and data/digital solutions and services that help address customer pain points and industry inefficiencies.\n\nThe commercial insurance market experienced continued price gains in 2021, although at a reduced pace compared to 2020. Corporate Solutions expects rate increases to continue during 2022. As pricing deficiencies close and capital re-enters the market - which is already happening in some niche areas - rates may come under pressure. However, underlying loss trends, particularly around loss severity, should remain a source of upward pressure on rates.\n\nCOVID-19 created a large amount of uncertainty in underlying market profitability and, ultimately, premium trends.",

        "page_content": "Swiss Re's strong underwriting results stemmed from determined actions and steering the portfolio to a more attractive risk profile.'\n\n## Thierry L\u00e9ger\n\nChairman Swiss Re Institute & Group Chief Underwriting Officer\n\n## Swiss Re Institute\n\n## Underwriting performance in 2021\n\nThe Group delivered strong underwriting results in 2021, driven by the excellent underlying performance of Swiss Re's businesses in a challenging environment.\n\nBoth Property and Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) and Corporate Solutions achieved their target normalised 1 combined ratios and, based on their strong technical underwriting results, made a significant contribution to Group net income. P&C Re achieved an excellent normalised combined ratio of 94.7%, meeting its target of less than 95% for the full year. Corporate Solutions reported a normalised combined ratio of 95.0%, surpassing its target of less than 97%.\n\nLarge natural catastrophe losses once again marked the year. Events such as Hurricane Ida in August, the floods and hailstorms in Europe in June and July, US winter storm Uri in February, as well as other natural catastrophes, resulted in global insured losses of more than USD 110 billion for the industry. For P&C Re and Corporate Solutions businesses, the impact from COVID-19 diminished significantly.\n\nDespite these significant loss events for the industry, Swiss Re's premiums earned for this class of business have been significantly higher than the losses from natural catastrophes. This is the result of determined actions in Swiss Re's underwriting and steering the portfolio mix to a more attractive risk-return profile. Even though rates improved in 2021, a significant share of this business segment did not meet Swiss Re's return targets and Swiss Re has reduced underwritten exposure to Property aggregates for 2021 by more than USD 2 billion, resulting in a reduced exposure to 2021 natural catastrophe claims.\n\nIn casualty, Swiss Re has de-risked the casualty portfolio in North America, reducing treaty exposure to large corporate risk by over 60% since 2020 in view of continued social inflation trends and the worsening inflationary environment.\n\nFor specialty, Swiss Re has grown the attractive engineering and marine portfolios, while continuing to carefully manage exposure to credit & surety.\n\nLife and Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) delivered a return on equity (ROE) of -8.6% and was again significantly impacted by\n\n<!-- image -->\n\ncontinued excess COVID-19 mortality claims in the in-force book. While the US winter 2020/21 wave resulted in slightly higher overall excess mortality, the wave in the third and fourth quarters of 2021 featured higher excess mortality among the working age population and included large single claims.\n\nExcluding COVID-19 losses, L&H Re's underlying business performance was strong both for the in-force and new business books. The segment achieved an ROE, excluding COVID-19 losses, of 15.7%. This was primarily driven by a good underwriting performance and careful capital deployment across all regions. Swiss Re further grew its mortality book and carefully managed the exposure to health, especially critical illness.\n\nSwiss Re continues to adjust its risk appetite for more extreme mortality and disability risks and reflects the increased exposure in its pricing assumptions for new business.\n\niptiQ continued to successfully grow its business in L&H (US and EMEA) and in P&C in EMEA. iptiQ's gross income was impacted by excess mortality, including COVID-19 and, to a lesser extent, floods in Europe.",

        "page_content": "## Outlook 2022 and beyond\n\nKey themes for the industry in 2022 are shaping around contract clarity, economic and social inflation, sustainability, climate change and cyber.\n\n## Contract clarity\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has once again highlighted the need to focus on insurance and reinsurance contracts. The more complex the risk scenarios are, the higher the need to have clear alignment between the parties on the content of their contracts. It is critical that wordings reflect the intent of underwriters and that these open discussions between the contracting parties happen before the inception of the contract. The goal is to reduce ambiguities and exposure to unwanted risks, especially those that are novel or present a heightened level of complexity.\n\n## Economic and social inflation\n\nThe higher inflationary environment is the number one near-term macroeconomic risk for the insurance industry. Swiss Re expects the magnitude of the rise in economic inflation in 2022, particularly in advanced markets, to erode nominal growth of 6.5-7.5% in non-life premiums for the industry globally. Currently, Swiss Re's claim trends do not generally follow the headline inflation movements, which are also peaking. Nevertheless there is an observable rise in compensation in selected areas. Globally, the personal auto loss frequency has neared pre-pandemic levels as more people have been driving again, while severity has risen more quickly with the spike in costs for used cars, replacement parts and rentals - in particular in the US. The inflationary outlook is dependent on supply chains and excess demand normalising again after the withdrawal of the exceptional government stimulus measures put in place to combat the pandemic.\n\nElevated social inflation trends especially in the US are likely to continue. The COVID-19 crisis is likely to amplify rather than alleviate the societal factors in play, such as educational and health inequality that is leading to a hardening of the public sentiment and attitudes towards insurers' interpretation of coverage levels and limits. Re/insurance pricing adequacy and cautious limit deployment are essential for the industry to get ahead of higher claims activity.\n\n## Sustainability and climate change\n\nSwiss Re aims to achieve net zero in its underwriting by 2050. So far, the primary focus has been on a gradual reduction in underwriting coal, gas and oil business.\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re went one important step further and became a founding member of the Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA), convened by the UN Environment Programme's Principles for Sustainable Insurance Initiative (PSI). Swiss Re has taken the lead of the metrics workstream for insurance underwriting, supporting the development of an insurance industry standard for carbon accounting and target setting protocols, to meet the net-zero 2050 goal.\n\nDespite the challenges, there will be opportunities. In the coming 30 years, massive global investments will be required to transition society to net zero. Swiss Re expects the total primary P&C Re insurance premiums from the renewable energy market to increase by 40-90% from 2020 to 2030. In the transition to net zero, insurance can make a significant contribution and be a real partner for industry and society.\n\nAfter a benign period for the industry from 2012 to 2016, the underwriting years 2017 to 2021 mark a return to the normal pattern of annually growing natural catastrophe claims for the industry. Alongside climate change, economic growth, urbanisation, and urban sprawl are key drivers for this expansion. Approximately 50% of this risk pool, or approximately USD 35 billion per annum, stems from secondary perils. Despite volatility, natural catastrophe risk as a growing risk pool remains attractive for Swiss Re.\n\nIn a rapidly changing risk landscape, cutting-edge risk views and disciplined underwriting remain key to structuring and selecting business that meets Swiss Re's profit hurdles. In 2021, climate change and urbanisation effects have been further embedded into Swiss Re's selected natural catastrophe risk models: for example, with the inclusion of pluvial flooding.\n\n## Cyber\n\nAccelerated digitalisation fostered by the pandemic also means greatly increased cyber risks for individuals, businesses and society at large. The unprecedented rise in ransomware over the past couple of years resulted in increased claims and deteriorating cyber claims ratios. The insurance market reacted decisively in 2021 by focusing on risk quality and portfolio management, as well as improving pricing and terms and conditions.\n\nSwiss Re estimates the global cyber insurance market to stand at USD 8 billion. Much of the recent growth came through much-needed rate increases rather than rising exposure. The growth outlook for this risk pool is attractive, for the industry and Swiss Re. Nevertheless, Swiss Re accesses this market in a highly disciplined way and maintains an underweight market position.\n\nSwiss Re is committed to building a sustainable and profitable cyber insurance market, offering solutions and sizeable capacity for well-managed and transparently ceded risks, while prudently managing accumulation.\n\n## Profitable growth opportunities\n\nThe current re/insurance cycle offers many opportunities for Swiss Re to grow at profitable terms. In Reinsurance, there is increased demand from insurers to cover earnings volatility, for balance sheet protection and for optimising their insurance portfolio mix across P&C and L&H. Swiss Re expects growth in its core business and through selected attractive transactions. Corporate Solutions is expected to continue to benefit from the increasing risk awareness, a reinforced focus on terms and conditions and upwards pricing trends in most markets and segments.\n\nSwiss Re expects continued rate hardening into 2022. Underwriting excellence and discipline are key success factors in these uncertain and volatile times. All Swiss Re's businesses are well-positioned to benefit from improving market conditions and it expects to grow the portfolio at profitable terms, keeping a conversative risk profile.",

The higher allocation to risk assets contributed to the strong result, with private market investments providing additional income. Episodes of elevated financial market volatility also allowed Swiss Re to actively manage the portfolio, which further enhanced the investment performance, as did the continued focus on ESG criteria on a risk-adjusted basis.\n\nIn terms of key market developments, US 10-year Treasury yields rose to an intra-year high above 1.7% in late March as the yield curve steepened amid rising inflation and a still cautious Federal Reserve. However, as the year progressed, the Treasury yield curve flattened due to the expectations of tighter monetary policy.\n\nInvestment grade corporate credit spreads tightened further and reached a new post-pandemic low in June; they have widened again somewhat since then, not least in light of the change in monetary policy stance. Swiss Re was well-positioned for this environment, maintaining a high-quality stance on the asset class and being conscious of the risk-return profile offered in light of historically high valuations reached in June.\n\nFinally, equity markets capped off another stellar year with the S&P 500 (+27%) ending December near its record high as investors looked through surging Omicron caseloads to focus on the relatively lower hospitalisation rates. This led to significant market value gains in the equity portfolio, in both public and private exposure.",

The Group's nonparticipating investment portfolio decreased from USD 125.7 billion at the end of 2020 to USD 121.2 billion at the end of 2021, reflecting the impact of rising interest rates. The ROI was 3.2% for 2021, compared with 3.5% for 2020. The strong investment result, though lower than in the prior year, was driven by recurring income and significant equity valuation gains. The Group continues to manage its investment portfolio with a focus on delivering sustainable income.\n\nThe Group's non-participating net investment income was USD 3.4 billion in 2021, compared with USD 3.0 billion in 2020. The increase was mainly driven by private equity valuations and listed equity dividends. The Group's recurring income yield was 2.2% in 2021, compared with 2.4% in 2020, reflecting turnover into lower yields.\n\nThe Group reported non-participating net realised gains of USD 0.5 billion in 2021, compared with USD 1.7 billion in 2020. The decrease is mainly due to reduced gains from sales of fixed income securities.\n\n## Outlook\n\nSwiss Re expects global real economic growth to significantly slow down in 2022 from the record pace of 5.6% in 2021. Meanwhile, inflation is set to decline from its multi-decade high but will remain elevated, despite the expected tightening in monetary policy. This global picture suggests a more prudent outlook for financial markets with generally full asset valuations.\n\nThe investment portfolio remains broadly diversified across asset classes and underlying sectors in both public and private markets, with a high-quality tilt. Subject to market conditions, Swiss Re will continue to increase its allocation to private markets, which will further enhance overall portfolio diversification.\n\nSwiss Re also intends to expand its exposure to thematic investing; this will allow it to capture shifting value pools in the economy and effectively allocate long-term capital to industry segments that are going through innovative disruption. In addition, Swiss Re will continue its strategic efforts to enable outperformance, including our leadership in ESG and roadmap to a net-zero investment portfolio, and the application and integration of new technology across the investment process.\n\nFinally, Swiss Re will also continue to actively manage the investment portfolio and positioning throughout the year.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->",

This was supported by favourable developments on previous years' business from Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Re) and Corporate Solutions as well as a strong performance from investment activities. This was partially offset by COVID-19-related losses in Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Re) and an unfavourable contribution from Group items.\n\nThe EVM profit on new business was USD 1.4 billion in 2021, compared to USD 9 million in 2020. The 2021 result was driven by improved portfolio quality in P&C Re, transactional business growth in L&H Re and strong underwriting performance in Corporate Solutions. This was partially offset by continued investments in the open book businesses and overhead expenses in Group items.\n\nThe EVM loss from previous years' business amounted to USD 205 million in 2021, compared to an EVM loss of USD 4.3 billion in 2020. The result mainly reflected the impacts of COVID-19-related losses and adverse assumption updates in L&H Re, partially offset by reserve releases and other favourable developments in P&C Re and Corporate Solutions.\n\nInvestment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 872 million in 2021 compared to a profit of USD 683 million in 2020. The 2021 result reflected outperformance across alternative investments and equities as well as a positive contribution from credit investments. The 2020 result was driven by favourable interest rates impact on a net duration position and strong real estate investment performance.\n\nENW per share growth amounted to 10.7% in 2021, which is above the over-the-cycle target of 10%.\n\n## Key information\n\n| USD millions, unless otherwise stated       | 2020   | 2021   | Change in %   |\n|---------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------|\n| EVM profit                                  | -3 590 | 2 058  | -             |\n| Total contribution to ENW                   | -434   | 3 762  | -             |\n| Economic net worth (ENW)                    | 33 652 | 35 374 | 5             |\n| Economic net worth per share in USD         | 116.45 | 122.42 | 5             |\n| Economic net worth per share growth, % 1    | -0.1   | 10.7   |               |\n| Profit margin - new business, %             | 0.0    | 3.9    |               |\n| Profit margin - previous years' business, % | -16.1  | -0.7   |               |\n| Profit margin - investments, %              | 5.9    | 8.9    |               |",

        "page_content": "## Business segment performance\n\nP&C Re reported an EVM profit of USD 2.6 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of USD 2.0 billion in 2020. Strong EVM profit on new business of USD 580 million was driven by improved portfolio quality, partially compensated by large natural catastrophe losses. The casualty business achieved better margins due to sustained focus on disciplined underwriting. EVM profit on previous years' business was USD 855 million due to reserve releases for natural catastrophe and man-made losses, partially offset by proactive reserving on casualty claims inflation and US winter storm Uri losses. Favourable changes in capital costs due to diversification benefits as a result of the higher share of property in the portfolio mix further supported the result. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 1.2 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of USD 91 million in 2020. The 2021 profit reflected strong performance across alternative investments (both private equity and real estate) and listed equities, supported by rising interest rates on a net short duration position. The 2020 loss resulted from declining interest rates on a net short duration position, partially compensated by strong real estate investment performance.\n\nL&H Re reported an EVM profit of USD 116 million in 2021 compared to a loss of USD 207 million in 2020. EVM profit on new business of USD 1.3 billion reflected strong transactional business growth primarily in the US but also in the UK, as well as further profitable growth of core business across all regions. EVM loss on previous years' business of USD 1.4 billion included a significant impact from COVID-19-related losses of USD 1.2 billion, mainly reflecting mortality developments in the US. In addition, the result included adverse impacts from various assumption updates, while experience was slightly positive. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 206 million in 2021, compared to USD 551 million in 2020. The 2021 profit reflected a positive contribution from credit investments, partially offset by a negative impact from rising interest rates on a net long duration position. The 2020 EVM profit was driven by favourable interest rates impact on a net long duration position.\n\nCorporate Solutions reported an EVM profit of USD 835 million in 2021 compared to a loss of USD 902 million for 2020. EVM profit on new business of USD 230 million was driven by continued price momentum, growth in target areas and strong renewals, partially offset by large natural catastrophe losses, mainly Hurricane Ida and central US tornadoes as well as large man-made losses. Insurance in derivative form reported a profit of USD 13 million in 2021. EVM profit on previous years' business was USD 535 million, mainly driven by reserve releases in property from recent accident\n\nyears, releases on COVID-19 reserves built in 2020, and positive impacts of volume updates and lower capital costs. This more than compensated for large natural catastrophe losses, in particular US winter storm Uri, as well as large man-made losses in property and liability. Investment activities generated an EVM profit of USD 70 million in 2021, compared to a profit of USD 1 million in 2020. The 2021 profit reflected favourable equity performance and a positive contribution from credit investments.\n\nGroup items reported an EVM loss of USD 1.5 billion in 2021, compared to a loss of USD 328 million in 2020. The EVM loss on new business was USD 729 million in 2021, mainly driven by overhead expenses and capital costs on excess capital, as well as continued investment into building the iptiQ business, partially offset by trademark licence fee income from the business segments. The EVM loss on previous years' business was USD 195 million, mainly driven by unfavourable updates in the underwriting run-off businesses and increased overhead expenses. Investment activities generated an EVM loss of USD 582 million in 2021, compared to a profit of USD 413 million in 2020, reflecting underperformance from Principal Investments.",

In addition, the EVM balance sheet provides the basis for determining available capital under the Swiss Solvency Test (SST).\n\nThe EVM framework differs significantly from US GAAP, which is the basis on which Swiss Re prepares its consolidated financial statements. Swiss Re's EVM income statement (and its line items) should not be viewed as a substitute for the income statement (and its line items) in Swiss Re's US GAAP consolidated financial statements and Swiss Re's EVM economic net worth (ENW) should not be viewed as a substitute for shareholders' equity as reported in\n\nSwiss Re's US GAAP consolidated balance sheet. EVM results may be subject to significant volatility as assets and liabilities are measured on a market-consistent basis. As it is a proprietary framework, Swiss Re may change its EVM methodology from time to time.\n\nThe EVM financial information has been prepared in accordance with the Group's EVM principles and follows largely the same consolidation principles as used in the preparation of the Group's consolidated US GAAP financial statements.\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the reporting currency at closing exchange rates. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the reporting currency at average exchange\n\nrates for the reporting year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are recognised directly in ENW with no impact on the EVM income statement.\n\nEVM follows a closed-book principle and excludes the recognition of all potential future new business activities, including future renewals.\n\n## For details on the EVM valuation\n\nprinciples, performance attribution and differences to US GAAP, please consult our publication:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Measuring economic\n\nperformance & solvency at Swiss Re https://www.swissre.com/Library/ measuring-economic-performancesolvency-at-swiss-re.html",

Exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the Group.\n\nThe amount of liquidity held is largely determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events. Based on these internal liquidity stress tests, it is estimated that Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, the most important legal entity of the Group from a liquidity perspective, currently holds significant surplus liquidity.\n\nSwiss Re also provides FINMA, its principal regulator, with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA Circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers'.\n\n## Risk Management\n\nGroup Risk Management is key to the controlled risk-taking that underpins Swiss Re's financial strength. Risk Management is mandated to ensure that the Group and its legal entities have the necessary expertise, frameworks and infrastructure to support good risk-taking. In addition, it monitors and ensures adherence to applicable frameworks and also performs reserving and reporting activities.\n\nRisk Management is embedded throughout Swiss Re's business.

These are closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, but remain part of the Risk Management function under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks. They are supported in this by central risk teams that provide specialised risk expertise and oversight.\n\nThe Group's risk-taking is steered by Swiss Re's Risk Appetite Framework, which consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance. The risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk/return view. The risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nSwiss Re's proprietary integrated risk model provides a meaningful assessment of the risks to which the Group is exposed and represents an important tool for managing its business. It determines the capital requirements for internal purposes and forms the basis for regulatory reporting under the SST and under Solvency II for legal entities in the European Economic Area (EEA) and the United Kingdom.\n\nSwiss Re continuously reviews and updates its internal model and parameters to reflect the Group's experiences and changes in the risk environment and current best practice.\n\n## Swiss Re's risk profile\n\nIn SST 2022, Swiss Re's total risk increased to USD 22.7 billion (compared to USD 22.4 billion in SST 2021), driven by higher financial market risk, partially offset by lower insurance risk. These shifts led to a slight increase in diversification at risk category level.\n\nThe decrease in property and casualty risk is mainly driven by the inflation model change, the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar and higher interest rates. These effects are partially offset by an increase in natural catastrophe risk.\n\nLower life and health risk mainly reflects the impact of higher interest rates and the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar. The overall decrease is further supported by higher relief from new retrocession agreements and the diversification impact of new longevity business.\n\nFinancial market risk increased, mainly driven by the reduction of investment hedges, higher equity valuations and additional investments in private equity.\n\nCredit risk remained stable, as the reduction of hedges and addition of corporate bonds was largely offset by foreign exchange and interest rate movements.",

Reserves releases for natural catastrophe losses including US hurricanes and wildfires, weather-related events in Australia as well as typhoons in Asia and man-made losses further improved the result. This was partially offset by large natural catastrophe losses such as Hurricane Ida, European July floods and June hailstorm, US winter storm Uri, as well as riots in South Africa and proactive reserving actions on casualty claims inflation.\n- \u00b7 The positive underwriting contribution from Life & Health Reinsurance was mainly driven by strong transactional business growth primarily in the US but also in the UK, as well as further profitable growth of core business across all regions. This was partially offset by a significant impact from COVID-19related losses, mainly reflecting mortality developments in the US. In addition, the Life & Health Reinsurance underwriting contribution reflected unfavourable impacts from various assumption updates, including mortality improvements, while experience remained slightly positive.\n- \u00b7 Corporate Solutions positive underwriting contribution was mainly driven by continued price momentum, growth in target areas and strong renewals, as well as by reserve releases in property, and releases on COVID-19 reserves. This more than compensated for large natural catastrophe losses, mainly Hurricane Ida, central US tornadoes, US winter storm Uri as well as large man-made losses.\n- \u00b7 The Group items negative underwriting contribution was mainly driven by increased overhead expenses, as well as the continued investment into building the iptiQ business and unfavourable updates in the underwriting run-off business.\n\nThe positive investment contribution was mainly driven by outperformance across alternative investments and equities as well as a positive contribution from credit investments. This was partially offset by a negative contribution from Principal Investments.\n\nNegative foreign exchange impacts were mostly driven by the depreciation of major currencies against the US dollar.\n\nDeductions mainly reflect projected dividends (to be paid in 2022, subject to AGM 2022 approval) as well as deferred taxes on real estate.\n\nSupplementary capital is recognised as risk bearing under SST. The change in SST supplementary capital was due to market value movements.\n\nA description of the change in market value margin, which represents the capital costs for the run-off period, is provided together with the SST target capital comments below.\n\n## SST target capital (SST TC)\n\nSwiss Re uses an internal risk model to determine the economic capital required to support the risks on the Group's book, as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity to the different lines of business. The model also provides the basis for capital cost allocation in Swiss Re's EVM framework, which is used for pricing, profitability evaluation and compensation decisions. In addition to these internal purposes, the model is used to determine regulatory capital requirements under economic solvency frameworks such as SST and Solvency II.\n\nIn 2017, FINMA approved Swiss Re's internal model and its components for SST reporting purposes under their revised model review process.\n\nSince SST 2021, one major model change has been implemented. It was approved by FINMA in October 2021:\n\n- \u00b7 Inflation risk - The model was improved to capture risk more comprehensively, including the mitigation effect of contractual clauses, diversification with other risks and inclusion of additional exposures. The overall impact is an increase of the Group's SST ratio.\n\nThe risk exposure basis for SST is a projection for the period from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and is based on the economic balance sheet as of 31 December 2021 and adjustments to reflect 1 January 2022 business shifts.\n\nTo derive SST TC, total risk is adjusted for the line item Other impacts as shown below.\n\nSST target capital declined to USD 30.3 billion, mainly driven by the decrease in market value margin (included in Other impacts), partially offset by higher total risk (see Risk assessment p. 67 for details).\n\nOther impacts mainly reflect market value margin, the impact from business development over the forecasting period and requirements from FINMA that are not included in total risk because they are not consistent with Swiss Re's own risk view.\n\nThe decrease in market value margin is mainly driven by the increase in interest rates.\n\n## SST Target Capital\n\n| USD millions                             | SST 2021   | SST 2022   | Change   |\n|------------------------------------------|------------|------------|----------|\n| Total risk                               | 22 353     | 22 739     | 385      |\n| Other impacts                            | 8 735      | 7 548      | -1 187   |\n| SST target capital                       | 31 088     | 30 287     | -801     |\n| Market value margin                      | 11 780     | 10 851     | -929     |\n| SST target capital - market value margin | 19 308     | 19 4 3 6   | 128      |",

The Group's exposure to liquidity risk stems mainly from two sources: the need to cover potential extreme loss events and regulatory constraints that limit the flow of funds within the organisation.\n\nA range of liquidity policies and measures are in place to manage these risks, in particular to ensure that:\n\n- \u00b7 sufficient liquidity is held to meet funding requirements under current conditions as well as adverse circumstances;\n- \u00b7 funding is charged and credited at an appropriate market rate through Swiss Re's internal transfer pricing;\n- \u00b7 diversified sources are used to meet the Group's residual funding needs;\n- \u00b7 long-term liquidity needs are taken into account in the Group's planning process and in the management of financial market risk.\n\n## Liquidity risk management\n\nSwiss Re's core liquidity policy is to retain access to sufficient liquidity in the form of unencumbered liquid assets, cash and pre-funded facilities, to meet potential funding requirements arising from a range of possible stress events. To allow for regulatory restrictions on intra-Group funding, liquidity is managed from a legal entity perspective. The amount of liquidity held is determined by internal liquidity stress tests, which estimate the potential funding requirements stemming from extreme loss events.\n\nThe funding requirements under stress include:\n\n- \u00b7 Cash and collateral outflows, as well as potential capital and funding support required by subsidiaries as a result of loss events\n- \u00b7 Repayment or loss of all maturing unsecured debt and credit facilities\n- \u00b7 Additional collateral requirements associated with a potential ratings downgrade\n- \u00b7 Further contingent funding requirements related to asset downgrades\n- \u00b7 Other large committed payments, such as expenses, commissions and tax\n\nThe stress tests also assume that funding from assets is subject to conservative haircuts, intra-Group funding is not available if subject to regulatory approval, no new unsecured funding is available and funding from new re/insurance business is reduced.\n\nThe primary liquidity stress test is based on a one-year time horizon and a loss event corresponding to 99% tail value at risk (see page 67).\n\nSwiss Re's liquidity stress tests are reviewed regularly and their main assumptions are approved by the Group Executive Committee. Swiss Re provides FINMA with a yearly report on its liquidity position, in accordance with FINMA circular 13/5, 'Liquidity - Insurers.'\n\n## Liquidity position of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (SRZ)\n\nFrom a liquidity perspective, SRZ is the most important legal entity of the Group. The estimated total liquidity sources in SRZ available within one year, after haircuts and net of short-term loans from Swiss Re Ltd and securities lending, amounted to USD 29.7 billion as of 31 December 2021, compared with USD 26.7 billion as of 31 December 2020.\n\nBased on the internal liquidity stress tests described above, Swiss Re estimates that SRZ holds surplus liquidity after dividends to Swiss Re Ltd. In 2021, the amount of surplus liquidity decreased. This was largely driven by positive net operating cash flows and the reorganisation of the legal entity structure, more than offset by the changes in the investment portfolio, mark-to-market movements as well as changes in foreign exchange rates.",

Additional risk governance for legal entities is prepared as an addendum to the Group or parent entity document.\n\nGroup risk governance documents are organised hierarchically across five levels, which are mirrored by equivalent documents at legal entity (LE) level:\n\n- \u00b7 SRL Bylaws and the charter for the Group Finance and Risk Committee outline the ultimate authority for risk management, assigning responsibilities to the Group Board of Directors and the Group Executive Committee.\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Policy is defined by the Group Board and articulates Swiss Re's risk appetite framework (risk appetite and tolerance) as well as fundamental risk and capital structure principles.\n- \u00b7 The Group Risk Management Standards outline how the Group organises and applies its risk management practices.\n- \u00b7 Risk category standards describe how risk practices are implemented for a specific category.\n- \u00b7 The lowest level comprises risk management methodology and process documentation.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Key risk management principles\n\nSwiss Re's risk management is based on four fundamental principles. These apply consistently across all risk categories at Group and legal entity level:\n\n- \u00b7 Controlled risk-taking - Financial strength and sustainable value creation are central to Swiss Re's value proposition. The Group thus operates within a clearly defined risk policy and risk control framework.\n- \u00b7 Clear accountability - Swiss Re's operations are based on the principle of delegated and clearly defined authority. Individuals are accountable for the risks they take on, and their incentives are aligned with Swiss Re's overall business objectives.\n- \u00b7 Independent risk controlling - Dedicated units within Risk Management control all risk-taking activities. These are supported by Compliance and Group Internal Audit functions.\n- \u00b7 Open risk culture - Risk transparency, knowledge-sharing and responsiveness to change are integral to the risk control process. The central goal of risk transparency is to create a culture of mutual trust and reduce the likelihood of surprises in the source and potential magnitude of losses.\n\n## Fundamental roles for delegated risk-taking\n\nRisk-taking activities are typically subject to three lines of control. The first line comprises the day-to-day risk control activities performed by risk takers in the business as well as in Group functions, including proactive identification of risks, as well as establishing and operating an effective control system.\n\nIndependent oversight performed by functions such as Risk Management and Compliance represents the second line of control.\n\nThe third line consists of independent audits of processes and procedures carried out by Group Internal Audit or by external auditors. This approach is designed to achieve a strong, coherent and Group-wide risk culture built on the principles of ownership and accountability.",

This risk culture stands for the risk- and controlrelated values, knowledge and behaviour shared by all employees. Its principal components are summarised in a framework that builds on the Group's Code of Conduct as well as on key risk management principles in the Group Risk Policy.\n\nThe risk culture framework serves to influence appropriate risk-taking behaviour in four key aspects, which are assessed annually for all employees in the performance and compensation process:\n\n- \u00b7 Leadership in providing clear vision and direction\n- \u00b7 Consideration of risk-relevant information in decision-making\n- \u00b7 Risk governance and accountability of risk control activities as well as transparent flow of risk information\n- \u00b7 Embedding of risk management skills and competencies\n\nSwiss Re's risk culture provides the foundation for the efficient and effective application of its Group-wide risk management framework. Group Risk Management reinforces the risk culture by ensuring risk transparency and fostering open discussion and challenge in the Group's risk-taking and risk management processes.\n\nKey risk takers across Swiss Re are a particular focus in promoting good risk-and control-related behaviours. The relevant positions are identified in a regular process, and those who hold them are subject to additional behavioural objectives and assessments.\n\nRisk culture is directly linked to Swiss Re's performance management, which is based not only on business results but also on behaviours. Swiss Re's compensation framework aims to foster compliance and support sensible risk-taking. Swiss Re also has a range of incentive programmes that reflect the long-term nature of its business by rewarding sustained performance rather than short-term results. This helps to align shareholder and employee interests.\n\nSwiss Re's compensation principles and framework are captured within the Swiss Re Group Compensation Policy. The Group's Finance and Risk Committee conducts a regular risk assessment for all changes to this policy.",

It defines basic risk management principles and the risk appetite framework, including the Group's risk appetite and risk tolerance; in addition, it approves the Group's risk strategy. The Group Board mainly performs risk oversight and governance through three committees:\n\n- \u00b7 Finance and Risk Committee - defines the Group Risk Policy, reviews risk capacity limits, monitors adherence to risk tolerance, and reviews top risk issues and exposures.\n- \u00b7 Investment Committee - reviews the financial risk analysis methodology and valuation related to each asset class and ensures that the relevant management processes and controlling mechanisms are in place.\n- \u00b7 Audit Committee - oversees internal controls and compliance procedures.\n\nThe Group Executive Committee is responsible for developing and implementing Swiss Re's Group-wide risk management framework. It also sets and monitors major risk limits, oversees the Economic Value Management framework, determines product policy and underwriting standards, and manages regulatory interactions and legal obligations. The Group Executive Committee has delegated various risk management responsibilities to the Group Chief Risk Officer (Group CRO) as well as to certain legal entity CROs.\n\nThe Group CRO is appointed as the principal independent risk controller of Swiss Re. He is a member of the Group Executive Committee and reports directly to the Group CEO as well as to the Board's Finance and Risk Committee.

        "page_content": "The central risk management departments oversee Group liquidity and capital adequacy and maintain the Group frameworks for controlling these risks throughout Swiss Re. They also support CROs at Group and legal entity level in discharging their oversight responsibilities. They do so by providing services, such as:\n\n- \u00b7 Financial risk management\n- \u00b7 Specialised risk category expertise and accumulation control\n- \u00b7 Risk modelling and analytics\n- \u00b7 Regulatory relations management\n- \u00b7 Maintaining the central risk governance framework\n\nThe Risk Management function is also in charge of actuarial reserving and monitoring of reserve holdings for property and casualty business, while for life and health business the setting of the reserves is performed by valuation actuaries within L&H Business Management.\n\nThe business level Risk Management departments provide the expertise and resources for the control of insurance and operational risks within their respective business scope. The heads of these departments have a dual role, as they also serve as CROs of their respective businesses, with dotted lines to the business level CEO. Reinsurance Risk Management performs Group-level accumulation control for P&C and L&H risks in addition to its business level responsibilities.\n\nThe business level Risk Management departments are supported by functional and regional CROs, as well as by legal entity risk teams led by dedicated CROs who report directly or indirectly to their top-level entity CRO, with a secondary reporting line to their legal entity CEO. These legal entity CROs are responsible for risk oversight in their entities, as well as for establishing the proper risk governance to ensure efficient risk identification, assessment and control. They are supported by subsidiary CROs who are responsible for overseeing risk management issues that arise at regional or subsidiary level.\n\nWhile the Risk Management organisation is closely aligned to Swiss Re's business structure, in order to ensure effective risk oversight, all embedded teams and CROs remain part of the Group Risk Management\n\nfunction under the Group CRO, thus ensuring their independence as well as a consistent Group-wide approach to overseeing and controlling risks.\n\nRisk management activities are complemented by Swiss Re's Group Internal Audit and Compliance units:\n\n- \u00b7 Group Internal Audit performs independent, objective assessments of the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control systems. It evaluates the execution of processes within Swiss Re, including those within Risk Management.\n- \u00b7 The Compliance function oversees Swiss Re's compliance with applicable laws, regulations, rules and the Code of Conduct. It also assists the Group Board, Group Executive Committee and other management bodies in identifying, mitigating and managing compliance risks.\n\n## Risk control framework\n\nSwiss Re operates within a clearly defined risk control framework. This is set out in the Group Risk Management Standards and comprises a body of standards that establish an internal control system for taking and managing risk. These standards set responsibilities for risk takers and risk controllers. The risk control framework defines key tasks, which are the core components of Swiss Re's risk management cycle:\n\n- \u00b7 Risk tolerance and appetite assessment of plan - ensures that the risk implications of plans are understood and determines whether business and investment plans adhere to the internal risk appetite framework (risk appetite and tolerance).\n- \u00b7 Risk identification - ensures that all risks to which Swiss Re is exposed are transparent in order to make them controllable and manageable.\n- \u00b7 Risk measurement - enables Swiss Re to understand the magnitude of its risks and to set quantitative controls that limit its risk-taking.\n- \u00b7 Risk limit framework - allows Swiss Re to control its risk-taking decisions and total risk accumulations, including the passive risk it is exposed to through its operations.\n- \u00b7 Risk reporting - creates internal risk transparency and enables Swiss Re to meet external disclosure requirements.\n\nIn addition, Risk Management performs the following risk control activities:\n\n- \u00b7 Model and tool assurance - ensures that models or tools used for costing, valuation and risk capital determination are based on sound scientific concepts, have been implemented and calibrated correctly, and produce accurate results.\n- \u00b7 Valuation assurance - assesses the quality of valuations for financial instrument prices and reserves.\n- \u00b7 Insurance risk reviews - assess the quality of decision-making in the taking of insurance risks by performing independent evaluations of underwriting, costing, pricing and claims handling.\n\nSwiss Re has implemented a principlebased integrated internal control system to mitigate identified operational risks including financial reporting and compliance risks, as well as risks that could impair the effectiveness and efficiency of operations. This control system represents a subset of Swiss Re's risk control framework and is based on international standards established by COSO (the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission). It is applied on multiple organisational levels, including Group, functions, regions and legal entities.\n\n## Risk transfer\n\nTo efficiently manage capital across the Group and ensure that risk-taking in individual legal entities is well diversified, the Group employs internal retrocession and funding agreements. These serve to improve the fungibility of capital and consequently Group-wide diversification. In addition, the Group aims to maximise the amount of funds available centrally by optimising the excess capital held within its subsidiaries and branches.\n\nSwiss Re also manages and mitigates insurance risk through external retrocession, insurance risk swaps or by transferring risk to capital markets through insurance-linked securities, industry loss warranties or other derivatives. This provides protection against extreme catastrophic events, further diversifies risk, stabilises economic results and releases underwriting capacity.\n\nIn addition, Swiss Re uses financial market derivative instruments as well as financial market securities to hedge financial market",

        "page_content": "## Risk Appetite Framework\n\nThe risk appetite framework establishes the overall approach through which Swiss Re practices controlled risk-taking throughout the Group. The framework is set out in the Group Risk Policy and consists of two interlinked components: risk appetite and risk tolerance.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n|                          |               | Risk appetite                                               | Risk tolerance                        |\n|--------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Group   Risk Policy      | ur n p o r    | Risk appetite  statement                                    | Risk tolerance  objectives and limits |\n| Group   strategic plan   | mi se r i s k | Target liability  portfolio and strategic  asset allocation | Risk capacity limits                  |\n| Annual planning  process |               | Business plans                                              | Operational limits                    |\n\nand credit risks arising from investments and insurance liabilities. Interest rate risk from insurance liabilities is managed through investments in fixed-income instruments whose pricing is sensitive to changes in government yields, such as government bonds.\n\nTo meet the first objective, the Risk Policy defines internal respectability limits to ensure that the Group has enough resources to meet capital requirements at Group level as well as respectability and liquidity requirements for all legal entities. These limits ensure that Swiss Re has adequate capital and liquidity above minimum requirements to be considered a respectable counterparty by external stakeholders. To meet the second objective, Swiss Re's risk tolerance criteria includes internal resilience limits for SRZ to ensure that the main operating entity is able to withstand capital and liquidity stresses.\n\nTo meet the third objective, the Group has established a Group-wide risk matrix methodology in which key operational risks are assessed against an acceptable level of expected losses. Any operational risk exposure that exceeds the Group's internal operational risk tolerance limit is subject to a mitigation plan that is monitored by the Group's Finance and Risk Committee.\n\n## Risk appetite framework\n\nIn the context of business strategy and planning, the risk appetite statement facilitates discussions about where and how Swiss Re should deploy its capital, liquidity and other resources under a risk/ return view, while the risk tolerance sets clear boundaries to risk-taking.\n\nDuring strategic planning and targetsetting, Risk Management provides an opinion on the proposed strategy and targets to the Group Executive Committee and ultimately the Group Board. The opinion focuses on the risk impact of the proposed strategy and the risks related to its implementation. The strategic plan, risk appetite and capital allocation ambition are expressed in a target portfolio for the Group's assets and liabilities, which should ultimately deliver the Group's targeted performance.\n\nSwiss Re's risk appetite outlines the Group's own principles on acceptable risks and provides key directions for risk-taking and risk controlling as part of implementing Swiss Re's strategy: achieving targeted performance, providing liquidity and financial flexibility, managing capital adequacy, and protecting and growing franchise value.\n\nThe Group Board further details Swiss Re's risk appetite through its approval or review of the following key steering frameworks as part of the Group's planning process: target liability portfolio, strategic asset allocation and the Group's target capital structure.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance describes the extent to which the Group and SRZ Boards have authorised executive management to assume risk. It represents the amount of risk that Swiss Re is willing to accept within the constraints imposed by its capital and liquidity resources, its strategy, and the regulatory and rating agency environment within which it operates.\n\nSwiss Re's internal risk tolerance is based on the following objectives:\n\n- \u00b7 To maintain Group capital at a level that safeguards respectability with clients and regulators.\n- \u00b7 To ensure the resilience of SRZ as the main operating entity from a capital and liquidity perspective.\n- \u00b7 To avoid material operational risks that could subject the Group to large operational losses with corresponding consequences from an economic, reputational or regulatory perspective.\n\nInternal risk tolerance respectability criteria for the Swiss Re Group are set out in the Group Risk Policy. The Group and SRZ Boards are responsible for approving the risk tolerance criteria, as well as for monitoring and reviewing risk tolerance. Breaches or anticipated breaches of limits established to control the risk tolerance criteria must be communicated to the Finance and Risk Committee.\n\nSwiss Re's risk-taking is governed by a limit framework in order to ensure that accumulation risk and large losses remain at an acceptable level, as well as to steer the allocation of available risk capacity. The limit framework is rooted in the risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives set in the Group Risk Policy and helps to translate these objectives into concrete, measurable criteria. In addition, lower level limits are implemented to allocate scarce capacity. The limit framework also allows for risk monitoring and thus supports risk controlling during the execution of the plan.",

It is used to measure the Group's risk position and related capital requirements as well as for defining the risk tolerance, risk limits and liquidity stress tests.\n\nSwiss Re is exposed to insurance and financial risks that are calculated in its internal risk model, as well as other risks that are not explicitly part of the economic capital requirement but are actively monitored and controlled due to their significance for Swiss Re. These include operational, liquidity, model, valuation, regulatory, political, strategic and sustainability risks (see Swiss Re's risk landscape, p. 68).\n\nProperty and casualty risk is mainly driven by underlying risks inherent in the business Swiss Re underwrites, in particular natural catastrophe risk, non-life claims inflation, costing and reserving, and man-made risk. The main drivers of life and health insurance risk are mortality trend and lethal pandemic risk.\n\nThe Group's financial risk derives from financial market risk as well as from credit risk. Key drivers of financial market risk are credit spread and equity risk. Credit risk is mainly driven by the credit and surety business and default risk on capital market products.\n\nTotal risk is based on 99% tail value-atrisk (tail VaR) and represents the average unexpected loss that occurs with a frequency of less than once in 100 years over a one-year time horizon.\n\nTotal risk increased to USD 22.7 billion driven by higher financial market risk, partially offset by lower insurance risk.

The effect of diversification at the category level, which is shown in the table above, represents the difference between total risk (the Group's 99% tail VaR) and the sum of standalone tail VaR amounts for the individual risk categories. This amount does not reflect diversification within risk categories. The extent of diversification is largely determined by the selected level of aggregation - the higher the aggregation level, the lower the diversification effect.\n\n## Alternative risk measurements for Swiss Re Group\n\n| USD billions   |   SST 2021 |   SST 2022 | Change in %   |\n|----------------|------------|------------|---------------|\n| 99% VaR 1      |       17.2 |       17.4 | 1%            |\n| 99.5% VaR 1    |       20.1 |       20.4 | 2%            |\n\nAlternative risk measurements - 99% and 99.5% VaR - increase to USD 17.4 billion and USD 20.4 billion, respectively.",

It includes underlying risks inherent in the business Swiss Re underwrites, such as inflation or uncertainty in pricing and reserving.\n- \u00b7 Life and health insurance risk arises from coverage provided for mortality (death), longevity (annuity) and morbidity (illness and disability). In addition to potential shock events (such as a severe pandemic), it includes underlying risks inherent in life and health contracts that arise when mortality, morbidity, or lapse experience deviates from expectations.\n- \u00b7 Financial market risk represents the potential impact on assets or liabilities that may arise from movements in financial market prices or rates, such as equity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, hedge fund prices, real estate prices, commodity prices or foreign exchange rates. Financial market risk originates from two main sources: investment activities and the sensitivity of the economic value of liabilities to financial market fluctuations.\n- \u00b7 Credit risk reflects the potential financial loss that may arise due to diminished creditworthiness or default of counterparties of Swiss Re or of third parties; credit risk arises from investment and treasury activities, structured transactions and retrocession, as well as from liabilities underwritten by credit and surety insurance units.\n\n## L i f e  & H e a l t h\n\n- \u00b7 Lethal pandemic\n- \u00b7 Mortality trend\n- \u00b7 Longevity\n- \u00b7 Critical illness\n- \u00b7 Income protection\n- \u00b7 Lapse\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Financial market\n\n- \u00b7 Credit spread\n- \u00b7 Equity\n- \u00b7 Foreign exchange\n- \u00b7 FM inflation\n- \u00b7 Interest rate\n- \u00b7 Real estate\n\n## Other significant risks\n\n## Emerging risks",

Swiss Re has implemented a capital model for operational risk, which is used for Solvency II purposes.\n- \u00b7 Strategic risk represents the possibility that poor strategic decision-making, execution or response to industry changes or competitor actions could harm Swiss Re's competitive position and thus its franchise value.\n- \u00b7 Regulatory risk arises from changes to insurance regulations and supervisory regimes as well as from interactions with regulatory authorities and supervisory regimes of the jurisdictions in which Swiss Re operates.\n- \u00b7 Political risk comprises the consequences of political events or actions that could have an adverse impact on Swiss Re's business or operations.\n- \u00b7 Model risk reflects the potential impact of model errors or the inappropriate use of model outputs. It may arise from data errors or limitations, operational or simulation errors, or limitations in model specification, calibration or implementation; model risk may also be caused by insufficient knowledge of the model and its limitations, in particular by management and other decision-makers.\n- \u00b7 Valuation risk represents uncertainty around the appropriate value of assets or liabilities. It may arise from product complexity, parameter uncertainty, quality and consistency of data, valuation methodology, or changes in market conditions and liquidity. Swiss Re is exposed to financial valuation risk from investment assets it holds as well as reserve valuation risk from insurance liabilities that result from the coverage it underwrites.\n- \u00b7 Sustainability risk comprises the environmental, social and governance risks that may arise from individual business transactions or the way Swiss Re conducts its operations.\n- \u00b7 Across all risk categories, Swiss Re actively identifies emerging risks and threats as part of its risk identification process; this includes new risks as well as changes to previously known risks that could create new risk exposures, or increase the potential exposure or interdependency between existing risks.\n- \u00b7 Some of these risks are reflected indirectly in the risk model, as their realisations may be contained in the historical data and scenarios used to calibrate some of the risk factors.

        "page_content": "## Management of other significant risks\n\n## Operational risk\n\nThe Group has implemented an internal control system to mitigate operational risks through three lines of control. This system assigns primary responsibility for identifying and managing operational risks to individual risk takers (first line of control), with independent oversight and control by the Risk Management and Compliance functions (second line of control) as well as Group Internal Audit (third line of control). Members of the Group Executive Committee are required to certify the effectiveness of the internal control system for their area of responsibility on a quarterly basis.\n\nOperational risk is inherent within Swiss Re's business processes. As the company does not receive an explicit financial return for such risks, the approach to managing operational risk differs from the approach applied to other risk categories. The purpose of operational risk management is not to eliminate risks but rather to identify and cost-effectively mitigate operational risks that approach or exceed Swiss Re's tolerance.\n\nRisk Management is responsible for monitoring and controlling operational risks based on a centrally coordinated methodology. This includes a pre-defined taxonomy that is used for identifying, classifying and reporting operational risks, as well as a matrix in which risks are assessed according to their estimated probability and impact. Risks are assessed for their residual economic, financial reporting, reputational and compliance impact, taking into account existing mitigation and controls.\n\nThe matrix is also used to assess residual exposures against Swiss Re's internal tolerance limits for operational risk. This limit represents the level of operational risk that the Board of Directors and executive management teams are willing to accept. Material risks that exceed or are approaching risk tolerance are reported to executive management and Boards of Directors at Group and legal entity level.\n\nIn addition, mitigation strategies are required for all risks that are outside of operational risk limits in order to bring them within tolerance.\n\nCyber risk and information security are a key focus of Swiss Re's operational risk controls. The Group performs an annual cyber risk assessment to determine the current maturity of controls; this is based on internationally recognised standards defined by the Information Security Forum. The results of the assessment are shared with senior management and integrated into Swiss Re's Group-wide cybersecurity programme. This programme focuses on five key areas: security culture, critical information, technology defence, incident response and supplier governance.\n\nOperational events and issues are recorded and managed in a central Operational Risk Management system in order to address the identified problems and avoid the recurrence of similar events. The results are reviewed by the relevant CRO and reported to the company's management team and Board of Directors.\n\nSwiss Re has adapted to increased remote working without any significant increase in operational or compliance failings as a result of this change in operating model. Strong communication and collaboration across teams, and between business and risk functions, continues to assure an adequate level of operational resilience is maintained.\n\n## Strategic risk\n\nOverall responsibility for managing strategic risk lies with the Group Board, which establishes Swiss Re's overall strategy. The Boards of legal entities are responsible for the strategic risk inherent in their specific strategy development and execution. Strategic risks are addressed by examining multi-year scenarios, considering the related risks, as well as monitoring the implementation of the chosen strategy year-by-year in terms of the annual business plan.\n\nAs part of their independent oversight role, Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit are responsible for controlling the risk-taking arising from the implementation of the strategy.\n\n## Model risk\n\nSwiss Re uses models throughout its business processes and operations, in particular to price insurance products, value financial assets and liabilities, assess reserves and portfolio cash flows, and estimate risk and capital requirements.\n\nModel owners have primary responsibility for model-related risks and are required to adhere to a robust tool development process, including testing, peer review, documentation and sign-off. A similar process also applies to model maintenance.\n\nSwiss Re's model governance is based on Group-wide standards for model assurance. These standards seek to ensure that each model has a clear scope, is based on sound mathematical and scientific concepts, has been implemented correctly and produces appropriate results given the stated purpose. Furthermore, the calibration of model parameters (and the data on which the calibration relies) must be trustworthy, while expert judgments are required to be sensible, documented and evidenced.\n\nAnalytical or financial models that are used for costing, valuation and risk capital calculations are governed by Swiss Re's Model and Tool Assurance Framework. Material models used for costing, valuation of reserves and assets as well as Swiss Re's internal risk model are validated by dedicated teams within Risk Management. These teams provide independent assurance that the framework has been adhered to, and also conduct independent validations. Swiss Re's internal risk model is also subject to regulatory scrutiny.\n\nModel-related incidents are captured within Swiss Re's operational risk framework. In addition, material model developments, incidents and risks are reported in regular risk updates to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level.\n\n## Valuation risk\n\nFinancial valuation risk is managed by internal and external portfolio managers, who ensure that valuations remain in line with the market. In addition, Swiss Re has a function within Financial Risk Management that independently assesses valuations and valuation techniques; this team performs",

The results of the independent price verification process are reviewed by the Asset Valuation Committee. Summary results are regularly reported to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.\n\nReserve valuation risk is managed by Swiss Re's Actuarial Control function, with dedicated teams for property and casualty, and life and health valuation. These teams ensure that Swiss Re's reserve-setting process uses an appropriate governance framework, including defined accountabilities and decision-making processes for risk takers (as the first line of control) as well as for Actuarial Control. The framework ensures that there is independent assurance on the data, assumptions, models and processes used for valuation purposes; for all property and casualty business and selected life and health portfolios, it also includes an independent assessment of the reserves to ensure that their level remains within a range of possible best estimates. Regular deep-dive investigations are performed into selected portfolios in order to review the appropriateness of both the reserves and the applied reserving approach. In addition, Swiss Re's external auditor conducts quarterly reviews as well as a comprehensive year-end audit of controls, methodology and results.\n\n## Regulatory risk\n\nRegulatory developments and related risks that may affect Swiss Re and its subsidiaries or branches are identified, assessed and monitored as part of regular oversight activities. Swiss Re is actively engaged in a dialogue with relevant regulators to improve mutual understanding of the implications arising from new regulatory proposals. Periodic reports and recommendations on regulatory issues are provided to executive management and the Board of Directors at Group and legal entity level.\n\nThe regulatory environment of the insurance industry continues to evolve on the national, regional and international level. While some regulatory changes create new business opportunities, others come with significant costs and business restrictions. Growing regulatory complexity, increased national protectionism and a fragile global economy are persistent themes affecting regulation and the way Swiss Re operates worldwide.\n\nRegulatory efforts are becoming increasingly forward-looking, aimed at a broad range of emerging risks, both actual and perceived. If new regulation is not based on clearly understood risks with a view to materiality, and if the resulting requirements are not harmonised with international standards and best practices, this may create an excessive burden for both insurers and policyholders. It remains a key priority for Swiss Re to highlight the negative impacts of market access restrictions or impediments to global diversification towards regulators. At the same time, such risks are mitigated by seeking solutions that reduce the negative impact on Swiss Re and its clients.\n\nThere is ongoing regulatory attention on enhancing sustainability disclosure. Forward-looking climate risk assessments - such as scenario analyses or stress testing - are gaining traction. These regulatory initiatives differ in scope, methodology and key assumptions. Swiss Re supports such measures and continues to advocate for a harmonised and gradual implementation of these requirements in line with international standards and recommendations, such as those of the Financial Stability Board Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Swiss Re continues in its efforts to discourage regulatory fragmentation and ensure that requirements are appropriate.\n\nSwiss Re consistently advocates the removal or reduction of market access barriers, so that policyholders, governments, taxpayers and national economies can fully benefit from international diversification and therefore from reliable, sound and affordable risk cover and transfer.\n\nWith markets more stable following the pandemic shock, supervisors, regulators, standard-setters and other actors have\n\nsignificantly ramped up efforts in the digital policy space. COVID-19 has accelerated discussions around operational resilience, cybersecurity rules and third-party provider concentration risks. Swiss Re follows these topics closely and monitors their potential impact.\n\n## Political risk\n\nPolitical developments can threaten Swiss Re's operating model but also open up opportunities for developing the business. The Group adopts a holistic view of political risk and analyses developments in individual markets and jurisdictions, as well as cross-border issues such as war, terrorism, energy-related issues and international trade controls.\n\nDedicated political risk analysts identify, monitor, and assess political developments across the world. Swiss Re's political risk experts also exercise oversight and control functions for named political risks, such as in the political risk insurance business; this includes monitoring political risk exposures, providing recommendations on particular transaction referrals and risk reporting. In addition, the Political Risk team provides specific country ratings and qualitative assessments that cover political, economic and security-related country risks; these assessments complement sovereign credit ratings and are used to support risk control activities and inform underwriting or other decision-making processes throughout the Group.\n\nIn addition to identifying and assessing the impact of political risk on its business, the Group seeks to raise awareness of political risk issues within the industry and among the broader public, through active dialogue with clients, the media and other stakeholders. The Group also builds relationships that expand its access to information and intelligence, and allow Swiss Re to further enhance its methodologies and standards. For example, Swiss Re participates in specialist events hosted by institutions such as industry and risk management associations, and maintains relationships with political risk specialists in other industries, think tanks and universities, as well as with governmental and non-governmental organisations.",

Following the UK's exit from the EU, one of Swiss Re's UK branches is authorised as a third-country branch by the UK's regulators, the Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority. The other two UK branches are operating under the UK's Temporary Permissions Regime which, subject to certain conditions, allows third country branches to conduct insurance and reinsurance business in the UK until licences are granted by UK regulators.\n\nApplications for licenses for these two third country branches have been submitted and Swiss Re is in regular contact with the UK's Prudential Regulatory Authority and Financial Conduct Authority to progress these applications.\n\n## Sustainability risk\n\nSwiss Re's continued business success depends on the successful management of sustainability risks, thus helping to maintain the trust of its stakeholders. The Group has a long-standing commitment to sustainable business practices, active corporate citizenship, as well as good, transparent governance. All employees are required to commit to and comply with Swiss Re's values and sustainability policies.\n\nPotential sustainability risks are mitigated through clear corporate values, active dialogue and engagement with affected external stakeholders, and robust internal controls. These include a Group-wide Sustainability Risk Framework to identify and address sustainability risks across Swiss Re's business activities. The framework comprises sustainability-related policies - with pre-defined exclusions, underwriting criteria and quality standards - as well as a central due diligence process for related transactional risks.\n\nSustainability risks are monitored and managed by dedicated experts in Swiss Re's Group Sustainability Risk team, which is also responsible for maintaining the Sustainability Risk Framework. In addition, this unit supports Swiss Re's management and business strategy through tailored risk assessments and risk portfolio reviews. It fosters risk awareness through internal training and facilitates development of innovative solutions to address sustainability\n\nissues. Finally, it represents and advocates Swiss Re's position on selected sustainability risk topics to external stakeholders.\n\nSwiss Re is a founding signatory to the UN Principles for Sustainable Insurance (UN PSI) and is currently a board member of this initiative. The UN PSI provide a global framework for managing environmental, social and governance challenges. Swiss Re has been actively contributing to the initiative for several years.\n\nAs a signatory to the Paris Pledge for Action and the UN Global Compact Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, Swiss Re is supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy and is committed to achieving net-zero emissions for its insurance and investment portfolios by 2050, as well as for own operations by 2030.\n\nTo support this ambitious goal, Swiss Re launched in 2021 the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance as a founding member. The CEOs of the founding members also joined the COP26 Race to Zero campaign and became part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ), bringing together existing and new net-zero finance initiatives into one sector-wide strategic forum. Swiss Re's CEO also co-chairs the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, the largest such alliance in the world committed to delivering concrete climate solutions and innovations.\n\nOther important steps to achieve the net-zero target are the updated Thermal Coal and Oil & Gas policies. In 2021, Swiss Re extended the Thermal Coal Policy to treaty business. The updated policy introduces specific exposure thresholds effective from 2023 and sets a long-term reduction path to reach a total phase-out of thermal coal by 2030 for OECD countries and by 2040 for the rest of the world. In July 2021, the updated Oil & Gas policy entered into force, excluding the world's 5% most carbon-intense oil and gas companies.\n\nSwiss Re has joined the Taskforce on Nature Related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) which was launched in June 2021. The industry-led initiative aims to replicate the success of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD), with the goal to provide a framework for organisations to report on evolving nature and biodiversity-related risks.\n\nReflecting the Group's strong overall commitment to sustainability, Swiss Re continued to be included in leading sustainability indexes and rankings such as FTSE4Good, Euronext Vigeo World 120, Ethibel Excellence Global, Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index, ISS ESG Prime and ISS QualityScore and the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. For more information on Swiss Re's sustainability practices, see the 2021 Sustainability Report.\n\n## Emerging risk\n\nAnticipating possible developments in the risk landscape is a central element of Enterprise Risk Management. Swiss Re promotes pre-emptive thinking on risk in all areas of the business in order to reduce uncertainty and diminish the volatility of the Group's results, while also identifying new business opportunities and raising awareness for emerging risks.\n\nFor this purpose, Swiss Re's risk identification processes are supported by a systematic framework that identifies, assesses and monitors emerging risks and opportunities across all areas of Swiss Re's risk landscape. This framework combines a bottom-up approach driven by employee input with central and regional experts on emerging risk. The resulting information is complemented with insights from external organisations such as think tanks, academic networks and international organisations, as well as from interaction with clients.\n\nFindings are reported to management and internal stakeholders, including a prioritised overview of newly identified emerging risks and an estimate of their potential impact on Swiss Re's business. Swiss Re also publishes an annual emerging risk report (Swiss Re SONAR) to raise awareness within the Group and across the industry and initiate a risk dialogue with key external stakeholders.\n\nTo advance risk awareness across the industry and beyond, Swiss Re maintains regular exchanges on emerging risks with its clients and continues to participate actively in strategic risk initiatives such as the CRO Forum's Emerging Risk Initiative and the International Risk Governance Council.\n\nThe following emerging risks are deemed particularly important for Swiss Re's business:",

        "page_content": "## Mental health\n\nIn recent years, the number of people diagnosed with mental health issues has been rising, and so have related healthcare costs and disability claims. Severe depression is of particular concern due to the risk of causing inability to work, higher suicide rates and increased likelihood for physical health impairment. As the contribution of depression to the global 'burden of disease' increases, greater attention is being given to the potential progression from risk triggers and mild symptoms to severe states.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nFor insurers and reinsurers, there are direct implications, particularly for disability claims and cases of early mortality. If conditions remain untreated, affected individuals may develop more severe health problems later in life such as cardiovascular diseases, back pain and diabetes. Preventing mental illness from developing or escalating can thus not only improve personal wellbeing, but also significantly reduce healthcare costs. For the insurance industry, challenges around offering adequate protection for mental health vulnerabilities are as much in focus as preventive measures.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re advocates de-stigmatisation as key to tackling mental health issues, favouring prevention, early intervention, and continuous mental wellbeing management. Swiss Re has partnered with an innovative mental health platform to create an insurance-specific app to help policyholders better track their mental wellbeing and improve links to insurers' support networks, such as therapy providers or employee assistance programmes.\n\nSwiss Re's Life & Health medical underwriting manual (Life Guide) includes support for insurers' assessment of mental health conditions. The manual embraces a holistic and inclusive approach and offers guidance on emerging risk factors like burnout and work-related stress.\n\nTo raise awareness, Swiss Re Institute has been issuing publications on mental health risks. To support the wellbeing of Swiss Re's own employees, a mental health network is maintained internally, supported by awareness campaigns.\n\n## Climate change - Moving to a low-carbon future\n\nTo meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement, global warming needs to stay well below 2\u02daC compared to pre-industrial levels. To achieve this, the target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. A rapid transition to a low carbon economy is required. The changes are needed across all industries and entail an entire cluster of new risks which need to be understood, assessed and mitigated. Swiss Re, and the insurance industry in general, regularly assesses the changing risk landscape and can help accelerate this transition through risk transfer products and as a long-term investor.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nThe insurance sector is exposed to transition risks which may arise as a result of policy, legal, technology and market changes that are required to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy. For insurers and reinsurers, investment risks arising from this transition are mainly linked to the potential re-pricing of carbonintensive financial assets, and the speed at which any such re-pricing might occur.\n\nTo a lesser extent, insurers and reinsurers may also need to adapt to potential impacts on insurance resulting from, for example, reductions in insurance premium volumes from carbon-intensive sectors or coverage of new technologies without established loss histories, which may increase uncertainties in lines of business such as property and engineering.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re is taking proactive measures to reduce potential business impacts on its investment and insurance portfolios, for example, reducing exposure to assets with the potential to be stranded in carbonintense energy infrastructure. Swiss Re is phasing out thermal coal in its investment portfolio by 2030 and for underwriting in OECD countries by 2030 and in the rest of the world by 2040. As a leader in the underwriting of renewable energy risk, Swiss Re is actively adapting existing products, as well as developing new risk transfer solutions. A new focus area for the future will be the risk cluster related to innovations in carbon removal which will be an integral part of reaching net zero.\n\n## Reliability of energy supplies\n\nLong-lasting outage or deficiency of energy supplies can be triggered by natural catastrophes (eg solar storms), network volatility (eg through volatile renewable energy sources such as wind and solar) and intentional (eg cyber attack or political events) or unintentional man-made events from technical or human failure. These can lead to potentially accumulating disruptions of electric power, gas, or oil distribution systems. Energy supply disruptions become more likely as energy distribution systems are increasingly operating at capacity and inconsistently maintained. In addition, the complexity, diversity and interdependency of energy supplies is increasing.\n\n## Potential business impact\n\nA prolonged large-scale disruption of energy supplies can lead to widespread property damage, business interruption, financial market impacts and operational challenges. Importantly, it is likely that business impacts increase non-linearly the longer blackouts last. This could lead to substantial economic losses. Exposure for the insurance industry could be significant, though many of these risks remain uninsured.\n\n## Mitigation measures\n\nSwiss Re actively addresses prolonged energy supply disruption risk through scenario assessments of the potential business impact. As an example of such an assessment, Swiss Re considered direct and indirect underwriting loss potentials from a long-duration power blackout in the US triggered by a solar storm.\n\nSwiss Re maintains a risk dialogue with governmental bodies, power suppliers and other stakeholders to discuss energy supply disruption risk and potential mitigation measures. Considerations include preventive measures, possibilities for public-private partnerships to create insurance pool solutions and other approaches to improve resilience. Given that future energy storage technologies will play an important role as a risk mitigant, Swiss Re is engaging in raising awareness of this risk cluster through the CRO Forum Emerging Risk Initiative.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor more information about emerging risk, see the Swiss Re SONAR report.",

Ermotti\n\nChairman of the Board of Directors\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Overview\n\n## Corporate governance trends\n\nSwiss Re closely monitors corporate governance developments and trends globally and adapts its corporate governance accordingly. Swiss Re is convinced that solid, efficient and fit for purpose corporate governance is key for success.\n\nIn 2021, several trends have come to the forefront on the social agenda. The ongoing global pandemic is clearly paramount. There is also a greater call from all levels of society for large corporations to justify their overall social and economic purpose. These trends are forcing companies and their leaders to rearticulate their values, strategy, board role and management actions.\n\nOver the past years, there has been a much greater focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, in particular on climate, diversity and inclusion. The focus on ESG is leading to increasing momentum towards greater transparency in corporate reporting and board level accountability, particularly in proactively addressing ESG issues and managing the associated risks.\n\nDemonstrating leadership in these areas can be a differentiating factor.\n\nSwiss Re is one of the industry leaders in ESG areas. In 2021, the Group continued to implement the Group Sustainability Strategy, with a focus on reinforcing Swiss Re's efforts to make the world more resilient and sustainable. From a corporate governance perspective, Swiss Re has established a well-defined governance framework to guide how to implement, enhance and monitor the Group Sustainability Strategy.\n\nPages 83-85 provide more information on Swiss Re's governance approach to ESG.",

Ermotti as the new Chairman of the Board of Directors. Mr Ermotti is a non-executive and independent Chairman. He was initially elected to the Board of Directors in 2020.\n\n## Board of Directors composition\n\nWalter B. Kielholz resigned as Chairman and a member of the Board of Directors effective as of the AGM 2021. The AGM re-elected all other Board members. There were no further changes to the Board composition during 2021.\n\n## Group Executive Committee (Group EC)\n\nOn 1 July 2021, Cathy Desquesses was appointed Group Chief Human Resources Officer (Group CHRO) and a member of the Group EC, succeeding Nigel Fretwell, who had retired on 30 June 2021. Anette Bronder, former Group Chief Operating Officer (Group COO), stepped down from the Group EC on 17 December 2021 and left Swiss Re.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, Pravina Ladva was appointed Group Chief Digital & Technology Officer (Group CDTO) and a member of the Group EC.\n\nPaul Murray was appointed CEO Reinsurance Asia and Regional President Asia and a member of the Group EC, effective 1 April 2022. He succeeds Russell Higginbotham, who has been appointed CEO Reinsurance Solutions.\n\nEffective 1 January 2022, Group Operations has been reorganised: the Group EC no longer comprises a Group COO role. Corporate Services (CS) have been assigned to the responsibility of the Group CHRO (newly: Group CHRO & Head CS), and Digital & Technology to the Group CDTO.\n\n## Governance structure and organisation New Governance and\n\n## Nomination Committee\n\nAt the end of October 2021, the Board of Directors simplified its governance by disbanding both the Chairman's and Governance Committee and the Nomination Committee by replacing them with the new Governance and Nomination Committee. This Committee, chaired by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, addresses corporate governance matters, reviews environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics and ensures that they are embedded at all levels in the Group. It also supports the Board of Directors with the succession planning at both Board and Group EC level.\n\n## Simplification of the Group's legal entity structure\n\nOn 25 September 2020, Swiss Re announced a further streamlining of the Group's governance structure with the aim to pool the business and risks across all Business Units/Division iptiQ to increase the Group's capital efficiency while keeping accountability and responsibilities intact. Effective 1 July 2021, Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd (SRZ) has become the main direct wholly owned operating subsidiary of Swiss Re Ltd. SRZ in turn holds separate holding companies for the Business Units Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions, as well as for the Division iptiQ. Under the new structure, the Group EC also assumes management responsibility for SRZ. It is supported by the new Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO) and the new Group Underwriting Committee (GUC).\n\n## Outlook for 2022\n\n## Board succession planning\n\nRemoval of the implicit age limit\n\nThe implicit age limit of 70 years for Board membership will be removed in order to avoid age discrimination. This also allows for the best talents to be attracted and retained for the Board of Directors going forward. The implicit age limit will no longer be applied in the Board succession planning process.\n\n## Introduction of 12-year tenure limit\n\nThe Board of Directors will propose an amendment to the Articles of Association at the AGM 2022 to introduce a 12-year tenure limit, applicable for all current and new Board members, as of the AGM 2022.\n\n## Gender diversity\n\nDiversity - and in particular gender diversity - is of the utmost importance to the Board of Directors for its composition. Therefore, gender diversity is a top priority for new appointments. At the AGM 2022, the Board of Directors will provide a formal commitment to reach female representation at the Board level of 30% or more by the AGM 2023.\n\n## Nominations Chairman and Board of Directors\n\nIn line with the newly proposed tenure limit, Raymond K.F. Ch'ien will not stand for re-election at the AGM 2022. The Board of Directors proposes the Chairman as well as all remaining Board members for re-election at the AGM 2022.\n\n## Board of Directors and Group EC compensation\n\nPlease refer to the Compensation Report beginning on page 118 of this Financial Report for information on compensation of and shareholding and Group EC members (including authorities and procedures for determining the same, pages\n\n125-126) as well as for loans granted to them (pages 129 and 136) and for relating to these matters (page 125).\n\nprogrammes for the Board of Directors provisions of the Articles of Association",

These engagements involve regular discussions with Swiss Re's technical experts and business leaders on\n\nsustainability-related matters.\n\nA well-established example of such engagement is the annual Chairman roadshow, which Swiss Re has been undertaking for many years. The Chairman meets major shareholders to discuss - in addition to the Group's strategy and financial performance Swiss Re's sustainability approach and to engage on corporate governance topics including Board composition, diversity, tenure and independence as well as on the compensation framework.

It was divided into 317 497 306 registered shares, each with a par value of CHF 0.10. The share capital remained unchanged during 2021.\n\n## Conditional and authorised capital in particular\n\nUnder Swiss company law, the shareholders' meeting approves the creation of conditional or authorised capital. At the AGM on 16 April 2021, shareholders approved the renewal of the authorised capital for another two years. No shares were issued out of conditional capital during 2021.\n\nFor more information on the conditional and authorised capital, please refer to the Articles of Association (Articles 3a, 3b).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Articles of Association\n\nwww.swissre.com/articles\n\nFor information on the renewal of and changes to the authorised capital and to the conditional capital, approved by the shareholders at the AGM 2021, please refer to the AGM invitation (agenda item 7).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## AGM invitation\n\nwww.swissre.com/agm2021\n\nFor information on changes to the share capital for earlier years, please refer to the Corporate Governance Chapter of the Annual Reports of these years.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Transferability and nominee registrations\n\nSwiss Re Ltd does not restrict or limit the transferability of its shares. Upon demand, shareholders are recorded in the share register with the right to vote, if they provide evidence of the acquisition of the shares as well as a declaration that they have acquired the shares in their name and for their own account and are compliant with shareholding disclosure obligations. Any shareholder so entered in the share register with the right to vote can exercise voting rights without any limitation. Swiss Re Ltd applies special provisions for the registration of nominees. Nominees are entered in the share register with voting rights up to a maximum of 2% of the issued Swiss Re Ltd shares, without any further inquiry. For holdings above that threshold, nominees are only registered with voting rights, if they disclose the names, addresses and shareholdings of any persons for whom the nominees are holding 0.5% or more of the issued Swiss Re Ltd shares. A group clause applies with respect to the nominee rules. The Articles of Association do not provide for exceptions, and no exceptions have been granted in 2021. The Board of Directors can strike a shareholder with voting rights off the share register retroactively, if the entry was obtained under false pretences, or in the case of breach of disclosure rules (as more fully set out in Article 4 of the Articles of Association). The restrictions on nominee registrations could be abolished by way of a shareholders' resolution requiring the absolute majority of the votes validly cast at a Shareholders' meeting.\n\n## All reports and further documents\n\nwww.swissre.com/financialinformation\n\n|                                         | 31 December 2020   | 31 December 2020            | 31 December 2020   | 31 December 2021   | 31 December 2021            | 31 December 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------|\n|                                         | Capital in CHF     | In % of the   share capital | Shares             | Capital in CHF     | In % of the   share capital | Shares             |\n| Shares                                  |                    |                             |                    |                    |                             |                    |\n| Share capital                           | 31 749 730.60      | 100%                        | 317 497 306        | 31 749 730.60      | 100%                        | 317 497 306        |\n| Conditional capital                     |                    |                             |                    |                    |                             |                    |\n| for Equity-Linked Financing Instruments | 5 000 000.00       | 15.74%                      | 50 000 000         | 5 000 000.00       | 15.74%                      | 50 000 000         |\n| Authorised capital                      | 8 500 000.00       | 26.77%                      | 85 000 000         | 8 500 000.00       | 26.77%                      | 85 000 000         |\n\n## Shares\n\nAll Swiss Re Ltd shares are fully paid-in registered shares (Namenaktien), each share with a par value of CHF 0.10.

It elects a Vice Chairman and a Lead Independent Director among its independent members. The same member can have both roles. The Board of Directors also elects the chairpersons and members of the Board committees (other than the members of the Compensation Committee who are elected by the AGM). It is the Governance and Nomination Committee which prepares these proposals. The Board of Directors appoints its secretary, who is also the secretary to the Board committees with the exception of the Compensation Committee. The Global Head Reward is the secretary of the Compensation Committee. In line with the Bylaws, the Board of Directors meets at the invitation of the Chairman, as often as business requires but not fewer than six times a year.\n\nThe tables on the next page provide an overview of the meetings of the Board of Directors and Board committees in 2021 and show the overall and individual meeting attendance of the Board members.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nwww.swissre.com/bylaws\n\n## Allocation of tasks within the Board of Directors\n\n## Chairman\n\nThe Chairman leads the Board of Directors, convenes the Board and committee meetings, establishes the agendas and presides over Board meetings. The Chairman coordinates the work of the Board committees together with the respective chairpersons and ensures that the Board is kept informed about the committees' activities and findings. The Chairman maintains a sound working relationship with the Group CEO and further Group EC members. He presides over shareholders' meetings and represents the Group, alongside the Group CEO, towards its shareholders, in industry associations and in the interaction with other stakeholders such as the media, political and regulatory authorities, governmental officials and the general public. Specifically, the Chairman keeps regular contact with the Group's regulator FINMA.\n\n## Vice Chairman\n\nThe Vice Chairman deputises for the Chairman if the Chairman cannot perform his duties or in a potential conflict-of-interest situation. The Vice Chairman may prepare and execute Board resolutions at the request of the Board and liaises between the Board and the Group EC in matters not reserved to the Chairman.\n\n## Lead Independent Director\n\nThe Vice Chairman or another member of the Board of Directors assumes the role of the Lead Independent Director. He acts as an intermediary between the Group and its shareholders and stakeholders in the absence of the Chairman or, in particular, when a senior independent member of the Board is required. He may convene and chair sessions of the Board of Directors where the Chairman is not present. He communicates the outcome of these sessions to the Chairman.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAllocation of tasks within the Board of Directors\n\nwww.swissre.com/boardlead\n\n## Board committees\n\nThe Board of Directors has delegated certain responsibilities to five Board committees. Depending on the responsibility, the Board committees have decision-making powers or act in an advisory capacity. The committees work on the basis of a charter, which forms part of the Bylaws. Each committee provides a report on its activities, proposals and recommendations following a committee meeting at the next meeting of the Board. If any significant topic emerges, the committees contact the Board of Directors immediately. It is the responsibility of each committee to keep the Board of Directors informed in a timely manner. Please refer to pages 100-101 for an overview of the Board committees' responsibilities, members and key focus areas in 2021. For further information on the Board committees please refer to the committee charters in the Bylaws or to the Swiss Re website:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board committees\n\nwww.swissre.com/boardcommittees\n\n## Board of Directors and Group EC: Separate responsibilities\n\nThe Board of Directors has non-delegable duties which rest with the entire Board. It decides, among other topics, on the strategy of Swiss Re and supervises compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. For an overview on the key responsibilities of the Board of Directors please refer to the Swiss Re website.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Board responsibilities\n\nwww.swissre.com/boardresponsibilities\n\nThe Group EC is responsible for the management of Swiss Re Ltd and the Group as delegated by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors supervises the Group EC (please refer to page 103 for further information).\n\nThe Bylaws clearly allocate responsibilities to each of the Board of Directors, the Board committees, the Group EC, the Group CEO and individual Group EC members.\n\nPlease refer to the Bylaws for further information on the working methods of the Board and its committees, in particular with regards to convening meetings and invitation, resolutions and quorum as well as on the allocation of responsibilities.",

The Board is convinced that a diverse composition is indispensable for a successful and efficient fulfilment of its responsibilities. The principles of gender and age diversity, inclusion, diversity of nationality, race and ethnicity, regional representation, transparency and the avoidance of conflicts of interest therefore play an important role in the composition of the Board of Directors.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Independence\n\nThe Bylaws require that at least threequarters of the Board members are independent. Swiss Re defines independence in line with best practice corporate governance standards. All Board members meet the independence criteria. For further details please refer to the Bylaws (Article 3.2). No Board member has ever held a management position within the Group or has or represents a company or organisation which has any significant business connections with Swiss Re, other than as disclosed in Note 19 to the Group financial statements on page 291 of this Financial Report.\n\nThe members of the Board of Directors are also subject to procedures to avoid any action, position or interest that conflicts with an interest of Swiss Re or gives the appearance of a conflict. For details on the procedures please refer to the Bylaws (Article 20.2).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Bylaws\n\nwww.swissre.com/bylaws\n\n## Board member qualifications\n\nThe Board of Directors ensures for its composition that the necessary qualifications and skills are represented among its members to fulfil its oversight responsibility and enable a sound and independent decision-making. The Board aims to assemble a balance of knowledge in various key areas as well as managerial expertise. The mandate also demands significant commitment and availability.\n\n## Succession planning\n\nThe Governance and Nomination Committee supports the Board of Directors with the succession planning at both Board and Group EC level. It regularly reviews the qualifications and skills represented in the Board and aligns them with best practice developments, stakeholder demands and changing business needs. It submits recommendations to the Board of Directors, which decides on the selection criteria used to assess potential candidates for Board membership. The Governance and Nomination Committee initiates the evaluation of potential new Board members in a timely manner with the continued aim to ensure the Board members have the desired expertise and experience as well as with a particular focus on gender diversity. The Governance and Nomination Committee submits recommendations to the Board of Directors for new Board members. It is the Board which nominates candidates for Board membership for election and re-election by the AGM. It ensures that the Board retains an adequate size and well-balanced composition. Regional representation 5 Americas 3 EMEA 3 Switzerland 2 Asia\n\n## Self-assessment\n\nAn open, transparent and critical board room culture forms the basis for the Board of Directors' annual review of its own performance and effectiveness. The Board of Directors evaluates its work and the performance of the Chairman. It conducts the self-assessment on the basis of questionnaires, which deal with the Board's composition, organisation and processes, the Board's responsibilities, accomplishments as well as the focus areas and goals of the year under review. The Board discusses these topics and defines take-aways which are incorporated in the goals for the upcoming year. In addition, each Board committee annually conducts a self-assessment along the same lines. The Board also incorporates these findings in its succession planning process as outlined on the left.\n\n## Board members' training\n\nIn an ever-changing world, keeping abreast of new developments and advancing knowledge is key for the Board of Directors. Educational sessions and deep dives form an integral part of the Board's agenda each year. Each Board member also has the opportunity to have 1-1 sessions with key executives and experts on specific topics of interest and value. In 2021, the Board focused on learning more about the capital and funding framework and related developments including evaluating alternative capital solutions, as well as gaining insights into the P&C reserving methodology around large losses. The onboarding programme for new Board members is an established set of training and materials aimed at ensuring that incoming Board members have a comprehensive overview of the Group's organisation, business and environment.\n\n## Board of Directors skills and competencies*\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n- *  This overview represents the skills, expertise and experience considered most critical for Swiss Re's Board of Directors.",

        "page_content": "## Shareholders' participation rights\n\nThe shareholders elect the Independent Proxy which represents their votes.\n\n## Voting rights, restrictions\n\nSwiss Re Ltd does not have any voting rights restrictions in place (other than the limitations on nominee registrations as set out on page 88). One share entitles to one vote. However, shareholders are entitled to exercise their voting rights only for shares which have been registered in the share register no later than four working days before the shareholders' meeting.\n\n## Registration in the share register\n\nIn order to be registered, a shareholder generally must declare that he or she acquired the Swiss Re Ltd shares in his or her own name and for his or her own account (see page 88). Swiss Re Ltd's share register is an internal, non-public register which is subject to confidentiality and data privacy regulations.\n\n## Representation\n\nEach shareholder registered with voting rights is allowed to participate at shareholders' meetings. If the shareholder does not wish to attend personally, he or she may have the shares represented at the shareholders' meetings by another person authorised in writing or by the Independent Proxy. The Independent Proxy is elected by the AGM for a term of office until completion of the following AGM. For the purpose of representation, the shareholder can issue voting instructions for each of the agenda items. The shareholder also has the option to give instructions electronically via the Sherpany platform. Such votes are also represented by the Independent Proxy.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Shareholders' meetings\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2021\n\nThe AGM 2021 of Swiss Re Ltd took place on the basis of the provisions of the Swiss Federal Council's Ordinance 3 on Measures to Combat the Coronavirus (COVID-19 Ordinance 3). As a result, shareholders could not attend the AGM in person. Shareholders were able to exercise their right to vote (including on elections) indirectly, via representation by the Independent Proxy. Following the AGM, a virtual shareholder information event took place. The former Chairman, the new Chairman and the Group CEO spoke to the shareholders and a podium discussion with several members of the Group EC was held. The members also answered the shareholders' questions, which had been submitted prior to the event. Furthermore, the Group Company Secretary presented the results of the AGM elections and votes.\n\n## Convocation\n\nThe Board of Directors convenes the shareholders' meetings through a notice published in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce at least 20 days before the date of the meeting. The notice states the day, time and place of the shareholders' meetings, along with the agenda and proposals. The ordinary shareholders' meeting must take place within six months after the close of the financial year on 31 December. The Board of Directors convenes extraordinary shareholders' meetings, if necessary or if required by a shareholders' meeting resolution or by one or more shareholders with voting rights whose combined holdings represent at least 10% of the share capital.\n\n## Request to place an item on the agenda\n\nShareholders with voting rights whose combined holdings represent shares with a nominal value of at least CHF 100 000 may, no later than 45 days before the date of the shareholders' meeting, request in writing that a particular item, together with the relevant proposals, is included on the agenda.\n\n## Statutory quorums\n\nThe shareholders' meetings can pass resolutions regardless of the number of shareholders present or shares represented by proxies. The resolutions require an absolute majority of the votes validly cast, excluding blank and invalid ballots, except where the law requires otherwise.\n\nFor further information on shareholders' participation rights, please refer to the Articles of Association.\n\n## Annual General Meeting 2022\n\nThe health of Swiss Re's shareholders and employees is of the utmost importance. The Board of Directors therefore decided to hold the AGM taking place on 13 April 2022 without the in-person presence of the shareholders. This option is provided by the Swiss Federal Council in Article 27 of its COVID-19 Ordinance 3, whose term has been extended until December 2022. Swiss Re invites all shareholders to watch the shareholder information event taking place after the AGM on the same day via webcast. Shareholders may submit questions prior to the event. Further information is provided with the invitation to the AGM as well as online.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAGM\n\nwww.swissre.com/agm2022",

A company may, in its articles of association, raise this threshold to up to 49% of the voting rights (opting up) or, under specific circumstances, disapply the duty to make an offer (opting out). Swiss Re Ltd has not introduced such provisions.\n\n## Clauses on changes of control\n\nThe mandates and employment contracts of the members of the Board of Directors, the Group EC and further executive management members do not contain any provisions such as severance payments, notice periods of more than 12 months, additional pension fund contributions or the treatment of deferred compensation that would benefit them in a change of control situation.\n\nUnvested deferred compensation may vest and employee participation plan rules may be amended upon a change of control. In such an event, the rights of members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC, as well as of further executive management members, are identical to those of all other employees.

        "page_content": "## External auditors\n\nThe shareholders elected KPMG as Swiss Re's new external auditor.\n\n## Duration of the mandate and term of the lead auditors\n\nIn line with Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, the external auditor is elected annually by the shareholders. At the AGM on 16 April 2020, the shareholders elected KPMG, Zurich, as the new external auditor for SRL and the Swiss Re Group, effective for the financial year starting on 1 January 2021. KPMG fully meets the high requirements requested by Swiss Re. The Audit Committee has received confirmation from KPMG that it complies with the relevant independence requirements to exercise the mandate as Swiss Re's external auditor. KPMG has taken over the mandate from PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd (PwC), which had been Swiss Re's external auditor since 1991.\n\nFrank Pfaffenzeller und Eric Elman have served as KPMG's lead auditors since KPMG took office. In line with the Swiss Code of Obligations and to foster external auditor independence, each of the two lead auditors rotates out of his or her role after seven years.\n\nKPMG was re-elected by the AGM on 16 April 2021, for another one-year term of office.\n\nUnlike in the European Union, there is no law in Switzerland that provides for a mandatory rotation of the external auditor after a certain number of years. The Audit Committee closely monitors related regulatory developments in the EU and elsewhere.\n\n## Auditor rotation 2021/transition\n\nIn the course of the financial year 2020, PwC assisted in the transition to the new external auditor KPMG. Once PwC had concluded their work on the 2020 audit, KPMG took over as Swiss Re's new external auditor effective for the financial year starting on 1 January 2021.\n\n## Supervision of the external audit process\n\nThe external auditor is accountable to the Audit Committee, the Board of Directors and ultimately to the shareholders. The Board of Directors reviews the external auditor's professional qualifications. The Audit Committee assists the Board of Directors in its oversight. The Audit Committee liaises closely with the external auditor. The lead auditors participate as advisors at all Audit Committee meetings (For more information, see page 99). The Audit Committee reviews and approves all planned audit services and any non-audit services provided by the external auditor. It discusses the results of annual audits with the external auditor, including reports on the financial statements, necessary changes to the audit plans and critical accounting issues. The external auditor shares with the Audit Committee its findings on the adequacy of the financial reporting process and the efficacy of the internal controls. It informs the Audit Committee about any differences of opinion between the external auditor and management encountered during the audits or in connection with the preparation of the financial statements.\n\n## Fees paid to the auditor\n\nThe fees (excluding value added tax) for professional services provided by KPMG in 2021 were as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                        |   2020* | 2021   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------|---------|--------|\n| Audit fees                                          |    30.7 | 21.2   |\n| Non-audit fees                                      |     3.5 | 1.5    |\n| Audit-related assurance services                    |     0.9 | 0.4    |\n| Services relating to corporate finance transactions |     0.3 | -      |\n| Tax-related services                                |     0.3 | 0.2    |\n| Other non-audit services                            |     2   | 0.9    |\n| Total fees                                          |    34.2 | 22.7   |",

        "page_content": "## Evaluation of the external auditor\n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for recommending an audit firm to the Board of Directors for election by the shareholders. In order to be able to select and propose an audit firm for its election proposal to the shareholders and in line with good corporate governance, the Audit Committee thoroughly evaluates the credentials of the current external auditor annually based on the following main criteria: Investment in the client relationship, quality of delivery, quality of the people and services and focus on client value. The Audit Committee presents the findings of the evaluation to the entire Board of Directors. The Audit Committee's assessment of the external auditor is furthermore based on the external auditor's qualifications, independence and performance. The Audit Committee also evaluates the performance of the lead auditors annually.\n\n## Qualifications\n\nThe external auditor submits, at least once a year, a report to the Audit Committee describing its own quality control, including any material issues raised by its most recent internal reviews or inquiries or investigations by governmental or professional authorities within the preceding five years, as well as any steps taken to deal with any such issues.\n\n## Independence\n\nAt least once a year, the external auditor provides a formal written statement delineating all relationships with Swiss Re that might affect its independence. Any disclosed relationships or services that might interfere with the external auditor's objectivity and independence are reviewed by the Audit Committee, which then recommends appropriate action to be taken by the Board of Directors.\n\n## Performance\n\nThis assessment measures the external auditor's performance against a number of criteria, including: understanding of Swiss Re's business; technical knowledge and expertise; comprehensiveness of the audit plans; quality of the working relationship with management and clarity of communication. It is compiled based on the input of key people involved in the financial reporting process and the observations of the Audit Committee members.\n\nKPMG and PwC (until the end of their mandate at the AGM on 16 April 2021) provided reports on selected topics at each of the Audit Committee meetings during the reporting year 2021.

The Compensation Committee's activities included:\n\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the Swiss Re incentive\n- compensation framework to further foster a pay-for-performance culture and effectively align stakeholder interests. The review resulted in a simplified process for funding the Group Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool, with a stronger focus on financial performance. In addition, the cash-based deferral plan (Value Alignment Incentive/VAI) will be replaced by a new deferred share plan. The existing Leadership Share Plan (LSP) remains in place with more demanding targets and a broader vesting range on the relative Total Shareholder Return performance condition. These changes apply as of 2022, ie in-flight cycles are not impacted. Further details are provided in the section Group compensation framework, 2021 outcomes and 2022 changes.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring continued strengthening of the pay-for-performance approach by further aligning reward priorities to the business strategy and encouraging performance differentiation.\n- \u00b7 Reviewing the Swiss Re stock ownership guidelines to ensure that a part of the wealth of executives and other key employees is exposed to the same share price risk as that of shareholders. As a result of the review, the ownership requirement for the Group CEO was increased from three times to five times his annual base salary as of 2022.\n- \u00b7 Re-evaluating the mandates for the Compensation Committee advisors and conducting a competitive proposal process. As a result, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd was selected as a new independent advisor.",

        "page_content": "## 2021 Group business results and pay for performance\n\nThe compensation framework aims to promote sustainable performance and long-term shareholder value creation through key performance measures and equitybased compensation. For 2021, Swiss Re's commitment to pay for performance translated into the following outcomes:\n\n- \u00b7 Overall performance: Key to annual compensation decisions was a combination of financial and qualitative factors. Compensation decisions were made considering Swiss Re's overall performance for the reporting year in which Swiss Re reported a US GAAP net income of USD 1.4 billion and a return on equity (ROE) of 5.7%. The Group's US GAAP and economic performance significantly improved compared with 2020, despite major COVID-19-related impacts and a high occurrence of large-loss natural catastrophe events. Property & Casualty Reinsurance (P&C Reinsurance) reported strong profit and a net income of USD 2.1 billion, reflecting improved portfolio quality and rate increases, as well as favourable investment results. P&C Reinsurance grew its premiums earned by 5.3% and achieved a normalised combined ratio of 94.7%, in line with its target of less than 95.0% for the full year. Life & Health Reinsurance (L&H Reinsurance) was impacted by significant COVID-19-related losses, incurring significantly higher COVID-19-related claims in 2021. Excluding COVID-19-related losses, L&H Reinsurance improved net income by 26% to USD 1.1 billion in 2021. Corporate Solutions reported a strong net income of USD 578 million in 2021, as the Business Unit continued to benefit from decisive strategic actions implemented in the past few years and ongoing price increases. With a normalised combined ratio of 95.0% for the full year, Corporate Solutions surpassed its target of less than 97.0% in 2021.\n- \u00b7 Annual bonus: As the Group is still significantly impacted by COVID-19related losses, it missed three of its four financial Key Performance Indicators relevant for the Group API. Even though performance across all qualitative KPIs was above target, the Group API pool is below target. The Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors did not exercise any upward or downward discretion.\n- \u00b7 Deferred compensation: The VAI 2018 (awarded 2019) performance factor for the Swiss Re Group is 93.1% based on the average 2019-2021 previous years' business performance. Further performance factors range from 76.6% to 100.5%. The main drivers were previous years' business losses which were mainly driven by reserve increases, for instance due to COVID-19-related losses and in relation to US casualty.\n- \u00b7 Long-term incentive: Outcomes for the Leadership Performance Plan 2019 (vesting in 2022) were below target with an average performance factor of 17.3% for the three-year performance period on the ROE condition and of 0.0% on the relative Total Shareholder Return condition. The combined performance factor reflecting the three-year performance period is outlined on page 143.\n\n## Shareholder engagement and Annual General Meeting (AGM)\n\nThe compensation framework and decisions continue to receive strong support from shareholders. At the AGM on 16 April 2021, shareholders approved all binding compensation-related motions and the 2020 Compensation Report was approved in a consultative vote.\n\nIn the course of 2021, Swiss Re engaged directly with shareholders and proxy advisors, such as during the annual Chairman's Roadshow. Swiss Re's compensation framework (including potential changes to the framework), compensation-related decisions and the compensation disclosure approach were discussed. Further details on shareholder engagement are provided in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 83 and 116.\n\nThe Compensation Committee is grateful for the fruitful engagement and continues to proactively consider shareholders' and proxy advisors' expectations. As a result, the following key enhancements have been implemented for this Compensation Report:\n\n- \u00b7 The Group CEO scorecard presenting the basis for how the Board of Directors determined the annual bonus outcome for the Group CEO, is disclosed.\n- \u00b7 The Compensation Report structure has been revised to increase clarity and conciseness, and a summary of key compensation information is included.\n\nConsistent with last year and in line with Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, shareholders will be asked to vote on the following motions at the AGM 2022:\n\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of compensation for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2022 to the AGM 2023.\n- \u00b7 Maximum aggregate amount of fixed compensation and variable long-term compensation for the members of the Group EC for the financial year 2023.\n- \u00b7 Aggregate amount of variable short-term compensation for the members of the Group Executive Committee (Group EC) for the financial year 2021.\n\nFurthermore, the Compensation Report will be submitted to the shareholders for a consultative vote.\n\nThis Compensation Report complies with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including Articles 14 to 16 of the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies limited by Shares.\n\n17 March 2022\n\nJacques de Vaucleroy Chair Compensation Committee\n\n<!-- image -->",

Swiss Re has a non-discriminatory approach to determining compensation and benefits at all levels. Key pillars of the approach are:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSound governance around compensation decision-making and approvals to ensure appropriate checks and balances.\n\nCompensation ranges defined by job family or specialisation in the local market, which ensure that compensation for employees in the same country/location is set based on consistent benchmarks.\n\nAnnual review of individual salaries and target incentives to maintain internal pay equity and pay for performance.\n\nRegular statistical analysis using best practice methodologies to identify and address potential risks of bias.\n\nPay equity reviews are conducted regularly with a focus on an 'adjusted gender pay gap' comparing pay for people in similar roles, in the same country and same hierarchical level. During the most recent review conducted in April 2021, this measure did not reveal any systemic bias: globally, the adjusted pay gap between men and women stood at 1.7% on average. An inclusive and diverse workforce is critical to the success of the business. More details on Swiss Re's initiatives fostering diversity are provided in the Sustainability Report available at www.swissre.com/sustainability.\n\n## Spotlight: Strong link between compensation and performance against sustainability/environmental, social and governance (ESG) targets\n\nSwiss Re clearly links compensation outcomes to performance against sustainability-related targets. To ensure measurability and line of sight for participants through transparency and simplicity, Swiss Re considers sustainability criteria in the annual bonus assessment where relevant. Targets are defined at the beginning of the year and performance against these is considered within the annual assessment process. As a result, sustainability-related performance impacts compensation for all employees, including the Group EC. Key considerations for the sustainability target-setting process are shown in the figure on the right.\n\n## Sustainability targets in compensation Sustainability targets in compensation\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "## Compensation philosophy and governance\n\n## Guiding principles of Swiss Re's compensation framework\n\nSwiss Re's compensation framework is designed to reflect the nature of its business by:\n\n- \u00b7 Reinforcing a culture of sustainable performance with a focus on risk-adjusted financial results.\n- \u00b7 Ensuring alignment of compensation to long-term business results and individual contribution, and recognising both what was achieved and how it was achieved.\n- \u00b7 Attracting, motivating and retaining the qualified talent the Group needs to succeed globally.\n- \u00b7 Supporting Swiss Re's commitment to ensure equal pay for equal work regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics.\n- \u00b7 Aligning the interests of employees with those of Swiss Re's shareholders and society at large.\n- \u00b7 Fostering compliance, supporting appropriate and controlled risk-taking in line with Swiss Re's business and risk strategy, and avoiding conflicts of interest.\n\nSwiss Re's total compensation is well balanced in terms of fixed versus variable compensation and short-term versus long-term incentives. This encourages sustainable long-term performance and supports shareholder alignment. Complemented by pension plans and benefits, the total reward package is competitive in local labour markets.\n\n## Compensation Policy\n\nBuilding on the overarching compensation principles included in Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, the compensation framework is captured within the Swiss Re Group Compensation Policy (Compensation Policy). The Compensation Policy is implemented globally to the extent possible. Variations may apply at the regional, entity and Business Unit (including Division iptiQ) level to accommodate specific requirements, such as compliance with local regulations and talent management. The Compensation Policy governs the compensation structure and processes and is regularly reviewed by Human Resources, Risk Management and the Compensation Committee against FINMA requirements and further relevant regulations as appropriate.\n\n## Approval authorities\n\nAuthority for decisions related to compensation at the Board of Directors and Group EC level is governed by Swiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association, which include rules on:\n\n- \u00b7 The annual and binding approval by the AGM of the maximum aggregate amounts of compensation of members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC (Article 22).\n- \u00b7 The supplementary amount for changes in the Group EC if the maximum aggregate amount of compensation approved by the AGM is not sufficient to also cover compensation of a new Group EC member (Article 23).\n- \u00b7 The compensation principles for both the members of the Board of Directors and of the Group EC covering short-term and long-term elements, performance-related pay, payment in shares, financial instruments or units, compensation in kind or other types of benefits (Article 24).\n- \u00b7 The agreements with members of the Board of Directors and the Group EC, external mandates and credits and loans (Articles 25 to 27).\n\nSwiss Re Ltd's Articles of Association are complemented by stringent governance on compensation matters set out in the Bylaws of Swiss Re Ltd and in the Bylaws of Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd, including the Charter of the Compensation Committee. Authority levels are summarised in the table overleaf.\n\nThe Board of Directors has approved an authority matrix that defines the limits to which each level of management can authorise compensation payments. The Group CEO, the Compensation Committee or the Board of Directors, as applicable, approve all compensation that exceeds the pre-set limits. The Group CEO is not involved in decision-making concerning his own compensation. The Board of Directors also establishes and periodically reviews Swiss Re's compensation framework (including guidelines and performance criteria) and prepares the compensationrelated proposals to the AGM.\n\nFurther details can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 78-116 and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/articles and www.swissre.com/bylaws.",

It operates as the Group's compensation committee and oversees the compensation framework applied at all entities of the Swiss Re Group. In 2021, the Compensation Committee consisted of five independent members of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe Compensation Committee has an annual agenda to ensure that important reviews take place at the right times throughout the year, including the oversight of each stage of the compensation cycle. The Compensation Committee also commits time to executive sessions and conducts a periodic self-evaluation to preserve its high level of effectiveness.\n\nDuring 2021, the Compensation Committee held six meetings and provided updates to the Board of Directors on topics discussed, decisions made and items for approval after each of these meetings. In addition, the Compensation Committee passed five decisions by circular resolution.\n\nThe Chairman of the Board of Directors, the Group CEO and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services participate in the Compensation Committee meetings. Other members of senior management may attend as deemed appropriate and upon invitation by the Chair of the Compensation Committee. Management members do not attend when their own compensation is discussed. The Global Head Reward serves as the Secretary to the Compensation Committee and attends its meetings (excluding the executive sessions).\n\nFurther details on the Compensation Committee can be found in the Corporate Governance Report (page 99 and page 101) and on Swiss Re's webpage at www.swissre.com/bylaws, including the Charter of the Compensation Committee.",

In 2021, a Request for Proposal (RFP) was conducted following a re-evaluation of the Compensation Committee's independent advisor mandate. During the RFP, selected advisors with the required capabilities and with strong standings in the market were invited to offer their services. Following several rounds of assessments, PricewaterhouseCoopers Ltd was selected and assumed the mandate as of 1 September 2021, providing information about remuneration trends and advice on executive compensation issues. The previous advisor, Mercer, continued to provide market benchmarking during 2021. In addition, Niederer Kraft Frey Ltd provided legal advice, mainly about specific aspects of compliance, plan rules and disclosure matters regarding compensation. The advisors may also have other mandates with Swiss Re. The Compensation Committee annually reviews the external advisors' role and mandate.\n\n## Additional safeguards in governing compensation: Control functions and key risk takers\n\nSwiss Re bears risks in the course of its business activities, including market, credit and liquidity, underwriting, operational (including legal and compliance) and reputational risk. The Control Functions (defined as Group Risk Management, Compliance and Group Internal Audit) annually perform an independent assessment of risk and control-related behaviours of the Group and each of the Business Units/Group Functions, and of Swiss Re's Key Risk Takers individually. These reports are delivered to key executives including the Group Chief Risk Officer and the Group Chief Human Resources Officer & Head Corporate Services. The risk and control-related behaviour assessment of Group and Business Units/Group Functions provides additional input to determine the Group Annual Performance Incentive (API) pool and its allocation to each Business Unit/Group Function. The assessment results of each Key Risk Taker serve as additional input when considering individual performance and compensation outcomes.\n\nTo ensure meaningful assessments, the continued independence of Control Functions needs to be safeguarded. Hence, each aggregate API pool for the Control Functions and individual compensation for the Head of each Control Function are approved at Board level.\n\n## Prohibition of personal hedging strategies\n\nAny use of personal hedging strategies or remuneration and liability-related insurance that could undermine the risk alignment effects and economic exposure embedded in compensation arrangements is prohibited.",

        "page_content": "## Board compensation\n\n## Compensation framework for the Board of Directors\n\nThe objective of compensating members of the Board of Directors is to attract and retain experienced individuals who are highly motivated to perform a critical role in the strategic oversight of Swiss Re and to contribute their individual business experience and expertise.\n\nThe fee structure for the members of the Board of Directors takes into account their long-term contribution to Swiss Re's success and achieves strong alignment with shareholder interests:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nBoard members receive no variable or performance-based compensation.\n\nFees are delivered 60% in cash and 40% in shares.\n\nShares are subject to a four-year blocking period.\n\nThe fee level for each member of the Board of Directors is reviewed annually and benchmarked regularly. For further information on the benchmarking provider and the peer group, please refer to page 127 and page 132 of this Compensation Report.\n\nSince 2018, all fees for Board of Director memberships remained flat (ie the fee for the Chairman, the Vice Chairman, the base fees as well as all committee fees). Individual fee levels vary to reflect roles, responsibilities and time commitment, for instance due to committee memberships that differ in meeting frequency or duration.\n\nA minimum Swiss pension fund solution is provided to members of the Board of Directors who are not exempted from mandatory occupational benefit plans in Switzerland. This is offered by an established external provider and applies only to a limited number of individuals depending on their personal situation due to which local law imposes such pension solution. Pension contributions are split equally between Swiss Re and the respective individual. Contributions made by Swiss Re are included in the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval.\n\n## Subsidiary boards\n\nThe majority of the board members at subsidiary level are Swiss Re executives who do not receive any additional compensation for their services in these roles. When a member of the Board of Directors also serves on the board of a subsidiary, the maximum aggregate compensation of the Board of Directors proposed to the AGM for approval also includes such subsidiary board fees.\n\n34.0\n\n29.9\n\n34.0\n\n## Board of Directors 34,0 29.9\n\nTerm of office: AGM 2021-AGM 2022 CHF millions 29,9 34,0\n\n29,9\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n10.3\n\nMaximum aggregate amount approved 9.9 10.3\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n9.9\n\nAmount paid/granted\n\n## Say on pay\n\nAt the AGM 2021, shareholders approved a maximum aggregate amount of compensation of CHF 10.3 million for the members of the Board of Directors for the term of office from the AGM 2021 to the AGM 2022. The compensation paid to the 13 members of the Board of Directors for their term of office from the AGM 2021 to the AGM 2022 was CHF 9.9 million and therefore within the approved amount.\n\nFurther details on the compensation for members of the Board of Directors are provided in the tables on the following page. Currency conversions are calculated using December 2021 year-to-date FX rates for 2021 and 2022 figures, and December 2020 year-to-date FX rates for 2020 figures, where relevant.",

The stock ownership guidelines define the following target ownership levels by role:\n\n- \u00b7 Group CEO: three times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other Group EC members: two times annual base salary.\n- \u00b7 Other key senior executives: one time annual base salary.\n\n2022 change: The Compensation Committee decided that as of 2022 the Group CEO is expected to hold Swiss Re stocks equaling five times his annual base salary to create an even stronger alignment with shareholders.\n\nThe target has to be achieved within five years. All vested shares that are owned directly or indirectly by the relevant individual and related parties will be included in the assessment. As Swiss Re believes that a meaningful stock ownership position is essential for alignment with the interests of shareholders, restrictions on cash payouts may apply in case of non-compliance. Compliance with the stock ownership guidelines is reviewed on an annual basis and the findings are reported to the Compensation Committee, which decides on appropriate actions as needed.\n\nDuring the 2021 assessment, all Group EC members fulfilled the applicable stock ownership guidelines.",

        "page_content": "## Compensation\n\n## Benchmarking\n\nAn external compensation advisor to the Compensation Committee conducts an annual review of the compensation of the Group EC relative to a group of reference companies (ie peer group) to ensure that market competitiveness is maintained. This peer group is regularly reviewed by the Compensation Committee to ensure its relevance. The 2021 core peer group consists of the following globally active primary insurance and reinsurance firms: AIA Group Ltd, Allianz SE, American International Group Inc, Aviva PLC, AXA SA, Chubb Limited, Hannover Rueck SE, Insurance Australia Group Ltd, MetLife Inc, Muenchener RueckversicherungsGesellschaft AG, Prudential PLC, QBE Insurance Group Ltd, Reinsurance Group of America Inc, SCOR SE and Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. For further information on external advisors, please refer to page 127 of this Compensation Report.\n\n## Employment conditions and clauses on changes of control\n\nThe Group EC members, including the Group CEO, have open-ended employment agreements with notice periods of 12 months for termination by either the company or the individual. Their employment agreements comply with the Ordinance against Excessive Remuneration in Listed Companies limited by Shares (Ordinance). They do not contain severance clauses, any special provisions on the cancellation of contractual arrangements, agreements concerning special notice periods, waivers of lock-up periods for options, shorter vesting periods, additional contributions to pension funds or any other provisions protecting against changes of control ('golden parachutes'). Group EC members are covered by the Group's standard defined contribution pension plans. Information on the mandates and employment contracts of the members of the Board of Directors and further executive management is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 113.\n\nIn the event of a change of control, the rights of members of the Group EC are identical to those of all other employees as governed by VAI, Leadership Performance Plan (LPP) and LSP plan rules. Specifically, the Board of Directors may decide at its discretion on the continuation, acceleration, amendment, or removal of any vesting, blocking or exercise conditions for the payment or grant of deferred compensation. It may also decide to replace any LPP/LSP award with shares of the entity assuming control. In addition, it may apply any other measure which it considers equitable and reasonable, provided this does not constitute impermissible compensation pursuant to the Ordinance. Should the Board of Directors decide to accelerate vesting, performance factors will generally be based on the latest performance estimates available. Information on the quantitative impact of vested shares is provided in the Corporate Governance Report on page 89.\n\n## Compensation for the highest-paid member of the Group EC\n\nThe table below shows the compensation paid to Christian Mumenthaler, Group CEO.

In consideration of those amendments (which apply to the Group CEO and Group EC members insured in Switzerland as well as all other employees insured in Switzerland), the figures disclosed for 2020 and 2021 include higher employer pension contributions and contributions to mitigate the effects of lower conversion rates.",

        "page_content": "## Group EC performance assessment and compensation\n\nThe members of the Group EC are assessed based on Swiss Re's performance, which directly impacts their compensation. Further, their compensation is affected by the Business Unit and individual performance as assessed by the Group CEO. The Compensation Committee reviews the effectiveness of the Group's performance management process and compensation proposals for the Group EC members. During 2021, performance translated into pay outcomes as follows:\n\n## \u00b7 Performance assessment process:\n\nPerformance is assessed against a set of quantitative and qualitative objectives. Objectives are agreed at the beginning of the year and are aligned with the Group's strategy. The assessment of Swiss Re's performance follows the same three-step approach and KPIs as applicable to all employees (outlined on pages 138-139 of this Compensation Report). For the Group CEO, an individual scorecard is applied (see page 133 of this Compensation Report).\n\n- \u00b7 Group EC performance outcomes:\n\nThe Group made significant progress in all relevant areas of the business aligned with\n\nthe Group's strategy and ambitions for performance culture. The results are reflective of the work of the Group EC to strengthen business performance and improve underwriting quality. The improvement was based on the completion of the turnaround of Corporate Solutions, the P&C Reinsurance portfolio rebalancing, and the prudent renewal approach in 2021. The Group EC also successfully steered the Group through the second year of the ongoing pandemic, adapting to change and addressing needs of employees.\n\n## Upcoming changes\n\nThe Compensation Committee intends to revise the Group EC performance assessment process as of performance year 2022. The aim is to create a balanced scorecard to align the performance assessment of the Group EC to the practice used for the Group CEO.\n\n## 2021 aggregate amount of Group EC variable short-term compensation\n\nFor 2021, the Group EC target API pool (pro-rata amount in relation to the active period on the Group EC, including the Group CEO) amounted to CHF 17.1 million compared with CHF 17.6 million in 2020.\n\n## Additional information on Group EC compensation\n\n| Other payments                                   | No payments (or waivers of claims) other than those set out in this section (Group EC compensation) were made  to current members of the Group EC or persons closely related.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Pension schemes                                  | Each member of the Group EC, including the Group CEO, participates in a defined contribution pension scheme.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Related parties transactions                     | Disclosure on compensation in 2021 covers members of the Group EC and includes related parties to the extent  applicable (spouses, partners, children and other dependents or closely linked persons). In 2021, no  compensation was paid to any related party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Loans and credits                                | As per Article 27 of the Articles of Association, credits and loans to members of the Group EC may be granted   at employee conditions applicable for the Swiss Re Group, with a cap on the total amount of such credits and  loans outstanding per member (currently CHF 3.0 million per member of the Group EC). During 2019, any  outstanding loans and mortgages to current and former Group EC members were transferred to an external  party. No credits, loans or mortgages were granted to current or former members of the Group EC in 2021.                                                        |\n| Payments to former members   of governing bodies | During 2021, payments in the total amount of CHF 0.7 million were made to ten former members of the  Group EC. This amount is made up of legally or contractually required payments for the period when the  individual was no longer in the Group EC position, company contributions payable by Swiss Re to governmental  social security systems in line with applicable laws, matching shares awarded in the context of outstanding  Global Share Participation Plan cycles, risk benefits, pension contributions and company commitments for  tax-related services in line with contractual obligations. |\n| Value of awards granted                          | For US GAAP and statutory reporting purposes, VAI and LSP awards are accrued over the period during which  they are earned. For the purpose of the disclosure required in this Compensation Report, the value of awards  granted is included as compensation in the year of performance for the years 2020 and 2021, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\nThe decrease is primarily due to the lower number of Group EC members active during the course of the year as outlined on the previous page. For the Group CEO, the target API was CHF 2.5 million (no change compared with 2020).\n\nThe proposed total API (including VAI) amount for 2021 for the Group EC (including the Group CEO) is CHF 16.0 million and includes pro-rata payments in relation to the active period on the Group EC for individuals who joined or left the Group EC in 2021. This represents an increase of CHF 0.9 million compared with the approved total 2020 API (including VAI) amount of CHF 15.1 million for the Group EC. The increase is primarily attributable to the higher Group Business Performance Factor (0.92 in 2021 compared with 0.84 in 2020), ie reflecting better business results. After carefully considering the performance of the Group EC in 2021, the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors concluded that the proposed amount is proportionate given the overall business environment for the Swiss Re Group, the quantitative and qualitative achievements, and in alignment with shareholder interests.",

ROE\n- 2.  Net operating margin\n- 3.   EVM profit (% of ENW)\n- 4.   ENW growth per share\n\nResults in Financial Performance Factor floored at 0.7 and capped at 1.3\n\nThe key objectives of Swiss Re's benefits packages are to:\n\n- \u00b7 Be competitive in the markets where Swiss Re competes for talent.\n- \u00b7 Provide a degree of financial resilience for employees as it relates to pension, health matters, disability and death.\n- \u00b7 Connect with Swiss Re values and enhance engagement.\n\nForfeiture provisions apply in line with local market practice in certain benefit plans (eg common forfeiture provisions in retirement savings plans).\n\n## Annual bonus: API\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe Annual Performance Incentive (API) is a discretionary, variable component of compensation. Combined with the base salary, it provides competitive total cash compensation for achievements\n\n## Step 2\n\n## Qualitative assessment\n\n## Four qualitative dimensions\n\n(weighted and assessed as appropriate for the Group, Business Units and Group Functions):\n\n- 1.   Operational excellence and franchise value (including, among others, control and risk behaviour)\n- 2.   Human capital and talent management\n- 3.  Strategic initiatives\n- 4.  Sustainability/ESG\n\nResults in Qualitative Performance Factor floored at 0.0 and capped at 1.3\n\nAllows for discretionary upward or downward adjustment based on all information available\n\n## Step 3\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nSeries of overarching tests , eg pay for performance linkage, assessment of market competitiveness, multi-year view and review of quality of earnings, and affordability checks.\n\nagainst both business and individual performance targets and for the demonstration of desired behaviours.\n\n## Funding\n\nSwiss Re uses a three-step assessment process to determine the Group API pool as outlined in the illustration below.\n\nThe financial and qualitative performance assessment each result in a performance factor (Financial Performance Factor/FPF and Qualitative Performance Factor/QPF). A performance threshold and maximum are built into both assessments by way of a floor and cap. For the financial assessment, the floor is at 0.7 while for the qualitative assessment it is at 0.0. The cap on both assessments is at 1.3. This serves to avoid excessive upward or downward volatility in the Group API pool and is reflective of the long-tail nature of Swiss Re's business.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n+\n\n-\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nOverall Group assessment and proposal from management to the Compensation Committee.\n\nThe Compensation Committee reviews, may request adjustment to any of the steps and recommends the final pool for approval to the full Board of Directors.\n\nBased on steps 1, 2 and 3, results in Group Business Performance Factor\n\nA p p r o ve d G r o u p A P I p o o l",

        "page_content": "Further, this practice protects the franchise by ensuring positive but not excessive variable compensation payouts in relatively benign environments and lower but proportionate payouts in adverse environments.\n\nThe FPF and QPF are multiplied and the result can then be adjusted based on the overall assessment, whereby the Compensation Committee can apply discretion to make an upward or downward adjustment to the Group API pool recommended for approval to the Board of Directors. Discretion is only exercised in extraordinary circumstances (eg to protect the franchise or ensure business continuity), and is disclosed transparently if applied.\n\nCombined, the three assessment steps allow for determining a Group Business Performance Factor (Group BPF) based on the following formula:\n\n| Overall                                |\n|----------------------------------------|\n| Group BPF = (FPF \u00d7 QPF) +/- Assessment |\n| Result                                 |\n\nThe Group API pool is subsequently determined by multiplying the Group target API pool with the Group BPF.\n\n## Allocation\n\nBased on financial and qualitative performance, the Group CEO splits the Group API pool into pools for the Group EC, other senior executives, and for different Business Units/Group Functions. The API for each individual employee is then determined considering their target API, business and individual performance. Individual performance is assessed against the individual's established goals and Swiss Re's behaviour expectations and corporate values. Goals, as well as expected behaviours, are aligned to Swiss Re's purpose and business strategy. Swiss Re's 'leadership from every seat' philosophy, as part of which desired behaviours are clearly articulated, is embedded in the continuous performance management and feedback discussions. This allows for forward-looking conversations that foster real-time\n\nimprovement and faster adaptation to business needs. In doing so, Swiss Re ensures robust performance differentiation and transparent pay for performance.\n\nThe possible API award for individual employees ranges from zero to two times target API. When the total API level for an employee equals or exceeds a pre-defined amount, a portion is deferred into the Value Alignment Incentive (VAI). The non-deferred portion is settled in immediate cash (cash API). Forfeiture of unsettled awards and clawback provisions for settled awards apply in a range of events, enabling Swiss Re to seek repayment where appropriate. Examples of such events are acts which can be considered as malfeasance, fraud or misconduct.\n\n## 2021 API outcomes\n\nFinancial and qualitative performance have been assessed by the Compensation Committee and the Board of Directors against KPIs and targets set at the beginning of the year. For 2021, Swiss Re reported a US GAAP net income of USD 1.4 billion and an ROE of 5.7%, considerably rebounding from a net loss of USD 878 million in 2020. This result was achieved as the Group absorbed large natural catastrophe losses across its businesses as well as COVID-19related claims. The vast majority of the COVID-19-related losses originated in the L&H Reinsurance business, while impacts on the property and casualty businesses were minimal. Excluding the impacts of COVID-19 losses, Swiss Re's net income increased by 39% year on year to USD 3.0 billion. Although Swiss Re continued to grow all its businesses and increased net premiums earned and fee income for the Group by 4.8% compared with the previous year, the Group is still significantly impacted by COVID-19 related claims and thus missed three out of four financial KPIs relevant for the Group API. Therefore, the FPF was calculated at 0.82. Further details on Swiss Re's financial performance can be found on pages 198-311 of this Financial Report.\n\nOn the qualitative side, strong achievements on ESG stood out, including high stakeholder engagement and an excellent ranking on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI), where Swiss Re ranked second in the insurance sector. Further information on sustainability achievements can be found in Swiss Re's Sustainability Report. In addition, client satisfaction measured through Net Promoter Scores (NPS) remained strong and further progress has been made on diversity in senior management. Overall, qualitative performance across all KPIs was above target, resulting in a QPF of 1.12.\n\nThe Board of Directors applied no upward or downward discretion. The Group BPF was calculated at (0.82 \u00d7 1.12) \u00b1 0 = 0.92 (against a theoretical maximum Group BPF of 2.0 and a minimum of 0).\n\n## 2022 changes\n\nThe API pool funding process will be simplified, and a stronger focus will be placed on financial performance outcomes as of performance year 2022. In addition, any floor component in the Group API pool funding process will be removed while the cap limiting the upside potential will be maintained. This will further strengthen Swiss Re's pay-for-performance approach. Qualitative assessments (including ESG-related KPIs and risk and control behaviour) will continue to impact Business Unit/Group Function and individual API allocations as relevant.\n\nComprehensive details on the design of the 2022 Group API pool funding process will be provided in the 2022 Compensation Report to be published in 2023.",

The higher the API granted, the greater the\n\ndeferral into the VAI. The VAI ensures that variable compensation remains at risk and adequately reflects the business outcomes that materialise over the mid-term, taking into account under- or over-reserving in the past. This supports the Group's business model by aligning a portion of short-term\n\nvariable compensation with sustainable results as the ultimate value of the VAI depends on the performance of the relevant Business Unit and the Group over the performance period.\n\n## Portion of API that is deferred into the VAI\n\nDeferral into VAI\n\n| Group CEO              | 50% of API                                                                                                                                       |\n|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Other Group EC members | 45% of API                                                                                                                                       |\n| Other key executives   | 40% of API                                                                                                                                       |\n| All other employees    | 50% of the API amount exceeding USD 100 000 with a minimum deferral amount of USD 5 000 at   USD 100 000 and up to a maximum of 40% of total API |\n\n## Design\n\nThe performance measurement calculation uses the three-year average of the published EVM previous years' business profit margin.\n\nEVM is Swiss Re's proprietary integrated economic valuation and steering framework, consistently measuring performance across all businesses. EVM previous years' business profit measures the economic performance of existing contracts\n\nin comparison to the valuation assumptions set in the past; ie under- or over-reserving in the past leads to a corresponding negative or positive EVM previous years' business performance when reserves are adjusted in the current year.\n\nAt the end of the deferral period, the VAI is settled in cash. The performance factor is a linear function, whereby payout ranges from 50-150%.\n\n## VAI design\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFor the full three-year vesting period, forfeiture conditions apply.

The main drivers were previous years' business losses which were mainly driven by reserve increases. Especially, reserve increases were required for COVID-19-related losses in L&H Reinsurance in 2021 and in Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions in 2020. Further, reserve increases were required for US casualty in Corporate Solutions and P&C Reinsurance in 2019. This led to performance factors ranging from 76.6% (Corporate Solutions) to 100.5% (elipsLife).\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Illustrative example of realised performance for the VAI 2018 (awarded 2019)\n\nGranted and realised VAI are shown on the right for a grant of CHF 100 000 on the VAI 2018 (awarded 2019). For illustrative purposes, this example considers only the Group performance factor.\n\n## 2022 changes\n\nAs of performance year 2022 (ie for deferred awards as of 2023), the VAI will be replaced by a new deferred share plan to better align employee and shareholder interests and to conform to market practice.\n\nThe new Deferred Share Plan (DSP) will apply to the Group CEO, other Group EC members, key executives and individuals with an API equal to or exceeding USD 150 000.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe deferral percentages will remain unchanged (as indicated in the table on the previous page). Deferral will be in the form of share units settled in shares (where legally permissible) after a three-year vesting period, making the value at vesting solely dependent on Swiss Re's share price development. Forfeiture and clawback provisions apply.\n\nThese changes increase employees' exposure to business performance volatility, and alignment with shareholder interests as well as Swiss Re's long-term risk profile. In-flight VAI awards (ie awarded in 2022 and before) are not impacted by these changes.\n\nComprehensive details on the DSP design will be provided in the 2022 Compensation Report to be published in 2023.",

        "page_content": "## Long-term incentive: LSP\n\n## Purpose\n\nThe purpose of the Leadership Share Plan (LSP) is to provide an incentive for Swiss Re's senior management (including the members of the Group EC) to achieve sustainable company performance over the long term. The LSP is a discretionary, forward-looking instrument awarded to incentivise decision-making that is also in the shareholders' interest. The design of the LSP aims to:\n\n- \u00b7 Direct participants' energies on earnings, capital efficiency and Swiss Re's position against peers, all of which are critical to sustain shareholder value creation.\n- \u00b7 Focus participants on long-term forward-looking business growth.\n- \u00b7 Attract and retain individuals with exceptional skills.\n- \u00b7 Provide competitive compensation that rewards long-term performance.\n\n## Changes implemented for performance year 2021\n\nAs of 2021 grants, the Leadership Performance Plan (LPP) was renamed to LSP and the design was amended globally. Key changes included a harmonisation of vesting factors for all performance conditions and the introduction of a cap in case of negative absolute Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance even if Swiss Re meets or exceeds the relative TSR peer group performance (cap of 100% for relative TSR Performance Share Units/ PSUs). To increase alignment of employees with shareholder interests, the LSP also extends to employees below senior management who may receive Share Units (SUs) without performance conditions, or a combination of PSUs and SUs.\n\n## Design\n\nGrant levels are determined based on multiple factors including the role being performed and market benchmarks. The size of the LSP pool is reviewed each year in the context of sustainable business performance, affordability and market competitiveness, and funded as part of the Group's total variable compensation pool.\n\n## Leadership Share Plan design for senior management\n\nAt the grant date, the award value is split equally into three underlying PSU components for senior management (including Group EC members). For other eligible employees, the award value is either split into 50% PSUs and 50% SUs or granted in 100% SUs. A valuation by a third party is used to determine the number of PSUs to be granted.\n\nThe vesting period, during which performance is measured, is three years. For LSP awards granted to Group EC members and other key executives, the duration of the LSP is five years, comprising a three-year vesting and performance measurement period and an additional two-year holding period.\n\nAt the end of the three-year measurement period, PSUs and SUs will be settled in shares where legally permissible. Forfeiture and clawback provisions apply in a range of events as defined in the LSP plan rules. Swiss Re also allows for LSP participants to have shares sold or automatically settled on a net basis as applicable, to cover statutory tax and social security liabilities that may arise.\n\n<!-- image -->",

For the ROE performance condition, the Board of Directors introduced a more demanding target in line with the externally communicated target, which makes the LSP more challenging overall.\n\nThese changes apply to all LSP participants and no changes are made to in-flight plan cycles.

        "page_content": "## Summary\n\nSwiss Re's climate-related financial disclosures aim to improve investors' and other stakeholders' ability to appropriately assess and price climate-related risk and opportunities in Swiss Re's re/insurance business, investment activities and operations. 1\n\nSwiss Re has a long-standing commitment to sustainable, long-term value creation. The Group Sustainability Strategy applies to the entire re/insurance value chain with actionable goals and ambitions for the short and mid term (2030) as well as for the long term (2050). 2 'Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition' is one of three pillars of the Group's sustainability efforts. The Climate Action Plan (see page 155) guides Swiss Re in the implemen tation of the climate change mitigation ambition through re/insurance solutions.\n\nSwiss Re has been actively contributing to advancing the net-zero 3 transition for several years through its participation in various industry-wide and cross-industry forums that are shaping CO2 measurement standards and climate commitments. Additionally, Swiss Re's Group CEO Christian Mumenthaler acts as a co-chair of the WEF Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders.\n\n## Managing risks related to climate change\n\n- \u00b7 Property re/insurance against natural catastrophes is one of Swiss Re's core business areas and is exposed to physical risk from climate change. As policy terms and pricing are renegotiated annually, Swiss Re continuously adapts its pricing models to the most recent loss experience and scientific evidence relating to all major risk factors. This includes the impact of climate change, but it is not the most dominant risk factor.\n- \u00b7 Other re/insurance portfolios of Swiss Re such as life & health or agriculture are also exposed to physical risk from climate change. However, only certain sub-segments of the agriculture reinsurance book are affected and are controlled through annual renewal of assumptions, pricing and policy terms. In l i f e  & h e a l t h , more frequent and intense heatwaves, air pollution from wildfires and vector-borne diseases are the most pronounced risks related to climate change. However, climate change is only one of many risk drivers, some of which can contribute to lower mortality and morbidity rates. The risks are mitigated through systematic review processes\n\nfor mortality assumptions based on the latest available scientific evidence.\n\n- \u00b7 It is Swiss Re's view that the transition to a low-carbon economy is not likely to present a significant financial risk for its re/insurance business . Swiss Re expects that the associated risks can be managed effectively, primarily through the annual renewal of contracts and formal processes to review underwriting assumptions based on the most recent historic loss experience. Furthermore, the climate-related policies of Swiss Re's advanced ESG Risk Framework ensure that risks associated with transactions are identified, assessed and addressed.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re's dedicated approach to managing investment-related climate risk involves the systematic monitoring of the carbon intensity of its government bond, corporate bond, listed equity and parts of the real estate portfolio. For the corporate bond and listed equity portfolios as well as parts of the real estate portfolio, Swiss Re also tracks related forward-looking indicators, such as temperature scores.\n\nThe Alliance is made up of over 100 CEOs from the world's largest corporations who have committed to net-zero emissions in their own operations and across their value chains by 2050. Christian Mumenthaler represented the Alliance at COP26, where he met with public sector decision makers and reiterated the business community's willingness to support more ambitious government targets to tackle climate change.\n\n- \u00b7 In 2021, Swiss Re initiated a pilot study to assess the impact of different climate change scenarios on underwriting and investment activities. This pilot is still ongoing. The results for property natural catastrophe re/insurance suggest that the projected increases of annual expected losses by 2050 do not exceed the increase of insured weather-related losses over the past three decades, which have already been shaped by the ongoing climate processes (including anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability). The focus for property and other short-tail lines of business remains unchanged: Swiss Re ensures that current risk views reflect all relevant risk drivers including climate change.\n\n- 2 You can read more about the Group Sustainability Strategy in the Sustainability Report 2021\n- 3 Net-zero emissions means that for every tonne of CO2 that cannot be avoided, a tonne needs to be permanently removed from the atmosphere through so-called carbon removal approaches.",

This segment is expected to grow strongly over the coming decades due to economic growth, urbanisation and the expected rise in climate-related risks.\n- \u00b7 Its proprietary models help Swiss Re to provide innovative solutions against the physical risks of climate change. In 2021 for example, Swiss Re designed and reinsured crop cover for six million\n\nfarmers in India, created a simplified flood insurance product for US homeowners and structured the first catastrophe bond for the island nation of Jamaica.\n\n- \u00b7 The transition to a net-zero emissions economy offers business opportunities across a range of sectors such as power and energy, materials and processes, logistics and transport, as well as agroforestry and food. Swiss Re is well posi tioned to support this transition with re/insurance cover and it is particularly active in the power sector. In 2021, for example, Swiss Re wrote re/insurance for more than 9100 renewable energy generation facilities, which will help to avoid around 31 million tonnes of CO2\n\n## Accelerated path to net-zero CO2 emissions\n\nTackling climate change and advancing the energy transition is challenging. In line with the Paris Agreement, Swiss Re is committed to achieving net-zero emissions in its underwriting and investment activities as well as for operations :\n\n- \u00b7 Climate change is an element of the Group Sustainability Strategy and covers several of the additional assessment dimensions for determining the Group Annual Performance Incentive pool.\n- \u00b7 Standards to measure and disclose emissions are needed to advance the transition. Swiss Re is therefore a founding member of the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) and\n\n## Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures of the Financial Stability Board (TCFD)\n\nSwiss Re has played an active role in the TCFD since its creation by the Financial Stability Board, and began to implement the TCFD recommendations in the 2016 Financial Report. Since then, Swiss Re has continued to expand its climate-related disclosures structured along four pillars and seven principles for effective disclosure.\n\nthe Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance (AOA), and is taking a leading role in some of their working groups.\n\n\u00b7 Swiss Re has tightened its underwriting\n\npolicies relating to thermal coal as well\n\nas oil and gas and is committed to\n\ntransition its underwriting portfolios\n\nto net zero by 2050\n\n.\n\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re aspires to transition its investment portfolio to net-zero emissions by 2050 . For its corporate bond and listed equity portfolio as well as parts of the real estate portfolio, Swiss Re has set intermediate targets for 2025 on the base year 2018 and aims to fully exit from coal-based assets by 2030.\n- emissions. Swiss Re provided parametric insurance solutions against revenue shortfall of solar and wind farms in Vietnam. In Germany, Swiss Re wrote re/insurance for the construction of the 476 MW offshore wind farm Baltic Eagle and the new transmission line S\u00fcdLink. The latter is key to transfer renewable energy from the north to the industrialised south.\n- \u00b7 Green, social and sustainability bonds play a key role in financing the transition to a net-zero economy . By the end of 2021, Swiss Re has reached around 96% of its USD 4 billion target for such bonds.\n\n\u00b7 Swiss Re has committed to\n\nnet-zero\n\nemissions in its operations by 2030\n\n.\n\n- To achieve this target, the company will 'Do our best, remove the rest' under the new CO2NetZero Programme. The focus of the programme is on emission reductions that are incentivised by a Carbon Steering Levy - an internal carbon price of USD 100-200 per tonne of CO2. The levy also provides the funds to compensate any unavoided emissions through carbon removal solutions. For example, those provided by Swiss Re's new partner Climeworks.\n\n| Governance             | Strategy                                                      | Risk management                                                      | Metrics and targets                                                |\n|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| A) Board oversight     | A)  Description of  climate-related  risks and  opportunities | A)  Processes for  identifying and  assessing  climate-related risks | A)   Metrics to assess  climate- related  risks and  opportunities |\n| B)  Management's  role | B)  Impact of  climate-related   risks and  opportunities     | B)   Process for  managing  climate-related  risks                   | B)   Scope 1, 2 and 3  greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions             |\n| Source: TCFD           | C)  Resilience of  strategy in  climate-related  scenarios    | C)   Integration into  overall risk  management                      | C)  Targets to manage  climate-related  risks and  opportunities   |",

This framework includes developing, enhancing, implementing and monitoring the Group Sustainability Strategy. In 2021, Swiss Re further embedded climate change considerations in the Business Units and Group Functions and worked on quantifying its climate performance. For a detailed overview of the Board of Directors' oversight and the management's role in sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities, including climate change, see the Corporate Governance section of the Financial Report on page 78. Sustainability and climaterelated governance in particular is covered on page 83.\n\nClimate-related topics are discussed at various governance levels. See pages 84-85 of the Financial Report for climate-related focus areas of the Board of Directors and the Group Executive committees in 2021. Selected climaterelated focus topics addressed during the year include:\n\n## Board of Directors committee meetings:\n\n- \u00b7 The Finance and Risk Committee reviewed the impact of climate change on the various underwriting portfolios with a focus on natural catastrophes and secondary perils for natural catastrophe insurance, and climate change litigation for casualty. They also assessed new risk transfer opportunities arising from climate change and the associated underwriting risks.\n- \u00b7 The Investment Committee received an update on the Responsible Investment climate action approach highlighting the Engagement Framework for listed equity, emissions reduction targets for Swiss Re's sub-portfolio and forward-looking indicators to measure the alignment of Swiss Re's portfolio to a 1.5\u00b0C world.\n\n## Group Executive Committee (Group EC) meetings:\n\n- \u00b7 During COP26, Swiss Re leaders met with the Swiss Re Strategic Council, a body of renowned external advisors, to discuss the challenges of climate change and the implications of governments', investors' and clients' respective net-zero strategies. Seven external subject matter experts joined the Swiss Re Strategic Council for two days of exchange.\n\n## Group Sustainability Council (GSC) meetings:\n\n- \u00b7 Climate-related discussions and endorsements in the GSC in 2021 included: the question of how to deal with insurance for hard-to-abate sectors across lines of business; addressing data limitations for measuring the carbon footprint of the underwriting portfolios, including Swiss Re's engagement with the NZIA on this topic (see 'Several steps to align the underwriting portfolio with the Paris Agreement', page 181); and Swiss Re's approach for re/insurance of nature and technology-based carbon removal and storage solutions.\n\n## Climate change and sustainabilityrelated KPIs linked to compensation\n\nClimate criteria are assessment dimensions for determining Swiss Re's Group Annual Performance Incentive pool.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFind out more on page 138 in the Compensation chapter of the Financial Report",

Mitigating climate risk and advancing the energy transition is therefore a core pillar of its sustainability strategy. Swiss Re is committed to reducing its carbon footprint and becoming net-zero in its operations by 2030. For underwriting and investment activities, Swiss Re is committed to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nRe/insurance protection against natural catastrophes is one of Swiss Re's core businesses and key risks. In 2021, premiums for natural catastrophe covers amounted to USD 3.9 billion, or about 22% of total premiums written. 1 This shows the importance clients place on obtaining re/insurance protection against natural catastrophes. The market is expected to see strong growth due to general economic growth, urbanisation in emerging markets as well as increased physical risks arising from climate change (see Opportunities related to physical risks, page 163). In addition, the difference between insured and total economic losses remains elevated, not only in emerging markets.\n\n## Swiss Re's Climate Action Plan\n\nBuilding on the Group Sustainability Strategy and commitments and initiatives of recent years, the Climate Action Plan combines three objectives:\n\n- 1.  Become the leading re/insurance company on physical climate risk.\n- 2.  Become a leading provider of re/insurance solutions for lowcarbon transition opportunities.\n- 3.  Build partnerships to develop scalable solutions to mitigate and adapt to climate change.\n\nAs the Climate Action Plan indicates, understanding the risks posed by climate change as well as identifying the potential to create and adapt suitable products and services for clients continue to be priorities for Swiss Re.\n\nIn view of the significance of climate change for the re/insurance business, Swiss Re has developed a Climate Action Plan to support private and public-sector clients, while profitably growing its business. The Climate Action Plan serves as Swiss Re's climate strategy.",

They can:\n\n- \u00b7 Influence modelling and pricing of weather-related natural perils\n- \u00b7 Impact the insurability of risks exposed to extreme weather events\n- \u00b7 Reduce/disrupt operations\n\n## Pricing of weather-related perils in property re/insurance\n\nClimate change will impact the frequency and severity of weather-related natural catastrophes. Consequently, Swiss Re's modelling and pricing of insurance risks need to be adjusted on a regular basis. Based on its proprietary loss modelling framework, Swiss Re is investigating how long-term scenario analysis can inform risk views for underwriting decisions today (see page 165).\n\nThis framework allows Swiss Re to calculate the annual expected losses (AEL) and loss-frequency distributions of major natural catastrophes. The weather-related perils with the largest AEL for property re/insurance at present are disclosed on page 180 (North Atlantic hurricane, US tornado, Japanese cyclone, European windstorm and European flood). Furthermore, the geographic distribution and peril split of Swiss Re's annual expected natural catastrophe losses for property insurance are shown in the figure on the right. The largest contribution to Swiss Re's AEL for the most material weather-related perils comes from the North America region (50%), mainly dominated by hurricane risk. Asia accounts for 18% of the AEL, with a significant contribution from typhoon risk. EMEA, where the major driver is European winter storms, and Latin America contribute with 15%, and 9%, respectively.\n\n## Gross annual expected property re/insurance loss for weather-related natural catastrophes\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nAs a percentage of most material perils in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia and Oceania (all numbers have been rounded).",

However, for both property and agriculture lines of business, Swiss Re's models show that with the current climate, the dominant factor for Swiss Re's weather-related risk exposure remains climate variability, affecting both the frequency and severity of extreme events in all regions. This is expected to remain the case both in the short and medium term (ie 2025 and\n\n2030), in line with the most recent scientific findings from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 1\n\nSwiss Re closely monitors climatic trends and other macro risk factors that are potentially material for the insurance industry over various time horizons.

        "page_content": "Confidence about observed and future climate trends is highest for risks related to the increase in global temperatures . For example, the melting of glaciers and ice caps as well as thermal expansion of water in warmer temperatures are leading to rising sea levels . In turn, this can directly increase the magnitude of storm surges , a long-term risk for coastal regions. To date, the rise in sea levels has been relatively slow and will likely remain so in the near future, allowing time for measures to mitigate the risk of coastal flooding.\n\nSwiss Re manages its exposure to sea level rise by developing up-to-date risk models and by managing its risk accumulation in the most exposed areas to ensure a well-diversified underwriting portfolio. Thanks to high-resolution data, Swiss Re's Global Storm Surge Zones help the company and its clients to pinpoint storm surge risks globally in a quantitative manner. The insurance impact for the property line of business is evaluated to be low to medium and localised in coastal and flooding zones (see the case study on sea level rise in the Swiss Re TCFD report 2020, page 156).\n\nAnother outcome of climate change for which there is high confidence is increased temperature extremes, which have brought longer and/or more frequent heatwaves, droughts and periods of water scarcity. Heatwaves affect agriculture, workforce productivity, infrastructure, water resources, health and mortality. In addition,\n\nhot and dry conditions exacerbate drought and wildfire risk , as seen in different regions in recent years, including California, Southern Europe and Australia. These perils have severe consequences for exposures in the wildland-urban interface.\n\nIn general, wildfire risk and other so-called frequency perils mostly affect direct insurers. Losses from such events often remain below the retention levels of property reinsurance programmes. Reinsurers are exposed to frequency perils mainly through aggregate excess of loss structures, event excess of loss structures that have a low attachment point and proportional treaties. Swiss Re has actively de-risked its portfolio of aggregate excess of loss covers in the last two years because of inadequate pricing. Overall, Swiss Re considers the natural catastrophe re/insurance market a healthy risk pool, and a growth opportunity subject to risk commensurate pricing (see Opportunities, page 163).\n\nRising temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more moisture , thus (on average) increasing the severity and frequency of rainfall events (including tropical cycloneinduced rainfall), which in turn is expected to amplify the flood risk. However, the rainfallflood link is complex. Furthermore, flood risk is also impacted by other factors such as soil sealing, urban flood protection, land-use changes and seasonal dependencies such as snow melt and soil moisture. Regional trends are already observable, but the property insurance impact for flood-related losses is limited due to the large protection gap for this peril.\n\nThere is lower confidence in the understanding of trends in modes of\n\nclimate variability , which encompasses atmospheric and oceanographic circulation changes. These modes affect, for example, the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones or European winter storms. While warmer sea surface temperatures will increase the probability of tropical cyclone formation and intensification, higher wind shear can offset this. These complex interactions introduce a confidence barrier that renders any insurance-related quantification of climate-change effects on high-severity perils like hurricanes very uncertain. Given their material impact, Swiss Re performs internal research and collaborates with leading scientists to tackle this challenge (see Resilience under different climate scenarios, page 165).\n\nWhile several climate change factors are beginning to affect the natural catastrophe risk landscape, Swiss Re expects weather risks to remain assessable by scientific methods . This means that loss models can continue to be updated in the future to assure adequate risk assessment of extreme weather events. The in-house development of risk models for weather-related perils ensures full modelling transparency and the ability to efficiently assess and update models if new scientific evidence becomes available (see Climate risk management, page 175).\n\nFurthermore, since most property re/insurance contracts have a duration of one year, updated risk views are quickly reflected in the pricing of natural catastrophe risks.\n\nRegarding the long-term time horizon to 2050, Swiss Re expects a need for adjustments to some weather risk models, based on evolving scientific knowledge. 1 Confidence is high that future research will provide sufficient guidance on the magnitude and direction of these adjustments.",

        "page_content": "## Impact on the insurability of risks exposed to extreme weather events\n\nAn increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events requires a rise in premium and can therefore restrict the affordability of property re/insurance in certain regions, especially in coastal areas.\n\nWhile there is significant uncertainty associated with climate projections, especially when it comes to storms making landfall, increases in the frequency and severity of tropical storms are likely. Climate variability is expected to remain the dominant factor in the near term. In the longer term (2050), a rise in sea levels will lead to non-linear increases in storm surge risk for coastal areas. Additionally, warmer temperatures will increase the severity of rainfall events that may increase flood risk.\n\nAffordability of insurance is an issue arising from climate change. It is expected that re/insurance premiums will need to rise to cover extreme weather risks. If this rise remains modest, then re/insurance protection remains economically viable and the overall premium volume will potentially grow. Larger increases, however, may be pushing re/insurance prices for certain highly exposed risks beyond the limits of economic viability. This is particularly relevant for areas with inadequate construction planning and development. In addition, the timing of actions against increased climate-related claims is of crucial importance. For example, if measures to exclude a particular risk are taken too early, viable business opportunities will be missed. If measures are taken too late, the consequence may be higher-than-expected claims.\n\nInsurability depends on the random nature of a risk. If risks increase to a level at which losses are certain and predictable, then insurance is not the right instrument to address such systematic changes to a landscape. For example, if there is permanent flooding due to rising sea levels, insurance is not the appropriate financing mechanism to protect assets.\n\nFinally, the overall size of the re/insurance market will depend on future economic growth rates.\n\nIn line with independent external studies, Swiss Re's assessment through its Economics of Climate Adaptation studies have shown that climate adaptation measures need to be taken in many regions to limit expected increases in natural catastrophe damage, thereby, ensuring the economic viability of re/insurance in the future. The implementation of cost-effective adaptation measures against climate change requires active collaboration between public and private sector actors, including re/insurers.\n\n## Impact on other lines of business Agriculture insurance\n\ntypically covers against perils like hail, drought, excess rain and frost, but the extent of covers provided diverges across markets. Climate change will impact agriculture insurance, but this is limited to the sub-portfolios of crop and forestry, which are mostly exposed to hail and drought. As global climate models show clearly increasing trends for drought and frost, but not for hail and excess rain, less than half of Swiss Re's total agriculture book and only around 45% of its total agriculture AEL are susceptible to climate change.\n\nWhile hail is also an important peril for Swiss Re's agriculture insurance book, constituting roughly 40% of premiums, there is low confidence on future changes on hail activity driven by climate change in most regions.\n\nThe impact on Swiss Re's agriculture book will be mitigated by several factors:\n\n- \u00b7 Agriculture insurance is a short-tail business, which allows costing and portfolio composition to be adjusted annually.\n- \u00b7 Climate change that has manifested itself to date is reflected in historical losses, which are the main basis for costing business, and Swiss Re is observing increasing rates in re/insurance pricing.\n- \u00b7 Swiss Re will continue efforts to enhance forward-looking modelling.\n\nNevertheless, from 2010 to 2020, realised losses have exceeded expectations in almost every year. Very likely, part of this gap can be attributed to trend effects due to climate change. In 2020, Swiss Re took corrective actions to better account for climate change-driven trend effects in the costing methodology. This involved adjusting deal-specific historical performance to today's climate, aiming for a much more accurate and representative risk assessment.",

        "page_content": "Life and health re/insurance is also influenced by climate change. The most pronounced risks for health are heatwaves, air pollution from wildfires and vector-borne diseases. Without mitigation action, mortality rates and healthcare costs could rise, leading to higher claims costs than anticipated. More severe heatwaves can increase mortality, particularly among persons with cardiovascular diseases. Heatwaves will extend to regions previously not affected. This will increase the share of the world's population impacted by such conditions.\n\nThe general rise of temperature and increased humidity is another area of concern. This combination enables vector-borne diseases to enter new areas. Climate change will extend the transmission season and geographical range for many infectious diseases. Lyme disease, avian influenza, meningitis, dengue fever and other tropical bacterial and viral infections are therefore projected to rise.\n\nSevere drought conditions can lead to more wildfires, which cause air pollution. Such air pollution can extend to regions far from the fire itself and lead to deteriorating health conditions and increasing mortality experience.\n\nScientific evidence quantifying the impact of climate-related heatwaves, air pollution and vector-borne diseases on health and mortality outcomes is still limited. Swiss Re follows the scientific discussion and incorporates new evidence into its mortality assumptions on a regular basis (see Climate risk management, page 175). Available research suggests that in Swiss Re's main Life & Health markets, extreme cold is currently a more substantial driver of mortality than extreme heat. Seasonal patterns in Swiss Re's mortality claims show a significantly higher burden in winter months compared to summer months. This suggests that a net adverse impact from climate change on mortality may only arise in the more distant future.\n\nFurthermore, the availability of mitigation measures (eg air purifiers, air cooling, in cre ased hydration) that would be affordable for the insured population of Swiss Re's key mortality portfolios in the US, UK, Canada and Australia will limit the effects of warmer temperatures and ex treme heat. How climate change will play out in conjunction with other key adverse trends such as increases in unhealthy behaviours or obesity is an area of uncertainty.\n\nThere are many other risk factors to consider that could be secondary consequences of other activities undertaken to adapt to climate change. For instance, action to limit air pollution could lead to improving mortality and morbidity outcomes; but conversely, the increased usage of air cooling could place greater stress on electricity grids in times of extreme heat and lead to excess mortality when power failures occur. These secondary consequences are particularly difficult to model and predict, suggesting that a more broad-brush approach, utilising Swiss Re's existing framework around long-term mortality trend assumptions, is more appropriate and avoids spurious accuracy.\n\n## Swiss Re's own operations\n\nAccording to Swiss Re's in-house catastrophe loss models, severe weather risks are potentially of importance for some operations, mainly in Florida and on the northeastern coast of the US. However, even assuming an extreme climate change scenario, Swiss Re does not expect any of these office locations to be exposed to risk levels that would undermine their economic viability. Additionally, robust and regularly tested business continuity plans covering all locations are in place to mitigate the risk of climate-related disruptions (see Climate risk management, page 175).",

        "page_content": "## Transition risks\n\nOverall, it is Swiss Re's view that the transition to a low-carbon economy is not likely to present a significant financial risk for its re/insurance business. It is expected that the associated risks can be managed effectively, due to the formal processes to review underwriting assumptions based on the most recent historic loss experiences and annual renewal of contracts.\n\nTransition risks may arise as a result of the extensive policy, legal, technological and market changes that are required to make the transition to a low-carbon and, ultimately, a net-zero economy. For a re/insurer, financial risks arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy are mainly linked to the potential re-pricing of carbon-intensive financial assets (see Investment activities, page 169), and the speed at which any such re-pricing might occur. To a lesser extent, re/insurers may also need to adapt to potential impacts on the liability side of their business.\n\nSwiss Re has assessed the most relevant transition risks that may potentially affect the re/insurance business:\n\n- \u00b7 Policy and legal risks\n- \u00b7 Technology risks\n- \u00b7 Market and reputational risks\n\n## Policy and legal risks\n\nAs the move towards achieving a net-zero emissions economy by mid-century or earlier gains momentum in both the public and private sector, material policy-triggered changes are expected for the real economy in areas such as power and energy, materials and processes, logistics and transportation, and agroforestry and land-use practices. Such policy changes may include regulations to increase energy and material efficiency, mandates to rapidly scale up renewable energy and clean mobility, the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, the introduction of carbon pricing, policies addressing land-use change and agricultural practices, as well as the scaling up of carbon removal technologies. This requires a solid understanding of the related policy and legal risks as well as the proactive management of related risks and opportunities. Certain policy risks might also influence the risk quality of some insured assets in the mid to long term, due to factors such as increased cost pressure and reduced asset maintenance.\n\n## Risks related to climate change litigation (CCL)\n\nSwiss Re identified CCL as an emerging risk over a decade ago and assessed its relevance. Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, the number of CCL cases has more than doubled. The activities are currently focused on the US, Europe and Australia, but they are spreading to other jurisdictions as well. While most of the cases are directed against governments and public entities, private companies are also increasingly being targeted. However, the majority of decisions in those litigation cases potentially relevant for insurers were made in favour of the defendants. Therefore, they have not led to significant claims for the re/insurance industry to date.\n\nSwiss Re has not faced any significant CCL claims in the past. Swiss Re expects the above trends to continue, and actively monitors and assesses CCL risks in its underwriting and research units. In particular, Swiss Re tracks advances in climate attribution science, CCL cases, regulatory changes and developments in legal concepts for different geographies, industries and lines of business in order to assess potential exposures under different scenarios.\n\n## Technology risks\n\nThe re/insurance sector is likely to be impacted by the technological transition in two ways:\n\n- 1. New or rapidly developing technologies by definition do not have loss histories and thus may be challenging to price accurately. Insurers need to develop possible loss scenarios and the related expenses. Once these are developed and tested, new technologies are likely to present the sector with an opportunity for growth. Offshore wind projects, for example, have developed into such growth opportunities (see Climaterelated opportunities, pages 163-164).\n- 2. New low-carbon technologies are likely to gradually displace traditional, fossil fuel-based ones. Power generation, for example, will shift to wind and solar farms delivering intermittent power. This could affect other elements of power systems that had originally been designed for stable base load electricity delivered by fossil fuel power plants.\n\nAs another example, the global motor vehicle inventory is currently shifting away from internal combustion engines towards electric engines to reduce carbon emissions. This development entails the implementation of a variety of new technologies, from new lightweight materials to advanced battery systems. This will likely change loss patterns for re/insurers.\n\nHowever, while the automotive industry is undergoing significant change, the impact on re/insurance portfolios is expected to be gradual. It will take years for new technologies to penetrate the motor fleets. In addition, as motor insurance contracts are renewed annually, pricing can be adapted as re/insurers gain experience in underwriting, loss adjustment and claims handling. Swiss Re's Automotive and Mobility Solutions team is creating a comprehensive framework for vehicle risk scoring. The framework covers all specific aspects of vehicle technology from mechanical components such as tires, suspensions and brakes, to advanced driver assistance systems. It also includes the topic of risk assessments for different types of electric and autonomous vehicles.",

        "page_content": "The motor transition does not affect insurers and reinsurers to the same extent. According to Swiss Re's sigma database, in 2020 motor insurance represented approximately 41% of global property and casualty direct premiums written, but for the reinsurance sector and Swiss Re the share is well below 20%.\n\nTo address some of the residual transition risk, Swiss Re has started to develop a carbon risk steering mechanism. Its key component will be a carbon risk model designed to measure the carbon intensity and associated risks embedded in the re/insurance business. For further\n\ninformation about the mechanism and related policies, see Climate risk management, page 176, and Climate metrics and targets, page 181.\n\n## Market and reputational risks\n\nWith policy, legal and technological changes as a backdrop, consumer and investment preferences will further shift toward less carbon-intensive products and services over time. Changes in market volumes will be reflected in the demand for insurance. In addition, to support their decision-making, investors and other stakeholders will expect greater transparency and more information\n\nregarding re/insurers' exposure to emission-intensive sectors as well as their contribution to low emissions-related risk transfer solutions.\n\nCompanies whose disclosures are misleading or overstate their climate efforts - so-called greenwashing - can also sustain reputational damage that could affect Swiss Re directly or through its liabilities through CCL. Finally, particularly in fossil fuel-dependent societies, a late and sudden transition without appropriate mitigation measures may result in setbacks such as social unrest, leading to an overall market decline.\n\n## Non-investment transition risks for the real economy and their relevance for the re/insurance industry\n\n| Transition risks

Developing corresponding products and services is a core part of the Group Sustainability Strategy and Climate Action Plan. Through its products, services and risk insights, Swiss Re pursues two complementary objectives: adapting to the effects of climate change and supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy.\n\n## Business solutions that tackle physical climate risk\n\nExamples of recent deals that tackle physical climate risk include:\n\nProviding crop insurance for six million farmers in India: More than 6 million farmers in West Bengal, India, can now look forward to having better coverage for their crops, as the state launched its first fully subsidised technology-driven crop insurance scheme. The Bangla Shasya Bima scheme is unique in that it adopts the Crop Health Factor as the underlying parameter: it uses remote sensing technology to measure and combine various indicators such as rain and vegetation to assess the health of the crop. Swiss Re helped review the product design and is also the lead reinsurer of the scheme.\n\n## Partnering to monitor flood risk: Swiss Re's\n\nRapid Damage Assessment (RDA) supports claims managers to take faster and more accurate decisions in events such as tropical cyclones and floods. RDA uses a combination of event data, natural catastrophe models, data enrichment and AI algorithms on high resolution aerial and synthetic aperture radar satellite imagery to derive property-level damage insights, ultimately improving the loss-adjustment process. Swiss Re continuously enriches its existing datasets through partnerships. One such partnership made in 2021 is with ICEYE, whose radar-based technology satellites can peer through cloud cover, volcanic ash and hurricanes to measure how floods and other natural catastrophes are impacting specific regions as they occur. Swiss Re's experts can then use the\n\n## Opportunities related to physical risks\n\nA recent sigma report by the Swiss Re Institute projects that the global property insurance market is to grow more strongly than the overall economy until 2040. 1 While economic growth and increasing urbanisation in emerging markets will contribute the majority of additional premiums over the next two decades, 20% are due to increased physical risk because of climate change. At the same time, the share of uninsured losses, remains high. 2\n\nRDA enriched with ICEYE data to calculate the impact of the flooding across clients' portfolios within days.\n\n## Providing flood protection for US\n\nhomeowners: Swiss Re has worked with actuarial consultant Milliman and the firm's insurance advisory and rating organisation, Appleseed, to develop QuickFlood - a simplified flood insurance product for lower risk flood zones in the US - based on Swiss Re's proprietary flood models. Appleseed obtains state-by-state regulatory approval for QuickFlood on behalf of Swiss Re clients, reducing regulatory risk and helping them to adopt and deploy the product quickly. To date, the overall flood solution supports up to 220 000 flood policies, helping to mitigate climate risk.\n\n## Protecting China's farmers from weather\n\nrisks: Located in South China, Guangdong Province cultivates a large variety of agricultural products, but is exposed to heavy rainfall and typhoons. Swiss Re's Agriculture Insurance Risk Monitoring Platform (AIRMP) leverages big data and machine learning to support local insurers with product design, actuarial analysis, pay-out calculations and product management. As of the end of 2021, Swiss Re developed insurance for 20 new agricultural products. The cover includes perils such as typhoons, extreme temperatures, strong winds and droughts. Additionally, Swiss Re provides reinsurance capacity for products developed via the platform, thus further helping to close the protection gap and boost high-quality development of agricultural insurance in Guangdong.\n\nSwiss Re's re/insurance products against natural catastrophes help our clients to cope effectively with current climate risks. The same applies to Swiss Re's weather insurance solutions. In addition, Swiss Re undertakes special efforts to help expand re/insurance protection by focusing on non-traditional clients (in particular from the public sector), underdeveloped markets and innovative risk transfer instruments.\n\nHelping Jamaica become more resilient to natural catastrophes: Swiss Re Capital Markets acted as structuring agent and bookrunner for the first catastrophe bond issued to solely benefit the island nation of Jamaica. The bond provides accelerated economic relief of up to USD 185 million in the case that Jamaica is impacted by a tropical cyclone that meets certain parametric minimum central pressure thresholds. The collateral, meanwhile, is held by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, thereby funding development projects for middle and low-income countries.\n\nHelping corporate clients quantify their physical climate risks: Many of Swiss Re's corporate clients increasingly need to assess their exposure to physical climate risks in order to safeguard their long-term business interests and answer to stakeholders, investors, customers and regulators. By combining Swiss Re's forward-looking climate models for precipitation and sea level rise with flood and storm surge zones, Swiss Re's Climate Risk Solutions can help clients quantify their exposure to physical climate risks, supporting their long-term planning and decision-making. The offering includes in-depth analysis of natural catastrophe impact for a customer's identified peril scenarios as well as mitigation and risk transfer options.\n\nRead more about these solutions in the Sustainability Report, pages 22-27 or on the Swiss Re Corporate Solutions website.\n\n- 1 Swiss Re Institute sigma No 4/2021, More risk: the changing nature of P&C insurance opportunities to 2040.\n- 2 See Swiss Re Institute, Resilience Index 2021: a strong growth recovery, but less resilient world economy and www.sigma-explorer.com.",

New capital spending for low-emission assets is estimated to be 3% of global GDP, or a cumulative USD 105 trillion, until 2050 to achieve net-zero. This is on top of current spending of USD 170 trillion. 1 For the power sector alone, the International Energy Agency estimates that achieving net-zero emissions could create a cumulative\n\n## Business solutions that tackle energy transition risks\n\nExamples of recent deals that tackle energy transition risks include:\n\nFacultative casualty reinsurance for a global client: For the past decade Swiss Re has supported a global insurance company with facultative reinsurance cover for its renewable energy portfolio. This enabled the client to extend its market-leading property, engineering and marine renewable energy insurance covers to include casualty and thus become a one-stop-shop for renewable energy insurance. Initially, the portfolio consisted primarily of European wind farms, but over the last five years the scope has broadened to include other regions as well as photovoltaic solar farms and battery storage systems. In 2021, Swiss Re reinsured over 290 installations. For simpler projects, Swiss Re automatically provides construction and operationrelated covers, while more complex risks are underwritten individually.\n\n## Advancing the energy transition in India:\n\nSwiss Re helped a renewable energy provider in India to consolidate insurance cover for its entire portfolio of solar (80%) and wind (20%) energy plants across India, supporting its ambition to build 25 GW of renewable energy generation capacity by 2025. The scope of the coverage is to provide operational cover (property damage and business interruption) for all of its existing solar\n\nUSD 27 trillion market opportunity for manufacturers of wind turbines, solar panels, lithium-ion batteries, electrolysers and fuel cells. 2 Realising the potential will require a strong contribution from private capital providers. While the announcement of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) in 2021 to commit USD 130 trillion 3 reflected an increasing engagement of the financial sector, more will be needed.\n\nSwiss Re is re/insuring renewable energy projects across all lines of business. In 2021, Swiss Re wrote property and engineering\n\nand wind power plants. Plants that are currently under construction will also be covered once they become operational.\n\nConnecting offshore wind energy to consumers in Germany: Swiss Re provides construction insurance to S\u00fcdLink, the largest renewable energy infrastructure project in Germany. An electrical superhighway, also called a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system, it runs completely underground over a distance of 700 kilometres. With a capacity of 4 GW, the S\u00fcdLink brings the electricity of ten large offshore windfarms to 10 million households. The project updates existing infrastructure and advances the renewable energy transition.\n\nImproving bankability of solar and wind farms in Vietnam: In 2021, Swiss Re provided several parametric reinsurance programmes that compensate the owners of solar and wind farms in Vietnam - and their investors - in case revenues fall short due to the variability of solar irradiation and wind. The reinsurance programme covers the same time period as the external financing provided by banks or other investors. By ensuring that the owners have stable revenues to meet their financing obligations, the cover enables them to execute the planned expansion of their solar and wind farms while addressing lenders' concerns over the impact of the solar irradiation and wind volatility on revenues. The parametric covers trigger a payment when solar\n\ncover for more than 9 100 renewable energy generation facilities which will help to avoid around 31 million tonnes of CO2 emissions. Swiss Re Corporate Solutions is a recognised market leader for offshore wind risks. Reinsurance enginee ring premiums from renewable energy power generation grew strongly by 17% per year over the past decade and accounted for 58% of total engineering premiums for power generation in 2021. Furthermore, through nature-based solutions, Swiss Re supports and enables investments in natural assets that support climate adaptation and mitigation.\n\nirradiation or wind conditions fall below a predefined level. This solution is an effective tool to mitigate the owners' and investors' risk exposure to solar irradiation and wind volatility, which to date has not been insurable by conventional insurance products. This in turn can unlock financing for the planned additional 41 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030, as drafted in Vietnam's latest power development plan to support the country's economic development. Once complete, these reinsured solar and wind power plants will provide electricity to more than 200 000 average households in Vietnam and help to avoid more than 300 000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year.\n\nEnabling a large wind farm in the Baltic Sea: Swiss Re Corporate Solutions wrote the lead share for the construction of the Baltic Eagle wind farm 30 km off the island of R\u00fcgen in Germany. The arrangement covers the construction phase and losses of revenue due to specific construction delays as well as property damages during the first year of operation. Reinsurance is also participating through several cedents. Manufacturing of the foundations starts in 2022, with the wind farm due to be commissioned in 2024. The 50 monopile foundations will be set into the seabed more than 40 metres below the surface. Each of the turbines will have a capacity of close to 10 MW resulting in a total of 476 GW. Once operational, the infrastructure will provide enough electricity to the German grid to power almost half a million households.\n\n3\n\nAmount of finance committed to achieving 1.5\u00b0C now at scale needed to deliver the transition, GAFANZ, 2021,\n\nhttps://www.gfanzero.com/press/amount-of-finance-committed-to-achieving-1-5c-now-at-scale-needed-to-deliver-the-transition/.",

        "page_content": "## Resilience under different climate scenarios\n\nSwiss Re does not consider climate change to be a single factor posing a fundamental threat to the resilience of its re/insurance business. For the peak exposures in property natural catastrophe re/insurance, the projected increases of AEL do not exceed historic trends, even for the most severe scenario. Climate change is one of many important risk drivers to take into consideration when shaping Swiss Re's business strategy. Therefore, a purely quantitative scenario analysis focusing on climate only is a limited instrument for driving today's decisions, particularly in short-tail lines of business such as property. A key condition for the ability to continue acting as an ultimate risk-taker is the regular update of natural catastrophe models and diversification with regard to regions, lines of business, sectors and clients.\n\nBelow are the results of Swiss Re's pilot scenario analysis for property natural catastrophe re/insurance and the evaluation of the usefulness of the analysis for driving strategic decisions relevant today. For life & health and casualty, the scenario analysis is more qualitative and still in progress.\n\n## Use of external scenarios\n\nSwiss Re uses scenarios of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) as a common narrative for the analysis for investment and underwriting portfolios. The NGFS scenarios incorporate different degrees of transition risks along different paths of global warming in an orderly, disorderly and hot house scenario. The NGFS scenarios are complemented by additional sources, as required. For physical climate risks in the natural catastrophe property portfolio, Swiss Re uses the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socio-Economic Pathway (SSP) scenarios adopted by the IPCC. 1 Differences of the projected physical impacts between RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in the near- to mid-term (ie until 2030) but also in the long-term (ie 2050) are minor, but a considerable divergence is expected for the second half of the 21st century. Furthermore, there is significant uncertainty within a single scenario (eg RCP 8.5), mainly caused by different modelling assumptions used in various climate models.\n\n## Casualty and life & health\n\nSwiss Re closely monitors the CCL landscape (see page 171), potential loss scenarios and their impact on Swiss Re's casualty book. For life & health, the available scientific research on the impact of climate change on health and mortality outcomes is still relatively limited to reliably inform scenario work. Furthermore, when considering the impact of climate change on health outcomes, other key variables also play a significant role. These include, but are not limited to, age, gender, health comorbidities and socioeconomic status (see Climate strategy, page 160).\n\n## Property natural catastrophe re/insurance\n\nIn accordance with TCFD guidelines, Swiss Re has carried out a long-term scenario analysis for property natural catastrophe re/insurance, which is the portfolio most exposed to physical climate risk (see box on the following two pages). The analysis computed the potential effects caused by climate change on the AEL for the two most material weatherrelated exposures in Swiss Re's property book, ie tropical cyclones in the US (TC US) and in Japan (TC JP). Three RCP scenarios and the latest available scientific insights were considered, while keeping everything else, including insured assets, constant. 2050 was chosen as the time horizon.\n\nOne of the goals was to find out if such scenario work can answer relevant current business steering questions, most notably:\n\n- 1. Has climate change already created physical risk hot spots in the current business landscape?\n- 2.  Does the current costing and underwriting practice capture the climate change impact, if material?\n- 3.  If so, does the risk appetite need to change in response to the existing physical or transition risks related to climate change?\n- 4.  Do any lines of business where the gradually accumulating impact of physical climate change risk over future decades require taking action today?\n- 5.  Does Swiss Re's risk management framework capture the impact of climate change adequately for key lines of business?",

        "page_content": "## Quantitative pilot scenario analysis for TC US and TC JP\n\nSwiss Re has conducted a quantitative scenario analysis in line with TCFD recommendations.\n\n## Transmission mechanism\n\nThe general transmission mechanism of physical climate change on property insurance risk includes likely changes of the frequency and/or severity of natural catastrophes, which can then translate into rising damages and property losses. The impact, however, varies across perils and regions and is subject to large uncertainties 1 (see also Climate strategy, page 158). Climate change influences hurricanes through increasing sea surface temperature, adding more energy particularly in the regions of the Atlantic, where hurricanes form and travel towards land. In addition, a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapour, which may increase tropical cyclone-induced rainfall or other extreme precipitation events. Furthermore, sea level rise will exacerbate storm-surge risk.\n\n## Findings\n\nSwiss Re chose a market portfolio for its analysis because it is a fair approximation of a global reinsurer's portfolio in view of all uncertainties. The portfolio was kept static to isolate the climate change effects from exposure growth due to economic development, insurance penetration or change in coverage conditions. The resulting estimations reveal that the AEL only increases substantially by 2050 in the NGFS 'hot house' scenario. See the following for scenario 1a strong warming, severe impact, RCP 8.5, 2 ie assuming the upper boundaries of the four parameters considered (tropical cyclone overall frequency, category 4-5 frequency, intensity and rain rate):\n\n- \u00b7 In scenario 1a, ie the 'hot house' scenario with the most extreme assumptions, AEL for TC US increase by close to 90% and 60% for TC JP. This translates into AEL annual growth of 2.2% and 1.6% for TC US and TC JP, respectively.\n- \u00b7 In scenario 1b, ie 'hot house' scenario parametrisation for TC frequency and severity of the median values under RCP 8.5, TC US and TC JP AEL are estimated to increase by far less with 16% and 9%, or an annual increase of 0.6% and 0.3%. Scenario 1b is considered to be the more realistic RCP 8.5 scenario versus 1a.\n- \u00b7 In the more benign scenarios 2 and 3, AEL are also estimated to increase by 16% for TC US and 9% for TC JP.\n- \u00b7 The loss-severity level of an event with an annual occurrence rate of 0.5% (200-year event) is estimated to increase by up to 30% for the most severe scenario 1a for TC US and 40% for TC JP, but only by around 7% in the other scenarios for TC US and 20% for TC JP.\n- \u00b7 Irrespective of the chosen RCP scenario (1b, 2, and 3), the quantified impacts by 2050 are quite similar, because the scenario uncertainties are overlapping.\n- 1 Knutson et al.

        "page_content": "These findings are consistent with similar analyses done by other industry players. The relative increases of 0.3%-0.6% per year are relatively small, compared to historic industry insured loss developments. For example, since the 1990s, insured weather-related natural catastrophe losses normalised by GDP (approximating a constant market portfolio) have increased by 80% according to sigma data. This is an increase of roughly 3% per year, which is higher than the anticipated increases in the most extreme scenario 1a.\n\n## Challenges and limitations\n\nThe ability to detect and connect weatherrelated losses to climate change effects remains low for most perils due to a gap in spatial and temporal scales of scientific climate models and insurance models for natural catastrophe risks. Each climate scenario has a large uncertainty range because there is only limited scientific consensus on how an increase in global temperature will translate into changes in frequency and severity of natural hazards. Therefore, the quantifications presented for different climate change scenarios on TC US and TC JP market portfolios should be treated as indicative.\n\nTC AEL for four scenarios vs today (USD billion and change in %, market portfolio)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nJapan\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n0\n\nTC loss frequency curve for four scenarios vs today (USD billion and % changes for 200-year losses, market portfolio)\n\n<!-- image -->",

        "page_content": "Based on today's understanding, the scenario pilot revealed that the expected climatic changes for TC US and TC JP over the next 30 years are manageable for Swiss Re. The company's risk view and risk appetite can be gradually adapted as new scientific insights become available over the investigated time horizon. Even under the most severe scenario, the projected changes do not exceed historic loss experience. However, when it comes to steering the business, such scenario analysis is of limited use in deriving concrete actions.\n\nLooking at climate effects in isolation, as in the scenario pilot above, means ignoring the other factors that will shape Swiss Re's future re/insurance book and thus also future AEL. These factors include, but are not limited to, strategy and underwriting risk appetite which can be redefined during the annual renewal process of property re/insurance business, market conditions, capital costs, insurance penetration, resilience of buildings or infrastructure against storms, and other climate adaptation measures. Since Swiss Re's re/insurance book and current AEL are the result of a complex interaction between all of these factors, any scenario analysis over the 2050 time horizon would have to consider all of them, in the process rendering the impact of climate change on the resulting AEL marginal. The AEL for Swiss Re's weather-related re/insurance book in 2050 will further depend both on its future market share and projections of the overall global property insurance market volume. Independent studies have shown a wide range for future business volumes, thus making long-term projections very challenging.\n\nThe complex dynamics become apparent when considering that over the next decades significant population growth is expected in Asia and Africa. At the same time, the population in Europe and North America is unlikely to grow considerably\n\nor may even start to decline, as projected by the United Nations Department of Economics and Social Affairs. Over the same time period, real GDP per capita is expected to increase by more than 45% in the United States and will likely more than double in China by 2050 based on Swiss Re estimates. Global urbanisation will increase from approximately 56% today to almost 70% by mid-century. These socio-economic dynamics will lead to vast changes of insured value distributions and the re/insurance landscape in general. From a re/insurance perspective, socio-economic dynamics will often overshadow slowly evolving climate trends and thus limit the decision-power of quantitative climate scenario analyses and stress tests in which only changes to climatic conditions of natural hazards are considered.\n\nLooking at the decision-relevant questions posed initially, the pilot scenario work has provided limited steering insight due to the limitations mentioned above. In view of the short-tail nature of property natural catastrophe business, there is little urgency to act for Swiss Re on its own already today. This obviously ignores adaptation and mitigation measures, as well as future loss development. While the projected increase of 0.3-0.6% per annum is small (1.6-2.2% in the most extreme scenario), ongoing climate change processes have been shaping today's risk landscape. For decisionrelevant analytics, it is important to understand whether today's risk assessment reflects the current climate (irrespective whether the changes are caused by climate change or natural variability) and whether current market prices reflect the risk level. It is also important that the company's risk management sufficiently ensures that the above two factors are respected. In this context, Swiss Re has invested significant effort over the past decade to embed climate change and other relevant risk drivers into key risk models and to model a present day/ near future risk landscape rather than relying on an average of the past five decades.\n\n## How Swiss Re ensures resilience of its property business in a changing climate\n\n- 1.  Diversification of insured natural hazards with regard to regions, lines of business, sectors and clients.\n- 2.  Flexible management and steering of weather-related exposure through limited duration of re/insurance contracts (typically one-year contracts for property insurance) as well as active portfolio steering (see Pricing of weather-related perils in property, page 156).\n- 3.  Regular updates of Swiss Re's in-house natural catastrophe models to ensure adequate costing of natural hazards for the current and near-term climate and socioeconomic environment.\n- 4.  A qualitative scenario process to assess the most material impacts of climatic and socio-economic trends that affect insured risks. This is supported by quantitative assessments on the likely range of expected changes to assess their materiality over different time horizons and emission pathways.\n\nQualitative scenarios help focus attention and modelling improvements on relevant factors that will affect the physical risk landscape. Relevant regional key risks and potential for risk reduction through adaptation were identified by IPCC in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). 1\n\nOn a societal level, Swiss Re's Economics of Climate Adaptation studies have shown that climate change can lead to an increase of economic losses in specific locations due to weather risks of up to 30% within the next 25 years. More importantly, economic development, urbanisation, higher population densities and asset concentrations in flood plains are expected to be the dominant factors in increasing weather-related economic losses. As these factors become more pronounced, the models will gradually factor in this trend, since they are updated and refined at regular intervals.",

        "page_content": "## Investment activities\n\nSwiss Re's investments in real-world activities and businesses are exposed to climate risks and opportunities. Swiss Re has been reporting climate-related information in line with TCFD recommen dations and providing insights into these risks and opportunities in its investment portfolio since 2016. The 2021 section includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Enhanced reporting on carbon emissions for the investment portfolio\n- \u00b7 Intermediate emission reduction targets aiming to achieve a net-zero investment portfolio by 2050\n- \u00b7 Active engagement with key companies across all industries\n- \u00b7 Measurement and monitoring of the trajectory to net zero and increasingly active management of potential stranded asset risks\n\nTo reflect the increased market focus on climate risks and opportunities, Swiss Re has embedded its approach into the Responsible Investing strategy in a structured manner (see also Sustainability Report, pages 40-48). Swiss Re Asset Management's 'climate action' supports its journey towards a net-zero emissions portfolio by 2050.\n\nIt consists of four steps to align the portfolio with a 1.5\u00b0C world: set targets, take actions, measure and report. Climate change is a global challenge and should be addressed as such, ie it needs to be mitigated through real-world transition. For this reason, collaborating with investee companies via 'Financing transition' and 'Engagement' play key roles in Swiss Re's approach.\n\nAs outlined in the 2021 climate publication Responsible Investments - Our roadmap to net zero, achieving a low-carbon emissions portfolio via divestments makes only a limited contribution to the global fight against climate change. When Swiss Re supports its investee companies to tackle the challenge, the benefits are manifold: not only are the investment portfolio and the investee companies better protected, but so are Swiss Re's underwriting portfolios, as insurance solutions for some of these companies are provided at the same time. Divestments can still be used as a tool to reduce the risk of stranded assets to an acceptable level.\n\n## Swiss Re Asset Management's climate action approach:\n\n## Climate action\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Set targets\n\n## Take actions\n\n## Measure\n\n## Report\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSet targets to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050\n\nActively manage climate risk & support real economy transition\n\n## Transition risk\n\nIn the area of transition risks, the key risks faced by asset owners is that a changing policy environment may result in a specific company or a particularly exposed industry becoming a stranded asset in investment portfolios, ie the devaluation of investments driven by unfavourable changes, such as increased taxes and/or new regulations.\n\nIn alignment with Swiss Re's commitment made as a founding member of the AOA, it publicly released intermediate climate targets in March 2021 to be achieved by 2025. These targets aim to align the investment portfolio with a 1.5\u00b0C world making the transition to a low carbon economy an implicit part of the investment philosophy. At the end of 2021, Swiss Re's investment portfolio runs a more limited risk when it comes to an 'orderly' scenario. But given the economy itself has not yet aligned to a 1.5\u00b0C world, the exposure to transition risk may change over time, in particular in\n\nMeasure & monitor trajectory towards net zero\n\nInform share- & stakeholders transparently\n\ncarbon-heavy industries. Ongoing monitoring and active risk management support Swiss Re in maintaining and improving its status over time.\n\nUnder 'Sub-portfolio', Swiss Re provides specific carbon reduction targets for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolio as well as the Swiss and German real estate portfolio. Based on AOA's latest assessment, the IPCC's 1.5\u00b0C pathway implies an emission reduction range for the targeted asset classes of 22-32% for the period from 2020 to 2025.\n\nSwiss Re has set a 2025 reduction target of -35% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolio with the base year 2018, taking into account its financing transition, engagement and sector targets. This gives Swiss Re the tools to work with the investee companies towards emissions reductions in the spirit of real-world change:\n\n## Swiss Re Asset Management's climate targets by 2025\n\n## Financing transition:\n\n## Engagement:\n\n- \u00b7  Green, social and sustainability bonds: USD 4bn\n- \u00b7  Renewable and social infrastructure loans: + USD 750m\n\n## Sub-portfolio:\n\n## Sector:\n\n- \u00b7  Listed equity and corporate bond portfolio: -35% carbon intensity\n- \u00b7  Swiss and German real estate portfolio: -5% carbon intensity\n- \u00b7  Listed equity and corporate bond portfolio: coal phase-out by 2030\n- \u00b7  Infrastructure loans and private placements: maturity limitation for fossil fuel-related investments\n\n- \u00b7  Topic: alignment with 1.5\u00b0C target\n\n## Enable the transition to a net-zero emissions economy and mitigate climate-related risks",

        "page_content": "## Climate risk management\n\nThe processes used to identify, assess and manage climate-related risks are integrated into Swiss Re's risk management, underwriting and asset management.\n\nSound risk management, underwriting and asset management lie at the core of Swiss Re's businesses. This enables Swiss Re to use existing processes and instruments to address climate-related risks.\n\n## Re/insurance activities and own operations\n\n## Physical risks\n\n## Property re/insurance\n\nBesides man-made risks, natural catastrophe risks are the key risk category in Swiss Re's P&C re/insurance risk landscape.\n\nSwiss Re has an internal property risk modelling team that builds, maintains and updates sophisticated models for all relevant natural catastrophe risks such as tropical cyclones, floods, winter storms and earthquakes. The models are based on current scientific knowledge and are updated regularly or on an ad-hoc basis within a few months, if required. The updates make use of new scientific findings - including from research collaborations with academic institutions - and advances in computing and modelling capabilities.\n\nSwiss Re's proprietary and fully integrated property natural catastrophe risk models are important tools for managing the business: they are used to determine the economic capital required to support the risks on Swiss Re's books as well as to allocate risk-taking capacity to different lines of business.\n\nSecondary perils, which are smaller natural catastrophe scenarios such as flood, smaller storms, or wildfire, have generated an increasing amount of property losses in recent years. The trend is expected to continue, fostered by a warming climate, urbanisation and asset growth in exposed areas. 2021 has made its imprint with winter storm Uri, and the summer flood and hail events in Europe. Looking back at the last few years, wildfire losses have become a noticeable segment in both the industry and Swiss Re's own loss experience. Swiss Re executes on a broad secondary perils agenda across three pillars, focusing on:\n\n- 1.  Firming and expanding risk views, reflective of macro risk trends (climate change, urbanisation, etc)\n- 2.  Inter-peril correlation (research and embed global peril correlations into underwriting risk decisions and risk management)\n- 3.  Governance and steering: enhance capturing of secondary perils in pricings to enable rigid monitoring, steering and establishing an enhanced framework for actual vs expected analysis\n\n## Life and health re/insurance\n\nClimate change is one of many risk drivers for Swiss Re's life and health businesses. Mortality assumptions (base rates and trend) underlying the re/insurance business are formally reviewed at different intervals. Base mortality rates are updated at least once per year for major markets and less frequently for smaller markets based mostly on recent experience data from Swiss Re's portfolio. The trend assumptions for the first 20 years are reviewed annually. For the long-term, they are reviewed on a bi-annual basis. The long-term trend assumption is where climate change (ie heatwaves, air pollution from wildfires and vector-borne diseases) is likely to make a material impact, if at all. Swiss Re Institute Life & Health Research & Development is leading this process in conjunction with the Business Units. In addition to external and internal data and analysis, the latest available scientific evidence regarding the impact of climate change on health outcomes is also considered. The results of this process are reviewed and signed off by the Group Executive Committee.\n\n## Own operations\n\nFor Swiss Re's own operations, robust and regularly tested business continuity plans covering all locations are in place to mitigate the risk of climate-related disruptions. Strategies include transferring work and/or employees to unaffected Swiss Re locations and providing temporary alternative office space. The Own The Way You Work TM Programme, which was introduced in 2013 and offers employees full flexibility in their work arrangements through the use of laptops and seamless access to a Swiss Re Virtual Workplace, is also a viable and effective alternative. The programme enabled a smooth transition to a remote working environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the majority of employees worked from home for many months.",

Technological developments are monitored through Swiss Re's respective underwriting units and pricing of associated covers is reviewed on an annual basis.\n\n## General sustainability risks in Swiss Re's re/insurance business\n\nSwiss Re's ESG Risk Framework is an advanced risk management instrument that identifies, assesses and addresses social and environmental risks associated with Swiss Re's transactions, both on the underwriting and investment side. Two policies of the ESG Risk Framework are particularly relevant in the context of climate change: the Thermal Coal Policy and the Oil and Gas Policy.\n\n## Thermal Coal Policy\n\nIn the Thermal Coal Policy, established in 2018, Swiss Re pledges not to provide re/insurance to businesses with more than 30% exposure to thermal coal utilities or mining. The policy applies to both old and new thermal coal projects and across all lines of business. While it is relatively easy to implement this policy in some parts of the business, for others the transition will take some time and will require a continued and constructive dialogue with clients. Swiss Re continues to implement the\n\nThermal Coal Policy for treaty business. The approach defines thresholds for coal exposures in treaties across property, engineering, casualty, credit and surety, and marine cargo lines of business. These thresholds for reinsurance treaty business will come into effect in 2023 and will then be gradually lowered until the final phaseout targets for OECD countries by 2030 and non-OECD countries for 2040 are reached.\n\n## Enhanced Oil and Gas Policy\n\nIn 2021, Swiss Re stopped providing individual insurance covers for those oil and gas companies that are responsible for the world's 5% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production. From July 2023, Swiss Re will no longer provide individual insurance covers for those oil and gas companies that are responsible for the world's 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas production.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo learn more about the Swiss Re ESG Risk Framework, carbon risk steering mechanism and thermal coal and oil and gas policies, please visit the Swiss Re website.\n\nSwiss Re recently further strengthened the Oil and Gas Policy, based on Swiss Re's net-zero commitments and in response to new scientific findings published by the International Energy Agency. Swiss Re will no longer re/insure or directly invest in new oil and gas field projects that receive their go-ahead (in the form of a final investment decision) from their parent companies after 2022. Exceptions will apply to projects of companies aligned with net-zero emissions by 2050, as defined by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTi) or a comparable third-party assessment.\n\nAs most of the global expansion of oil and gas exploration and production is insured via company-wide property insurance policies, Swiss Re has taken measures to align these portfolios (in both direct insurance and facultative reinsurance) with its commitment to net-zero emissions by 2050.\n\nSwiss Re will partner with oil and gas clients (up-, mid- and downstream) on the transition to net-zero emissions and will align re/insurance support to companies according to the below ambitions. These ambitions will be translated into net-zero alignment targets once guidance based on science-based target setting becomes available.\n\n- \u00b7 By 2025, half of Swiss Re's oil and gas premiums are to come from companies that are aligned with net-zero by 2050, as per SBTi or a comparable, credible third-party assessment.\n- \u00b7 By 2030, Swiss Re's oil and gas re/insurance portfolios are to contain only companies that are aligned with net-zero by 2050, also as per SBTi or a comparable, credible third-party assessment.\n\nFurthermore, from July 2022 Swiss Re will no longer re/insure or invest in companies and projects with more than 10% of their production located in the Arctic AMAP region (Norwegian production is exempt).\n\nSwiss Re is also developing an approach for oil and gas in treaty reinsurance, to be finalised by 2023.",

In 2021, specific NGFS climate scenarios were linked to Swiss Re's investment portfolio to derive the portfolio's sensitivity to these different scenarios.\n\nThe following NGFS scenarios were selected for the analysis:\n\n- \u00b7 Orderly: climate policies are introduced early and become gradually more stringent. Net-zero CO2 emissions achieved before 2070, giving a 67% chance of limiting global warming to below 2\u00b0C. Physical and transition risks are both relatively low.\n- \u00b7 Disorderly: climate policies are only introduced in 2030. Emissions reductions need to be sharper than in the orderly scenario to limit warming to the same target. The result is higher transition risk.\n- \u00b7 Hot house world: Only currently implemented policies are preserved. Emissions grow until 2080 leading to 3\u00b0C+ of warming and severe physical risks.\n\nSwiss Re's emissions reduction target was based on the IPCC 1.5\u00b0C pathway scenario, which puts Asset Management on a decarbonisation pathway consistent with an orderly scenario in the short- to mid-term per end of 2021. However, further reductions in carbon intensity will be needed to remain consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C trajectory post 2030/2035. The main part of the ongoing scenario analysis builds on the expertise Swiss Re has already gained. It aims to increase its understanding regarding the three selected NGFS scenarios and their impact on the portfolio, with a focus on a disorderly transition. In the early stages, corporate bonds and listed equity are in focus, striving to build a solid framework that allows Swiss Re to compile meaningful and robust results that can serve both as a tool to improve investment processes and to inform the current status and progress of its climate actions.\n\n## Emissions\n\nRepresentative scenarios\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: NGFS\n\n## Transition risk analytics\n\nThe market environment has started to shift to address climate change mitigation and adaptation requirements to limit the global temperature rise. Governments and regulators have accelerated the development of (mandatory) reporting requirements and risk assessments to steer and transition climate change-related market activities towards more sustainable alternatives. Swiss Re continues to consider policy and legal risks, as well as technology risks, having mainly seen changes within these two dimensions that potentially impact asset values.\n\nOne example is the outcome of COP26 on the phase-down of unabated coal-fired power generation and the phase-out of inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. Swiss Re has already taken action in recent years by introducing thresholds for coal-related investments and moving away from the 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas companies with the aspiration to proactively manage the now increasing risk of stranded assets.\n\nSwiss Re's dedicated approach to managing climate risk involves the systematic monitoring of the carbon intensity of its government bond, corporate bond, listed equity and real estate portfolio. For the corporate bond and listed equity portfolio, related forward-looking indicators are also tracked. For example, in 2021, Swiss Re further strengthened its approach to assessing the alignment of the corporate bond and listed equity portfolio with a 1.5\u00b0C target by evaluating the temperature alignment.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risk in corporate bonds and listed equity\n\nCarbon intensity (WACI, sales-based taking Scope 1 and 2 emissions into account) is seen as a useful measure to quantify the carbon consumption for multi-asset portfolios and remains a measure of choice for comparisons over time, between portfolios and against benchmarks. Swiss Re therefore sets its carbon reduction targets based on this metric.\n\nTemperature alignment methods, on the other hand, have the clear benefit of providing a forward-looking element and thus a high degree of signalling. However, comparability across methodologies/ providers is limited at this point, as the temperature alignment methods are still evolving. No global standard for calculating the implied temperature scores has yet been established, and timeliness and stability of data continue to be a key challenge. Swiss Re will continue to use the temperature alignment outputs to identify portfolio leaders and laggards.\n\n## Transition risk in real estate\n\nA carbon intensity-based measure is also applied in real estate. The carbon profile of the real estate portfolio is measured against decarbonisation pathways for both 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C scenarios, provided by the 'Carbon Risk Real Estate Monitor' (CRREM) tool. The CRREM pathways are in line with the Paris Agreement and are based on the breakdown of the global GHG budget into individual country- and property-type specific carbon budgets.\n\nSwiss Re analysis shows that the combined Swiss and German portfolio emission intensity is already at a very low energy consumption level, which is considered consistent with a 1.5\u00b0C trajectory per end of 2021 (excluding the effects of embodied carbon emissions). Further reductions in carbon intensity will be needed, however, to remain consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C trajectory post-2030/2035.\n\n## Physical risks analytics\n\nThe physical risk analysis focuses on real assets with clearly identifiable locations mostly within Swiss Re's private debt (including infrastructure loans and commercial mortgage lending), commercial mortgage-backed securities and real estate holdings. Focus was placed on acute, event-driven impacts due to natural perils, eg tropical cyclones and floods, resulting in direct damage to assets. Based on Swiss Re's proprietary modelling capabilities used for re/insurance underwriting (see page 156), results were derived and simple stresses were calculated to gain an understanding of what an increase in severity and frequency of climate-related perils could mean. Furthermore, exposure changes under the different warming scenarios were modelled and assessed. The results of both analyses suggest a very low exposure of Swiss Re's real asset holdings to natural perils in general and to climate-related perils in particular.",

In previous years, gross premiums were reported.\n\n## Annual expected losses (AEL)\n\nAEL for weather-related natural perils can be used as an indicator for the average current climate-related risk exposure. However, AEL figures do not, by definition, provide an adequate measure for the potential risk of individual years with exceptionally intense natural catastrophe losses. Adequate metrics for the risk of individual rare natural catastrophes are Value at Risk (VaR) or Tail Value at Risk (Tail VaR). For example, the 99.5% VaR measures the loss likely to be exceeded in only one year out of two hundred, see Financial Report page 71, where the results of insurance risk stress tests are provided for peak insurance risks.\n\nThe AEL figures are the result of expected weather activities, the vulnerability of insured assets and operations, their values and the volume and structure of insurance products. Changes in the AEL figures will show the evolution of Swiss Re's climate risk exposure. This could be due to climate change, but also due to changes in the vulnerability of insured assets and operations, their values or changes in the Group's business strategy. AEL figures are updated on an annual basis.\n\nThe table on the right shows the AEL by region and peril as well as the highest gross AEL for Swiss Re's business as of the end of 2021.\n\n## Gross AEL for weather-related perils by region and for peak exposures, Swiss Re Group (2019-2021, USD million)\n\n|                           | 2019   | 2020   | 2021    |\n|---------------------------|--------|--------|---------|\n| Total                     | 1 915  | 2 170  | 2 010   |\n| North America             | 890    | 1 005  | 1 000   |\n| Latin America             | 175    | 220    | 185     |\n| EMEA                      | 305    | 355    | 295     |\n| Asia                      | 310    | 415    | 360     |\n| Oceania                   | 225    | 175    | 175     |\n| Tropical cyclone          | 980    | 1 150  | 1 0 5 5 |\n| North America             | 550    | 615    | 580     |\n| Latin America             | 145    | 180    | 160     |\n| EMEA                      | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| Asia                      | 235    | 310    | 280     |\n| Oceania                   | 50     | 45     | 35      |\n| Convective storms         | 300    | 330    | 360     |\n| North America             | 220    | 240    | 255     |\n| Latin America             | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| EMEA                      | 45     | 45     | 40      |\n| Asia                      | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| Oceania                   | 35     | 45     | 65      |\n| Flood                     | 285    | 340    | 320     |\n| North America             | 65     | 80     | 85      |\n| Latin America             | 25     | 30     | 25      |\n| EMEA                      | 95     | 110    | 105     |\n| Asia                      | 60     | 85     | 75      |\n| Oceania                   | 40     | 35     | 30      |\n| Windstorm                 | 190    | 230    | 190     |\n| North America             | 45     | 50     | 50      |\n| Latin America             | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| EMEA                      | 145    | 180    | 140     |\n| Asia                      | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| Oceania                   | 0      | 0      | 0       |\n| All other perils          | 150    | 120    | 90      |\n| North America             | 10     | 20     | 30      |\n| Latin America             | 5      | 10     |         |\n| EMEA                      | 20     | 20     | 0 10    |\n| Asia                      | 15     | 20     | 5       |\n| Oceania                   | 100    | 50     | 45      |\n| Peak exposures            |        |        |         |\n| North Atlantic hurricane  | 680    | 770    | 720     |\n| US tornado                | 220    | 240    | 260     |\n| Japanese tropical cyclone | 140    | 210    | 180     |\n| European windstorm        | 150    | 180    | 140     |\n| European flood            | 90     | 100    | 100     |\n\nRegional figures may not add up to the world total due to rounding.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nYou can download all the data from the TCFD and the Sustainability Report from the Swiss Re website.",

        "page_content": "## Transition risk\n\n## Several steps to align the underwriting portfolio with the Paris Agreement\n\nSwiss Re sought to further refine the assessment of the carbon footprint of its direct insurance business based on the methodology proposed by the CRO Forum. The effort again brought to light that there are significant limitations to data availability at present and that carbon footprint estimates for re/insurance underwriting are thus marked by considerable uncertainty.\n\nKeeping these uncertainties in mind, Swiss Re estimates the weighted average carbon intensity of its direct insurance portfolio for 2021 remained unchanged at 120 tonnes of CO2e per million US dollars of revenue. The fluctuations that were observed in the results are not statistically significant.\n\nThe thermal coal and oil and gas policies within Swiss Re's ESG Risk Framework (see Climate risk management, page 176) are important steps on the path to reaching net-zero emissions for the re/insurance portfolio by 2050. The Coal Policy puts Swiss Re on course to reach the Group-wide target of completely phasing out thermal coal business in OECD countries by 2030, and in the rest of the world by 2040. The policies are also in line with the commitment made in 2019 by becoming a member of the Powering Past Coal Alliance.\n\nThese policies are an initial step towards the development of a comprehensive carbon risk steering mechanism. Such a mechanism is needed to measure Swiss Re's GHG emissions and associated risks related to its re/insurance business. Swiss Re co-founded the UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA). The NZIA is collaborating with the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) with the goal to establish a standard to measure and disclose emissions associated with re/insurance underwriting portfolios.\n\nSwiss Re chairs the NZIA working group tasked to develop the insurance-associated emissions standard, which will help bring the insurance sector and the real economy one step closer to a net-zero future. Measuring Swiss Re's carbon footprint in line with the foreseen PCAF standard will provide the basis for its carbon steering towards reaching net-zero emissions on the liability side of the business by 2050.\n\n## Swiss Re as a founding member of the NZIA\n\nThe UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance (NZIA) brings together twenty-one of the world's leading insurers and reinsurers to play their part in accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions economies. They have committed to individually transition their underwriting portfolios to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100. Swiss Re is among the founding members of the NZIA, together with AXA (Chair), Allianz, Aviva, Generali, Munich Re, SCOR, Swiss Re, and Zurich.\n\nAs risk managers, insurers and investors, the insurance industry plays a key role in supporting the transition to a net-zero economy. The NZIA is building on the pioneering work that the founding signatories have already begun as investors through their membership of the Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance, where all eight NZIA founding members are already individually setting sciencebased 2025 decarbonisation targets for their respective investment portfolios in line with a net-zero transition pathway.\n\nSwiss Re's engagement with the NZIA also builds on its efforts to phase out thermal coal exposure by 2030 for OECD countries and the rest of the world by 2040. In addition, Swiss Re gradually started withdrawing insurance support from the most carbon-intensive oil and gas production in 2021.\n\n## Find out more on the NZIA:\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nLaunch of UN-convened Net-Zero Insurance Alliance - Swiss Re as a founding member | Swiss Re\n\nNet-Zero Insurance Alliance United Nations Environment Finance Initiative\n\n## Climate-related commitments to the United Nations and the Insurance Development Forum\n\nIn 2019, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), the government of Germany and members of the Insurance Development Forum entered into a Tripartite Agreement in which they collectively committed to increasing insurance protection in climatevulnerable countries. As part of their commitment, industry members pledged to offer USD 5 billion of risk capacity for climate risk insurance, benefitting up to 500 million people in twenty climatevulnerable countries by 2025. The commitment aims to accelerate the implementation of risk management and risk financing solutions as a means to strengthen adaptation measures and the resilience to climate risks in exposed countries. As a member of the IDF, Swiss Re has endorsed this commitment along with several of its industry peers.\n\nTo achieve this commitment, Germany's KfW Development Bank has provided funding via the InsuResilience Solutions Fund (ISF) and project teams for sixteen of the climate-vulnerable countries have been established. Swiss Re currently co-leads six of these country project teams (Ghana, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Colombia) and contributes to an additional five country project teams by providing risk and modelling insights. To meet the commitments of the Tripartite Agreement, Swiss Re and members of the IDF will continue to collaborate with climate-vulnerable countries by providing risk modelling expertise and working to expand the project pipeline in the respective countries see Swiss Re Sustainability Report, page 29 for more details.",

        "page_content": "## Investment activities\n\nThrough its dedicated climate action, Swiss Re is working to achieve a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050 by setting intermediate targets every five years and regularly reporting on progress. Targets were set in 2020 for 2025 in accordance with the AOA's inaugural 2025 Target setting Protocol (TSP).\n\n## Financing transition targets\n\nGreen bond proceeds are used to finance environmentally sustainable projects and thereby facilitate the transition towards a net-zero emissions economy. By the end of 2021, Swiss Re held USD 3 billion in green bonds. As part of Swiss Re's adaptation strategy, its mandate also considers social and sustainability bonds. This enables the company to not only support the environment, but also underserved groups or populations, thus generating a positive impact on society.\n\nThe ambition is to achieve an investment target of USD 4 billion for green, social and sustainability bonds by the end of 2024. As part of Swiss Re's climate-positive investments, it has also set a target to increase its renewable energy and social infrastructure loan portfolio, which also includes energy efficiency, by USD 750 million by the end of 2024.\n\nInfrastructure loans are an attractive asset class for Swiss Re's investment portfolio given the spread premium and diversification benefits relative to corporate bonds. Renewable infrastructure loans in particular are used to finance environmentally sustainable infrastructure projects. Social infrastructure loans are used to finance projects such as hospitals, student dorms or affordable housing. By the end of 2021, Swiss Re held USD 1.0 billion in renewable energy and social infrastructure loans, which is an increase of 100 million relative to 2020.\n\n## Engagement targets\n\nSwiss Re believes that engagement with the real economy is an integral component to support the limitation of global warming to 1.5\u00b0C. In 2020, it therefore established an Engagement Framework aligned with the sub-portfolio targets. For additional information on Swiss Re's engagement targets and activities, see Sustainability Report 2021, pages 46-49.\n\n## Sub-portfolio targets\n\nSwiss Re committed to have a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Informed by IPCC's pathways consistent with the 1.5\u00b0C target, Swiss Re established a corporate bond and listed equity portfolio emissions reduction target of -35% for Scope 1 and 2 emissions to be achieved by 2025 and with 2018 as the base year (see below, 'Deep dive: Carbon footprint of the corporate bond and listed equity portfolio').\n\nFurthermore, Swiss Re set a carbon intensity reduction target for its Swiss and German real estate investment portfolio of -5% with 2018 as the base year, to be achieved by year-end 2024. This builds on the portfolio emissions intensity analysis described in the section 'Transition risk in real estate'. The chart below depicts the outcome of the analysis for the Swiss real estate portfolio and confirms the status of being well below a 1.5\u00b0 decarbonisation pathway, though further improvements in energy efficiency will be needed post2030. Similar analysis conducted on the German part of the portfolio resulted in a comparable outcome.\n\nThe analysis focuses on the combined Swiss and German portfolio's carbon intensity versus the year-end 2024 target and shows that the targeted reductions are likely to be achievable.\n\n## Sector targets\n\nCoal assets are particularly carbon intensive and susceptible to becoming stranded given the long life of these assets, as well as the evolving regulations on carbon emissions. Swiss Re does not invest in thermal coal-related activities that exceed the set thresholds. The long-term objective for 2030 is to fully exit coal-related assets, such as coal mining and coal-based power generation, for the listed equity and corporate bond portfolio via normal portfolio reallocations.\n\nAdditionally, and in line with the Groupwide ESG Risk Framework, Swiss Re divested from the world's 10% most carbon-intensive oil and gas companies in 2020.\n\nFor infrastructure loan and corporate private placement portfolios, Swiss Re excludes any coal-related assets. For both asset classes, maturities are limited to 2030 for oil-related exposures and to 2035 for gas-related exposures. These guidelines support an investment universe that is in line with the commitment to a net-zero emissions investment portfolio by 2050. Swiss Re's specific approach to these sectors is outlined in the section 'Climate strategy'.\n\n## Swiss real estate portfolio carbon intensity vs 1.5\u00b0C decarbonisation pathway (kgCO2e/m2/annum)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSource: Swiss Re, CRREM",

This metric has the clear benefit of providing a forward-looking element and thus a high degree of signalling.\n\nWhile results and analytics allow for a granular assessment of the carbon risks embedded in Swiss Re's holdings and will help to not only gain a deep understanding of our portfolio positioning, several caveats need to be made: comparability across methodologies/providers is limited at this point in the absence of a recognised global standard and given these methods are still evolving.

To achieve this goal, Swiss Re has adopted a 'do our best, remove the rest' approach under its CO2NetZero Programme.\n\n'Doing our best' means intensifying efforts to reduce emissions. A special focus lies on business travel emissions, which are currently responsible for the bulk of the Group's reported operational carbon footprint. The reduction target for CO2 emissions from air travel has been tightened to at least 50% for 2022 (relative to the 2018 level) to prevent going back to the pre-pandemic flight levels.\n\nThe CO2 targets are supported by a Carbon Steering Levy introduced in 2021 (see box). While Swiss Re is already using 100% of its power from renewable sources, the amount of energy consumed per full time employee (FTE) is also targeted to decline by 2% per year throughout the decade (baseline 2018).\n\nWith '\u2026 remove the rest' Swiss Re will gradually move from conventional carbon offsetting to supporting high-quality, ie durable and scalable carbon removal projects. This gradual transition means that Swiss Re will be able to uphold the climate neutrality claim of its former Greenhouse Neutral Programme (see box on page 188), while preparing to balance all remaining emissions through carbon removal by 2030 under the current CO2NetZero Programme (see Sustainability Report, pages 60-61 for more details on the CO2NetZero Programme).\n\n## Swiss Re's Carbon Steering Levy\n\nIn September 2020, Swiss Re was the first multinational company to announce a triple-digit real internal carbon price on both direct and indirect operational greenhouse gas emissions, ie on all Scope 1, all Scope 2 and a significant part of the upstream Scope 3 emissions (business travel, energy transmission and distribution, paper, water, waste) across all business units and countries of operations.\n\nThis Carbon Steering Levy will gradually increase from USD 100 per tonne of CO2 in 2021 to USD 200 in 2030. The latter corresponds to the market price that Swiss Re experts expect for high-quality removals in 2030, based on cost projections in scientific literature and current market intelligence.\n\nThe levy is the overarching element of the CO2NetZero Programme, as it helps Swiss Re to meet both the 'Do our best, \u2026' and '\u2026 remove the rest' objectives simultaneously.\n\nSwiss Re expects that placing a stringent price on carbon and increasing it on an annual basis will help it to achieve further emission cuts by incentivising concrete reduction measures and low-carbon behaviour. To this end, the levy is displayed at all decision-making levels, for instance, in the travel booking tool where different flight options are compared.\n\nAt the same time, the levy will secure the funds required to compensate the remaining emissions in line with our net-zero by 2030 target.",

        "page_content": "Carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere through nature-based solutions like afforestation, which also have substantial co-benefits such as improved biodiversity. However, nature-based solutions are limited by other important types of land-use and are vulnerable to the risk of stored carbon escaping ('storage reversal'). Therefore, technological carbon removal solutions such as direct air capture are needed to keep global warming well below 2\u00b0C over the long term. They are more durable and scalable than naturebased solutions, but are currently much more expensive, mainly due to their large energy requirements and early stage of development. To help to bring down the cost of technical carbon removal solutions Swiss Re started a partnership with Climeworks, a leading specialist in direct air capture and storage of CO2 in 2021 (see Sustainability Report 2021, page 64).\n\n## Milestones under Swiss Re's Greenhouse Neutral Programme\n\nBetween 2003 and 2020 Swiss Re ran its Greenhouse Neutral Programme, combining major commitments to cut CO2 emissions, reduce energy intensity, use renewable power and compensate the remaining emissions. These are some of the milestones of the programme:\n\n- \u00b7 Per-capita CO2 emissions reduced by more than half between 2003 and 2019 (Scope 1, Scope 2 and parts of upstream Scope 3)\n- \u00b7 All remaining CO2 emissions compensated since 2003 (Scope 1, Scope 2 and parts of upstream Scope 3, in particular business travel)\n- \u00b7 Only renewable power used by 2020\n- \u00b7 More than 33 000 subsidies granted to employees for emissions-cutting investments between 2007 and 2020\n\n## Greenhouse gas emissions data disclosure\n\nEver since Swiss Re first launched its Greenhouse Neutral Programme in 2003, the Group has disclosed its operational environmental performance indicators. The disclosure includes greenhouse gas emissions and their relative performance over time, with an expanded reporting scope starting from 2013.\n\nIn 2021, at the start of the ten-year reporting cycle of the CO2NetZero Programme (2021-2030), Swiss Re undertook a full re-baselining exercise to update the greenhouse gas emission factors and improve the calculation methodology, aligning it with the latest climate science and relevant frameworks. The methodology used to calculate emissions is based on the guidelines of the GHG Protocol - Corporate Standard, the most widely used emissions accounting and reporting standard.\n\nThe baseline year for the current reporting cycle is set to 2018. The full disclosure of the Group's operational emissions is presented in the tables on the following pages.\n\nSwiss Re strives to continuously improve the calculation methodology for the emissions in its current reporting boundary. However, a large portion of upstream Scope 3 operational emissions remains unmeasured and therefore is currently not reported. These emissions, mostly stemming from the activities in Swiss Re's supply chain, are roughly estimated as being five to ten times higher than Swiss Re's total reported emissions. This difference has increased significantly in the past two years due to the sharp reduction of emissions from business travel, as a result of COVID-19 pandemic. 1\n\nThe unreported emissions are difficult to quantify accurately because their sources are beyond Swiss Re's direct operational control, and methods and tools to collect the underlying activity data are not yet readily available. In line with Swiss Re's ambition to reduce its operational footprint and achieve the target of net-zero emissions in operations by 2030, the next challenge will be to work in close collaboration with the main suppliers to identify, quantify and develop synergies to address the most material emission hot spots in the supply chain.",

        "page_content": "## Notes to the Group financial statements\n\n## 1 Organisation and summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Nature of operations\n\nThe Swiss Re Group, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, comprises Swiss Re Ltd (the parent company) and its subsid iaries (collectively, the 'Swiss Re Group' or the 'Group'). The Swiss Re Group is a wholesale provider of reinsurance, insurance and other insurance-based forms of risk transfer as well as other insurance-related services. Working through brokers and a network of offices around the globe, the Group serves a client base consisting of insurance companies, mid - to large-sized corporations and public-sector clients.\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (US GAAP) and comply with Swiss law. All si gnificant intra-group transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.\n\nOn 22 July 2020, the Group completed the sale of ReAssure to Phoenix. Subsequently, the subject business was deconsolidated a s of that date. Further details on the transaction are provided in Note 10 'Disposals'.\n\nThe segmental disclosures have been revised to reflect the way the Group manages its business activities: as of 1 January 202 1, the Life Capital reporting segment ceased to be a separate Business Unit; iptiQ is a  division and is reported as part of the Group items; and elipsLife is part of the Corporate Solutions reporting segment. Segmental comparative information for 2020 has been adjusted accordingl y. The Life Capital reporting segment for the comparative period 2020 reflects the ReAssure business. There is no impact on the Group net income and the Group net assets. Further details are provided in Note 2 'Information on business segments'.\n\nThe Board of Directors of Swiss Re Ltd has decided that as of 1 January 2 024 the Group's consolidated financial statements will be prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). Financial statements for periods ending on or prior to  31 December 2023 will continue to be prepared in accordance with US GAAP. The adoption is expected to have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe Group's financial statements include the consolidated financial statements of Swiss Re Ltd and its subsidiaries. Voting e ntities which Swiss Re Ltd directly or indirectly controls through holding a majority of the voting rights are consolidated in the Group's accounts. Variable interest entities (VIEs) are consolidated when the Swiss Re Group is the primary beneficiary. The Grou p is the primary beneficiary when it has power over the activities that impact the VIE's economic performance and at the same time has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Companies which the Group does not control, but over which it directly or indirectly exercises significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method or the fair value option and are includ ed in other invested assets. The Swiss Re Group's share of net profit or loss in investments accounted for under the equity method is included in net investment income. Equity and net income of these companies are adjusted as necessary to be in line with the Group's accounting policies . The results of consolidated subsidiaries and investments accounted for using the equity method are included in the financial statements for the period commencing from the date of acquisition.\n\n## Use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the related disclosure, including contingent assets and liab ilities. The Swiss Re Group's liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses and policy benefits  for life and health include estimates for premium, claim and benefit data not received from ceding companies at the date of the financial statements. In addition, the Group use s certain financial instruments and invests in securities of certain entities for which exchange trading does not exist. The Group determines these estimates based on historical information, actuarial analyses, financial modelling and other analytical techniques. Actual re sults could differ significantly from the estimates described above.",

        "page_content": "## Foreign currency remeasurement and translation\n\nTransactions denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured to the respective subsidiary's functional currency at average exchange rates. Monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at closing exchange rates, whereas non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured to the functional currency at historical rates. Remeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities and trading securities are reported in earnings. Remeasurement gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, investments in consolidated subsidiaries and investments accounted for using the equity method are reported in shareholders' equity.\n\nFor consolidation purposes, assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars are translated from the functional currency to US dollars at closing rates. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates. Translati on adjustments are reported in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Valuation of financial assets\n\nThe fair value of the majority of the Group's financial instruments is based on quoted prices in active markets or observable  inputs. These instruments include government and agency securities, commercial paper, most investment-grade corporate debt, most high-yield debt securities, exchange-traded derivative instruments, most mortgage- and asset-backed securities and listed equity securities. In markets with reduced or no liquidity, spreads between bid and offer prices are normally wider compared to spreads in highly liquid markets. Such market conditions affect the valuation of certain asset classes of the Group, such as some asset -backed securities as well as certain derivative structures referencing such asset classes.\n\nThe Group considers both the credit risk of its counterparties and own risk of non -performance in the valuation of derivative instruments and other over-the-counter financial assets. In determining the fair value of these financial instruments, the as sessment of the Group's exposure to the credit risk of its counterparties incorporates consideration of existing collateral and netting arrangements entered i nto with each counterparty. The measure of the counterparty credit risk is estimated by incorporating the observable credit spreads, where available, or credit spread estimates derived based on the benchmarking techniques where market data is not available. The impact of the Gr oup's own risk of non-performance is analysed in a manner consistent with the aforementioned approach, with consideration given to the Group's observable credit spreads. The value representing such risk is incorporated into the fair value of the financial instruments (primarily derivatives), in a liability position as of the measurement date. The change in this adjustment from period to period is reflected in realised investment gains and losses in the income statement.\n\nFor assets or derivative structures at fair value, the Group uses market prices or inputs derived from market prices. A separate internal price verification process, independent of the trading function, provides an additional control over the market prices or market in puts used to determine the fair values of such assets. Although management considers that appropriate values have been ascribed to such assets, there is always a level of uncertainty and judgement related to these valuations. Subsequent valuations could differ significantly fro m the results of the process described above. The Group may become aware of counterparty valuations, either directly through the exchange of information or indirectly, for example through collateral demands. Any implied differences are considered in the independent price verifi cation process and may result in adjustments to initially indicated valuations. As of 31 December 2021, the Group had not provided any collateral on financial instruments in excess of its own market value estimates.\n\n## Investments\n\nThe Group's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale (AFS) or trading. Fixed income securities AFS are carried at fair value, based on quoted market prices, with the difference between the applicable measure of cost and fair val ue being recognised in shareholders' equity. Trading fixed income securities are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings. A trading classification is used for securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling the m in the near term.\n\nFor fixed income securities AFS that are other-than-temporary impaired and for which there is not an intention to sell, the impairment is separated into (i) the estimated amount relating to credit loss, and (ii) the amount relating to all other factors, including interest rates and associated foreign currency impacts. The estimated credit loss amount is recognised in earnings, with the remainder of the loss amount recognised in other comprehensive income. In cases where there is an intention or requirement to sell and the fair value i s lower than cost expressed in functional currency terms, the cost of fixed income securities AFS is reduced to fair value, with a correspondin g charge to realised investment losses. Subsequent recoveries are not recognised in earnings.\n\nEquity investments are carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses recognised in earnings, with the exception of equity method investments and investments that result in consolidation.\n\nInterest on fixed income securities is recorded in net investment income when earned and is adjusted for the amortisation of any purchase premium or discount. Dividends on equity securities are recognised as investment income on the ex -dividend date. Realised gains and losses on sales are included in earnings and are calculated using the specific identification method.\n\nPolicy loans, mortgages and other loans are carried at amortised cost. Interest income is recognised in accordance with the e ffective yield method.\n\nInvestment in real estate that the Group intends to hold for the production of income is carried at depreciated cost, net of any write -downs for impairment in value. Depreciation on buildings is recognised on a straight -line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset. Land is recognised at cost and not depreciated. Impairment in value is recognised if the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\nthe use of the real estate is lower than its carrying value. The impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset 's carrying amount exceeds its fair value and is recognised in realised investment losses. Depreciation and other related charges or credits are included in net investment income. Investment in real estate held for sale is carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimat ed selling costs, and is not depreciated. Reductions in the carrying value of real estate held for sale are included in realised investment losses.\n\nShort-term investments are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in net income. The Group considers highly liquid investments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of one year or less, but greater than three months, to be sh ort-term investments.\n\nOther invested assets include affiliated companies, equity accounted companies, derivative financial instruments, collateral receivables, securities purchased under agreement to resell, deposits and time deposits, and investments without readily determi nable fair value (including limited partnership investments). Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest equals or exceeds 3% are accounted for using the equity method. Investments in limited partnerships where the Group's interest is b elow 3% and equity investments in corporate entities which are not publicly traded are accounted for at estimated fair value with changes in fair value reco gnised in earnings.\n\nThe Group enters into securities lending arrangements under which it loans certain securities in exchange for collateral and receives securities lending fees. The Group's policy is to require collateral, consisting of cash or securities, equal to at least 102 % of the carrying value of the securities loaned. In certain arrangements, the Group may accept collateral of less than 102% if the structure of the overall transaction offers an equivalent level of security. Cash received as collateral is recognised along with an obligation to return the cash . Securities received as collateral that can be sold or repledged are also recognised along with an obligation to return those securities. Securities lending fees  are recognised over the term of the related loans.\n\n## Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting\n\nThe Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments including swaps, options, forwards and exchange-traded financial futures for the Group's trading and hedging strategy in line with the overall risk management strategy. Derivative financial instruments are primarily used as a means of managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purcha ses, existing assets or existing liabilities and also to lock in attractive investment conditions for funds which become availab le in the future. The Group recognises all of its derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in fair value on derivatives that ar e not designated as hedging instruments are recorded in income.\n\nIf the derivative is designated as a hedge of the fair value of assets or liabilities, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised in earnings, together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If the derivative is designated as a hedge of the variability in expected future cash flows related to a particular risk, changes in the fair value of the derivative are reported in other compr ehensive income until the hedged item is recognised in earnings. The ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised in earnings. Wh en hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge, the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified  to earnings in the period in which the formerly hedged transaction is reported in earnings. When the Group discontinues hedge accounting because it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur within the required time period, the derivative continues to be c arried on the balance sheet at fair value, and gains and losses that were previously re corded in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognised in earnings.\n\nThe Group recognises separately derivatives that are embedded within other host instruments if the economic characteristics and risks are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and if it meets the definition of a derivative if it were a free-standing contract.\n\nDerivative financial instrument assets are generally included in other invested assets and derivative financial instrument liabilities are generally included in accrued expenses and other liabilities.\n\nThe Group also designates non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in certain foreign operations. From the inception of the hedging relationship, remeasurement gains and losses on the designated non-derivative and derivative monetary financial instruments and translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment are reported as translation gains and losses in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, short-term deposits, certain short-term investments in money market funds and highly liquid debt instruments with a remaining maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less.\n\n## Deferred acquisition costs\n\nThe Group incurs costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal reinsurance and insurance business. Some of these costs, which consist primarily of commissions, are deferred as they are directly related to the successful acquisition of such business.\n\nDeferred acquisition costs for short-duration contracts are amortised in proportion to premiums earned. Deferred acquisition costs for traditional long-duration contracts are amortised over the life of underlying contracts based upon the present value of gross premiums. Deferred acquisition costs for universal-life type contracts and similar products are amortised based on the present value of estimated gross profits. Estimated gross profits are updated quarterly.",

        "page_content": "## Modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts\n\nThe Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially unchanged contract  as a continuation of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs and present value of future profits (PVFP) will continue to be amortised. The Group accounts for modifications of insurance and reinsurance contracts that result in a substantially changed  contract as an extinguishment of the replaced contract. The associated deferred acquisition costs or PVFP are written off immediately through income and any new deferrable costs associated with the replacement contract are deferred.\n\n## Business combinations\n\nThe Group applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. This method allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.\n\nThe underlying assets and liabilities acquired are subsequently accounted for according to the relevant US GAAP guidance. This includes specific requirements applicable to subsequent accounting for assets and liabilities recognised as part of the acquisition me thod of accounting, including present value of future profits, goodwill and other intangible assets.\n\n## Acquired present value of future profits\n\nThe acquired present value of future profits (PVFP) of business in force is recorded in connection with the acquisition of li fe and health business. The initial value is calculated as the difference between established reserves, which are set up in line with US GAAP accounting policies and assumptions of the Group, and their fair value at the acquisition date. The resulting PVFP, which could be posit ive or negative, is amortised on a constant yield basis over the expected revenue recognition period of the business acquired, generally over per iods ranging up to 30 years, with the accrual of interest added to the unamortised balance at the earned rate. Amorti sation and accrual of interest are recognised in acquisition costs. The earned rate corresponds to either the current earned rate or the original earned rate depending on the business written. The rate is consistently applied for the entire life of the app licable business. For universal-life and similar products, PVFP is amortised in line with estimated gross profits, which are updated quarterly. The carrying value of PVFP is reviewed periodica lly for indicators of impairment in value. Adjustments to PVFP reflecting impairment in value are recognised in acquisition costs during the period in which the determination of impairment is made, or in other comprehensive income for shadow loss recognition.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nThe excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of 30 September, unless there is an event or circumstances which makes an impairment more likely than not. Adjustments to reflect impairment in value are recognised in earnings in the period in which the determination of impairment is made.\n\n## Other assets\n\nOther assets include deferred expenses on retroactive reinsurance, prepaid reinsurance premiums, receivables related to investing activities, real estate for own use, other classes of property, plant and equipment, lease right -of-use asset, accrued income, certain intangible assets and prepaid assets.\n\nThe excess of estimated liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses payable over consideration received in respect of retroactive property and casualty reinsurance contracts is recorded as a deferred expense. The deferred expense on retroactive reinsuranc e contracts is amortised through earnings over the expected claims-paying period.\n\nReal estate for own use as well as other classes of property, plant and equipment are carried at depreciated cost. Depreciati on on buildings is recognised on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life. Land is recognised at cost and not depreciated.\n\n## Leases\n\nThe Group recognises for finance and operating leases a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right -of-use asset representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The lease right-of-use asset is included in 'other assets' and the lease liability is included in 'accrued expenses and other liabilities' on the balance sheet. Lease expense for lease payments is r ecognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\n\nAdditional disclosures are provided in Note 13 'Leases'.\n\n## Capitalised software costs\n\nExternal direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop or obtain software for internal use, payroll and payroll -related costs for employees directly associated with software development and interest cost incurred while developing software for internal use are capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis through earnings over the estimated useful life.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognised based on the difference between financial statement carrying amounts and the corresponding income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is re corded against deferred tax assets when it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realised.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\nThe Group recognises the effect of income tax positions only if sustaining those positions is more likely than not. Changes i n recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which a change in judgement occurs. Interest and penalties related to unrecognised tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense.\n\nThe Group releases stranded tax effects for unrealised gains/losses on AFS securities to earnings on a straight -line basis over the average duration of the relevant AFS portfolio as an approximation of when the individual securities within the portfolio are sold or mature. For adjustment for pension and other post-retirement benefits, stranded tax effects are released to earnings when the relevant pension p lan is terminated. For foreign currency translation, stranded tax effects are released to earnings in line with the recycling of the  underlying foreign currency translation amounts.\n\n## Unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n\nLiabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses for property and casualty and for life and health insurance and reinsurance contracts are accrued when insured events occur and are based on the estimated ultimate cost of settling the claims, using re ports and individual case estimates received from ceding companies. Reserves also are established for claims incurred but not reported, which are developed on the basis of past experience adjusted for current trends and other factors that modify past experience. The esta blishment of the appropriate level of reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and judgements made by management, a nd therefore there can be no assurance that ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses will not exceed the loss reserves curr ently established by the Group. These estimates are regularly reviewed, and adjustments for differences between estimates and actual payments for clai ms and for changes in estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the estimates are changed o r payments are made.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created additional uncertainty, both in respect of estimation of claims across the insurance and reinsurance industry and assessments of the wider potential global health and economic impacts. This uncertainty has been compounded by the evolving nature of the pandemic, including the spread of new strains of the virus, and is driven, among other factors, by lac k of definitive answers about the impacts of the pandemic and related mitigation efforts on economies a nd societies across the globe, the efficacy of vaccines and other treatments, and the long-term health and social impacts of the pandemic on populations, as well as by evolving responses of governments and regulators, responses of businesses and outcomes of legal actions that have already been brought or may in the future be brought. The Group has recorded its best estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred as a result of the pandemic as at 31 December 2021, which best estimate reflects the Group's expectations based on current facts and circumstances. However, the Group may, as a result of the myriad uncertainties, need to change its estimates for claims incurred and additio nal future claims over time as underlying facts develop.\n\nThe Group does not discount liabilities arising from prospective property and casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts, including liabilities which are discounted for US statutory reporting purposes. Liabilities arising from property and casualty insuranc e and reinsurance contracts acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at fair value in accordance with the acquisition method  of accounting.\n\nThe Group does not discount life and health claim reserves except for disability income claims in payment  and mortality claims paid out in the form of an annuity. These claims are recognised at the estimated present value of the remaining ultimate net costs of the  incurred claims.\n\nExperience features which are directly linked to a reinsurance asset or liabili ty are classified in a manner that is consistent with the presentation of that asset or liability.\n\n## Liabilities for life and health policy benefits\n\nLiabilities for life and health policy benefits from reinsurance business are generally calculated using the net level premium method, based on assumptions as to investment yields, mortality, morbidity, withdrawals, lapses and policyholder dividends. Assumptions are se t at the time the contract is issued or, in the case of contracts acquired by purchase, at t he acquisition date. The assumptions are based on current best estimates, making allowance for possible adverse deviation. Interest rate assumptions for life and health (re)insurance benefit liabilities are based on estimates of expected investment yields. Assumed mortality or morbidity rates are generally based on experience multiples applied to the actuarial select and ultimate tables based on industry experience.\n\n## Policyholder account balances\n\nPolicyholder account balances relate to universal-life-type contracts and investment contracts.\n\nUniversal-life-type contracts are long-duration insurance contracts, providing either death or annuity benefits, with terms that are not fixed and guaranteed.\n\nInvestment contracts are long-duration contracts that do not incorporate significant insurance risk, i.e. there is no mortality and morbidity risk, or the mortality and morbidity risk associated with the insurance benefit features offered in the contract is of insign ificant amount or remote probability. Amounts received as payment for investment contracts are reported as policyholder account balances. Related assets are included in general account assets except for investments for unit-linked, which are presented in a separate line item on the face of the balance sheet.\n\nAmounts assessed against policyholders for mortality, administration and surrender are reported as fee income. Amounts credit ed to policyholders are reported as interest credited to policyholders. Investment income and realised investment gains and losses allocable to",

Additional disclosures are provided in Note 7 'Investments'.\n\n## Funds held assets and liabilities\n\nOn the asset side, funds held by ceding companies consist mainly of amounts retained by the ceding company for business writt en on a funds withheld basis. In addition, the account also includes amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of ac counting to ceded retrocession or reinsurance contracts.\n\nOn the liability side, funds held under reinsurance treaties consist m ainly of amounts arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting to inward insurance and reinsurance contracts. In addition, the account also includes amounts retained from ceded business written on a funds withheld basis.\n\nFunds withheld assets are assets that would normally be paid to the Group but are withheld by the cedent to reduce a potential credit risk or to retain control over investments. In case of funds withheld liabilities, it is the Group that withholds assets related to ceded business in order to reduce its credit risk or retain control over the investments.\n\nThe deposit method of accounting is applied to insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not indemnify the ceding company o r the Group against loss or liability relating to insurance risk. Under the deposit method of accounting, the deposit asset or liab ility is initially measured based on the consideration paid or received. For contracts that transfer neither significant timing nor underwriting risk, an d contracts that transfer only significant timing risk, changes in estimates of the timing or amounts o f cash flows are accounted for by recalculating the effective yield. The deposit is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the contract. The revenue and expense recorded for such contracts is included in net investment income. For contracts that transfer only significant underwriting risk, once a loss is incurred, the deposit is adjusted by the present value of the inc urred loss. At each subsequent balance sheet date, the portion of the deposit attributable to the incurred loss is recalculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows. The resulting changes in the carrying amount of the deposit are recognised in claims and claim adjustment expense s.\n\nFunds withheld balances are presented together with assets and liabilities arising from the application of the deposit method because of their common deposit-type character.\n\n## Premium deficiency testing\n\nThe level of the premium deficiency test is at the segment level or separate business within Group Items. The testing is performed net of external retrocessions.\n\nFor long duration contracts, liabilities for life and health policy benefits are increased with a charge to earnings if there  is a premium deficiency. A premium deficiency exists if the liability for future policy benefits calculated using best estimate cash flows, including investment income, is higher than the net GAAP liability. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferred acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition costs, then an addi tional liability will be established for the difference. In connection with the premium deficiency testing, an analysis is performe d to determine that profits will not be followed by losses. The best estimate cash flows by year along with the change in the locked in GAAP rese rve are reviewed to determine that there are not any profits followed by losses. If so, an additional GAAP rese rve is established by calculating the portion of future premiums required to be used as an additional reserve to offset the future losses.\n\nFor short duration contracts, a premium deficiency exists when the unearned premium plus expected investment income i s less than the total of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses, related estimated policy maintenance costs (incl. ULAE), related  unamortised acquisition costs and expected dividends to policyholders. If a premium deficiency exists, the deferre d acquisition costs for the related business segment will be expensed to the extent of the deficiency. If the deficiency is greater than the deferred acquisition  cost, then a liability will be established for the difference.\n\n## Shadow adjustments\n\nShadow adjustments are recognised in other comprehensive income reflecting the offset of adjustments to deferred acquisition costs and PVFP, typically related to universal-life-type contracts, and policyholder liabilities. The purpose is to reflect the fact that certain amounts recorded as unrealised investment gains and losses within shareholders' equity will ultimately accrue to policyholders and no t shareholders.\n\nShadow loss recognition testing becomes relevant in low interest rate environments. The test considers w hether the hypothetical sale of AFS securities and the reinvestment of proceeds at lower yields would lead to negative operational earnings in future periods, th ereby causing a loss recognition event. For shadow loss recognition testing, the Group uses current market yields to determine best estimate US GAAP reserves rather than using locked-in or current book yields. If the unlocked best estimate US GAAP reserves based on current market rates are in excess of reserves based on locked-in or current book yields, a shadow loss recognition reserve is set up. These reserves are recognised in other comprehensive income and do not impact net income. In addition, shadow loss recognition reserves can reve rse up to the amount of losses recognised due to past loss events.",

        "page_content": "## Premiums\n\nProperty and casualty reinsurance premiums are recorded when written and include an estimate for written premiums receivable  at period end. Premiums earned are generally recognised in income over the contract period in proportion to the amoun t of reinsurance provided. Unearned premiums consist of the unexpired portion of reinsurance provided. Life reinsurance premiums are earned when due. Re lated policy benefits are recorded in relation to the associated premium or gross profits so that profit s are recognised over the expected lives of the contracts.\n\nLife and health reinsurance premiums for group coverages are generally earned over the term of the coverage. For group contra cts that allow experience adjustments to premiums, such premiums are recognised as the related experience emerges.\n\nReinstatement premiums are due where coverage limits for the remaining life of the contract are reinstated under pre -defined contract terms. The recognition of reinstatement premiums as written depends on individual contract features. Reinstatement premiums are either recognised as written at the time a loss event occurs or in line with the recognition pattern of premiums written of the unde rlying contract. The accrual of reinstatement premiums is based on actuarial estimates of ultimate losses. Reinstatement premiums are generally earned in proportion to the amount of reinsurance provided.\n\n## Insurance and reinsurance ceded\n\nThe Group uses retrocession arrangements to increase its aggregate underwriting capacity, to diversify its risk and to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss on reinsurance assumed. The ceding of risks to retrocessionaires does not relieve the Group of its obligati ons to its ceding companies. The Group regularly evaluates the financial condition of its retrocessionaires and monitors the concentration of credit risk to minimise its exposure to financial loss from retrocessionaires' insolvency. Premiums and losses ceded under retrocession cont racts are reported as reductions of premiums earned and claims and claim adjustment expenses. Amounts recoverable for ceded short- and longduration contracts, including universal-life-type and investment contracts, are reported as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n\nThe Group provides reserves for uncollectible amounts on reinsurance balances ceded, based on management's assessment of the collectability of the outstanding balances.\n\n## Receivables\n\nPremium and claims receivables which have been invoiced are accounted for at face value. Toget her with assets arising from the application of the deposit method of accounting that meet the definition of financing receivables they are regularly assessed for impairm ent. Evidence of impairment is the age of the receivable and/or any financial difficulties of the counterparty. Allowances are set up on the net balance, meaning all balances related to the same counterparty are considered. The amount of the allowance is set up in relation to th e time a receivable has been due and any financial difficulties of the debtor and can be as high as the outstanding net balance.\n\n## Pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\nThe Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs using the accrual method of accounting. Amounts charged to expense are based on periodic actuarial determinations.\n\n## Share-based payment transactions\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Group has a Leadership Performance Plan (LPP)/Leadership Share Plan (LSP), restricted shares and a Global Share Participation Plan. These plans are described in more detail in Note 17 'Share-based payments'. The Group accounts for share-based payment transactions with employees using the fair value method. Under the fair value method, the fair value of the awards is  recognised in earnings over the vesting period.\n\nFor share-based compensation plans which are settled in cash, compensation costs are recognised as liabilities, whereas for equity -settled plans, compensation costs are recognised as an accrual to additional paid-in capital within shareholders' equity.\n\n## Treasury shares\n\nTreasury shares are reported at cost in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Earnings per common share\n\nBasic earnings per common share are determined by dividing net income available to shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares entitled to dividends during the year. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the effect on earnings and average common shares outstanding associated with dilutive securities.\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 16 March 2022. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.\n\n## Adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, 'Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes', an update to Topic 740, 'Income Taxes'.

The Grou p adopted the standard on 1 January 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, 'Clarifying the Interactions between Topic 321, Topic 323, and Topic 815', an update to Topic 321, 'Investments - Equity Securities', Topic 323, 'Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures', and Topic 815 'Derivatives and Hedging'. The amendments clarify that an entity should consider observable transactions that result in either applying or discontinuing the equity method of accounting for the purpose of applying the measurement alternative in Topic 321. In addition, the amendments cla rify that when determining the accounting for nonderivative forward contracts and purchased options, an entity should not consider whether the underlying securities would be accounted for under the equity method or fair value option upon settlement or exercise, for th e purposes of evaluating characteristic (a) in ASC 815-10-15-141.The Group adopted the standard on 1 January 2021. The adoption did not have an impact on the Group's financial statements.\n\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, 'Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. In response to concerns about structural risks of interbank offered rates (IBORs) and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), regulators in several jurisdictions around the world have und ertaken reference rate reform initiatives to identify alternative reference rates. The amendments in this update provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying US GAAP accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that referen ce LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of these reference rate reform initiatives. The Group adopted ASU 2020 -04 on 12 March 2020, which is the issuance date of the standard. There is a choice to apply the guidance by Topic or industry Subto pic at any time prospectively during the effective period from 12 March 2020 through 31 December 2022. As of 31 December 2021, the Group appl ied the guidance to Topic 815 related to Group's adherence to the ISDA 2020 Fallbacks Protocol, which is a standardized appro ach for amending contracts in order to incorporate IBOR fallback provisions and related to changes to the critical terms of a hedging relation ship due to reference rate reform as well as to Topic 944 related to changes resulting from the replacement of dis continued reference rates included in contracts within the scope of Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'.\n\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, 'Scope', an update to Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform'. Because of the broad population of derivatives affected by the market-wide transition to new reference rates (commonly referred to as the 'discounting transition'), stakeholders analysed the accounting implications of the discounting transition against the available exceptions and expedients within Topic 848, 'Reference Rate Reform', which led them to raise questions about the scope of that Topic. The amendments clar ify the scope of Topic 848 and allow entities to apply certain optional provisions in Topic 848 to derivative instruments that unde rgo a modification of the interest rate used for margining, discounting, or contract price alignment because of the discounting transition that do not also reference LIBOR or another reference rate that is expected to be discontinued as a result of referen ce rate reform. The Group adopted ASU 2021-01 on a prospective basis from 1 January 2021.\n\n## Future adoption of new accounting standards\n\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, 'Measurement of Credit Losses', an update to Topic 326, 'Financial Instruments - Credit Losses'. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current US GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses. The standard is applicable to all financial assets such as financial instruments that are measured at amortised cost, available for-sale debt securities and reinsurance recoverables. The objective of the expected credit loss model is that a reporting entity  recognises its estimate of expected credit losses incorporating forward-looking information in a valuation allowance for financial assets in scope. As amended by ASU 2019-10 'Effective Dates', ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. For most affected financial assets, the ASU must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach, with a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to opening retained earnings on the adoption date. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new requiremen ts.\n\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, 'Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment', an update to Topic 350, 'Intangibles Goodwill and Other'. This ASU simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill and eliminates Step 2 from the goodwill impai rment test. In computing the implied fair value of goodwill under Step 2, an entity has to perform procedures to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities (including unrecognised assets and liabilities) at the impairment testing date following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Instead, under the amendments in this update, an entity should perform its regular goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with it s carrying amount. An entity should recognise an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair  value; however, the loss recognised should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. As amen ded by ASU 2019-10 'Effective Dates', ASU 2017-04 is effective for goodwill impairment tests in annual and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2022. Early application of the ASU is permitted. The Group is currently assessing the impact of the new requirements.\n\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-12, 'Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts', an update to Topic 944, 'Financial Services - Insurance'. This ASU requires that the cash flows and net premium ratio will be updated for changes in insurance assumptions (eg mortality, morbidity, terminations) when measuring the liability for future policy benefits for nonparticipat ing traditional and limited-payment insurance and reinsurance contracts. There will no longer be a provision for adverse deviation. In addition, the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the liability for future policy benefits will be standardised. Further, the ASU requires deferred acquisition costs (DAC) relating to most long-duration contracts to be amortised on a constant basis over the expected term of the contract. As amended by ASU 2020-11 'Effective Date and Early Application', ASU 2018-12 is effective for annual periods beginning after 15 December 2024, and interim periods beginning after 15 December 2025.

The business segments are determined by the organisational structure and by the way in which management reviews the operating performance of the Group.\n\nThe Group presents three core operating business segments: Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions. The assignment of assets and liabilities for entities that span more than one segment is determined by considering  local statutory requirements, legal and other constraints, the economic view of duration and currency requirements of the reinsurance busines s written and the capacity of the segments to absorb risks. Interest expense is based on the segment's capital funding p osition. The tax impact of a segment is derived from the legal entity tax obligations and the segmentation of the pre -tax result. While most of the tax items can be directly attributed to individual segments, the tax within an entity which impacts two or more segments is allocated to the segments based on the applicable statutory tax rate on pre-tax income or loss with permanent tax differences specifically allocated to the applicable segments. Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance share the same year-to-date effective tax rate as both business segments belong to the Reinsurance Business Unit.\n\nAccounting policies applied by the business segments are in line with those described in the summary of significant accountin g policies (please refer to Note 1). Cross-segmental dividends and gains and losses on certain one-off transfers and transactions between segments are accounted for through segmental shareholders' equity.\n\nThe Group operating segments are outlined below.\n\n## Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Life & Health Reinsurance\n\nReinsurance consists of two segments, Property & Casualty and Life & Health. The Reinsurance Business Unit operates globally,  both through brokers and directly with clients, and provides a large range of solutions for risk and capital management. Clients include stock and mutual insurance companies as well as public sector and governmental entities. In addition to traditional reinsurance solutions, Rei nsurance offers insurance-linked securities and other insurance-related capital market products in both Property & Casualty and Life & Health.\n\nProperty & Casualty includes the business lines property, casualty (including motor) and specialty. Life & Health includes th e life and health lines of business.\n\n## Corporate Solutions\n\nCorporate Solutions offers innovative insurance capacity to mid- to large-sized corporations across the globe. Offerings range from standard risk transfer covers and multi-line programmes to highly customised solutions tailored to the needs of clients. Corporate Solutions serves customers from offices worldwide.\n\n## Life Capital\n\nAs of 1 January 2021, the Life Capital reporting segment ceased to be managed as a separate Business Unit. Life Capital manag ed the Group's primary life and health business as well as its primary retail property and casualty business. It encompassed the closed and open life and health insurance books, including the ReAssure business sold in 2020 (please refer to Note 10 of the 2020 Annual Report f or further details on the disposal of ReAssure Group plc.) and the business comprising elipsLife and iptiQ. In 2021, iptiQ operates as a stand -alone division, and is reported as part of the Group items reporting segment. elipsLife moved to the Corporate Solutions reporting segment. Comparative information for 2020 has been adjusted accordingly. The Life Capital reporting segment for the comparative period 2020 reflects the ReAssure business.\n\n## Group items\n\nGroup items includes iptiQ, which operates as a standalone division, with results reported within the Group items segment. Group items also includes items not allocated to the business segments, which encompass Principal Investments, Swiss Re Ltd, the Group's ultim ate parent company, certain Treasury units and reinsurance and insurance business in run-off. iptiQ partners with distributors providing Swiss Re access to risk pools offering white-labelled protection cover in both the life and health as well as property and casualty businesses. Swiss Re Ltd charges trademark licence fees to the business segments which are reported as other revenues. Certain administrative expenses of the corporate centre functions that are not recharged to the operating segments are reported as Group items.\n\n## Consolidation\n\nSegment information is presented net of external and internal retrocession and other intra-group arrangements. The Group total is obtained after elimination of intra-group transactions in the 'Consolidation' column. This includes significant intra-group reinsurance arrangements, recharge of trademark licence fees and intersegmental funding.",

        "page_content": "## Financial statements\n\n## Prior-year development\n\nNon-life claims development on prior years in the year ended 31 December 2021 is mainly driven by favourable property experience  partly offset by adverse casualty experience. Development in property is principally due to reserve releases related to natural catastrophe events and lower than expected claims activity, mostly in North America and Asia. The deterioration for casualty mainly comes from a dverse development for liability in North America and cyber, partly offset by favourable development in workers' compensation. Specialty was impacted by positive claims experience mainly in credit and engineering, partly offset by adverse development in marine and a viation.\n\nFor life and health lines of business, development on prior years' unpaid claims in the year ended 31 December 2021 is favourable. For life business, there is favourable development in Continental Europe and the UK. For health business, there is unfavourable develo pment in disability portfolios in the US and Australia driven by adverse experience and strengthening of claim reserves. Claims develo pment related to prior years for disability portfolios also includes an element of interest accretion for unpaid claims repo rted at an estimated present value.\n\nA summary of prior year net claims and claim adjustment expenses development by lines of business for the years ended 31 December is shown below 1 :\n\n| USD millions      | 2020   | 2021   |\n|-------------------|--------|--------|\n| Line of business: |        |        |\n| Property          | -582   | -918   |\n| Casualty          | 456    | 473    |\n| Specialty         | 26     | -255   |\n| Life and health   | 266    | -27    |\n| Total             | 166    | -727   |\n\n## US asbestos and environmental claims exposure\n\nThe Group's obligation for claims payments and claims settlement charges also includes obligations for long -latent injury claims arising out of policies written prior to 1986, in particular in the area of US asbestos and environmental liability.\n\nAt the end of 2021, the Group carried net reserves for US asbestos and environmental liabilities equal to USD 1 430 million. During 2021, the Group incurred net losses of USD 106 million and net paid losses of USD 102 million in relation to these liabilities. The se amounts include unallocated loss adjustment expenses.\n\nEstimating ultimate asbestos and environmental liabilities is particularly complex for a number of reasons relating in part t o the long period between exposure and manifestation of claims, and in part to other factors, which include risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, changes in projected costs to resolve, and in the projected number of, asbestos and environmental claims, the eff ect of bankruptcy protection, insolvencies, and changes in the legal, legislative and regulatory environment. As a result, the Group believes that projection of exposures for asbestos and environmental claims is subject to far less predictability relative to non-environmental and non-asbestos exposures. Management believes that its reserves for asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts and the current state of the law. However, reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as  claims develop. Additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of reserves, and the Group's estimate of claims and claim adjustment expens es may change. Any such additional liabilities or increases in estimates cannot be reasonably estimated in advance but could result  in charges that could be material to operating results.",

        "page_content": "## Short duration contract unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses\n\n## Basis of presentation for claims development information\n\nThis section of the note provides claims development information and information on reserves for claims relating to insured events that have been incurred but not yet reported ('IBNR').\n\nClaims development information and IBNR are presented on an accident year basis and by line of business for individually sign ificant categories. Additional aggregation or disaggregation is provided where appropriate, necessary and practicable ('disaggregation categories'). For instance, Reinsurance liability and motor lines of business are further disaggregated into proportional and  non-proportional treaty types to provide more specific information on claims development. Amounts shown in the claims development tables are o n a nominal basis, including cases where the Group discounts claims liabilities for measurement under US GAAP, and are net of ex ternal retrocession and retrocession between business segments to the extent that a retrocession programme can be allocated to a disaggregation category. Ceded retroactive reinsurance is not included in the claims development table if it cannot be allocate d on a reasonable basis to the disaggregation categories used to present claims development information. Loss portfolio transfers are presented prospectively as reliable historical claims information is not always obtainable, or the data is incomplete and of insufficient quality.\n\nIn the Property & Casualty Reinsurance segment as well as for the non-life business in the Corporate Solutions segment, all contracts that transfer significant insurance risk are included in scope to the extent they can be allocate d to a disaggregation category. For many reinsurance contracts, proportional contracts in particular, ceding companies do not report losses by accident year. In these  cases, the Group has allocated reported losses by underwriting year to accident year to p roduce the accident year tables. Similarly, IBNR is calculated on an underwriting year basis and then the liabilities are allocated to accident year.\n\nLife & Health contracts that are not expected to remain in force for an extended period are classified as short duration contracts. These provide insurance protection for a fixed short duration and their provisions may be subject to changes at the end of contract  period, such as adjustments to the premium charged or the coverage provided. Examples of short dur ation contracts in the Life & Health Reinsurance segment include group life business, certain types of disability and long-term care contracts, group accident, and health coverage including critical illness and medical expenses. The Group provides claims development information for Life & Health Reinsurance where reported accident year information is available and there is potential for claims development. This primarily applies to the group dis ability business in Australia and the UK. This business is generally considered to have relatively higher claims estimation uncertainty than other life and health lines such as group life, due to longer claims development periods.\n\nThe Group provides no claims development information for the Group items segment as its short duration reserves are not material. This is also the case for Life & Health business in the Corporate Solutions segment, where short duration contracts mainly include di sability business.\n\nFor Property & Casualty Reinsurance, Life & Health Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions, the Group discloses data for ten accident years and reporting periods.\n\nThe Corporate Solutions business segment was created in 2012. Corporate Solutions related business written in Property & Casu alty Reinsurance prior to 2012 is included in the net claims development information reported by this segment. All but an immaterial portion of claims arising from accident years prior to 2012 relate to accident years which are over ten years ago and therefore out of t he required range of disclosure.\n\nThe current reporting period estimate of net claims liabilities for accident years older than the number of years shown in th e claims development tables is presented as a total after disclosure of cumulative paid claims.\n\nThe information presented in claims development tables is presented at current balance sheet foreign exchange rates as of the date of these financial statements to permit an analysis of claims development excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements.\n\nSome of the information provided in the following tables is Required Supplementary Information (RSI) under US GAAP and does not form part of these consolidated audited financial statements. Claims development information for all periods except the current re porting period and any information derived from it - including average annual percentage payout of claims incurred - is considered RSI and is identified as RSI in the tables presented.",

        "page_content": "## Methodology for determining the presented amounts of liabilities for unpaid claims\n\nThe liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses is based on an estimate of the ultimate cost of settling the claims  based on both information reported to us by ceding companies and internal estimates.\n\n## Non-life re/insurance contracts\n\nThe Group develops and recognises its own estimate of IBNR claims, which includes circumstances in which cedents have not reported any claims to the Group or where the Group's estimate of reserves needed to cover reported claims differs from the amounts report ed by cedents. For reinsurance business, case reserves and estimated IBNR are reported by cedents and this IBNR is presented together  with the Group's own estimate as IBNR in the claims development tables. For insurance business, reserving is performed similarly, e xcept that estimates for case reserves and IBNR are performed by the Group.\n\nReserving is done on portfolio or contract level depending on the features of the contract. For business reviewed on a portfo lio level, the expected ultimate losses are set for most lines and types of business based on analysis performed using standard actuarial techniques. In general, contracts are aggregated into portfolios by combining contracts with similar features, and ultimate losses are deriv ed using a blend of initial costing loss ratio and actual reported experience, with more weighting given to experience over time.\n\nThe initial reserving estimate uses a loss ratio projection method, where the projected loss ratio is generally the costing l oss ratio, reflecting the underwriter's view of the risk. In the case of new information regarding loss trends, rate changes or a different underwriter's estim ate, the projected loss ratio can be adjusted if approved by the Regional Reserving Committee. As experience develops, the most com mon standard reserving methods used are successively the Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Benktander and Chain Ladder methods. The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method assumes that the future claims experience is in line with the one anticipated by the costing loss ratio, use d as an a priori loss ratio, and not based on claims experience. The Benktander method is a weighted average of the Bornhuetter -Ferguson and Chain Ladder methods, where the weighted average is linked to the reported development pattern. In other terms, this method mainly follows the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method in the early stages and the Chain Ladder later on, progressively giving more weight to the experience. The Chain Ladder method assumes past trends will be repeated and extrapolates the current positio n to ultimate using historical development trends.\n\nIn most cases, these standard actuarial techniques encompass a number of loss development factor techniques applied to claim tables of paid and reported losses. Other actuarial techniques may be applicable  to specific categories, such as an analysis of frequency and severity. Life contingency techniques for projecting regular payments related to bodily injury claims are applied to motor proportional , motor nonproportional, liability proportional, liability non-proportional, accident and health and similar Corporate Solutions lines, where the information is available. In some cases, techniques specific to the projection of future payments for specific risks such as asbestos or pollution claims are applied to both proportional and non-proportional liability claims, also in Corporate Solutions (see also separate section 'US asbestos and environmental claims exposure' on page 233). Reserving for non-traditional business is carried out on a deal-by-deal basis according to each deal's specifications.  For large events, a separate process takes into consideration the relevant expertise from underw riting and claims functions in estimating the ultimate loss.\n\nContract-level reserving is based on standard actuarial techniques but requires more detailed contract, pricing, claim and exposure information than required for the business reviewed on a portfolio level.\n\n## Life and health re/insurance contracts\n\nFor the Life & Health business, liability for unpaid claims includes case reserves, IBNR, and provisions for disability incom e claims-inpayment. Estimates for case reserves allow for expected rates of decline for the not yet settled claims. IBNR claim res erves are calculated using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques, such as Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson approaches, and assumptions as to the claims reporting patterns, initial expected ultimate claims, and weighting given to historical experience. Liability for disability income claims-in-payment is determined by calculating expected future claim payments using the assumed rate of termination of claims due to death or recovery.\n\n## Claims frequency information\n\nClaims frequency information is not available for the disaggregation categories of Property & Casualty Reinsurance, as cedents do not report claims frequency information to the Group for most of the assumed reinsurance contract types.\n\nLife & Health Reinsurance reports claims frequency information based on individual incidence. The number of reported claims is the actual number of claims booked. For disability business, claims with multiple payments in a year are counted as one claim. Claims th at are reported but not recognised are included in the claim count.\n\nFor Corporate Solutions, claims frequency is displayed for direct business only, as individual claims information is generall y not available for assumed and ceded business. Claims are counted individually per contract to produce the  claims frequency table. For some direct business, summary reports are received, and multiple claims are booked under a single claim code; this is usually done at a programme, policy year, state, country and/or line of business level of detail. This approa ch may be applied to business which has a high volume of claim counts, but with only minor claims dollars associated with each claim.",

and Business Interruption) and Credit & Surety.\n\nReserves on the US liability line of business on accident years 2012-2019 were reduced by a Loss Portfolio Transfer to P&C Reinsurance of USD 1.2 billion in the financial year 2019. In addition, the impact of unfavourable development across all lines of business for acci dent years 2012-2018 was reduced by recoveries under an Adverse Development Cover with P&C Reinsurance in place since the second ha lf of the financial year 2019. For the financial year 2021, there were movements under both the Loss Portfolio Transfer and the Adverse  Development Cover mainly in the property and casualty lines of business.\n\nP&C Reinsurance reports both the Adverse Development Cover and the Loss Portfolio Transfer under accident year 2019 (see '' Property & Casualty Reinsurance - Liability, non-proportional'' on page 238).",

For details on consolidation please refer to Note 2 ''Information on business segments''.\n\nThe net outstanding liabilities correspond to the total liabilities for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses, net of r einsurance for each disaggregation category.\n\nOther short duration contract lines include reserves for business that is not material to the Group and where accident year i nformation is not available. For Life & Health Reinsurance, in certain markets, cedents do not provide sufficient information t o reinsurers to split claims incurred and claims paid by accident year. This is based on existing market practice. For these markets, an assessment of available in formation from other sources was made along with investigating approximations that could be used to provide claims development information by accident year. However, these alternate sources and estimates, based on currently available data and methods, could not be used to gen erate meaningful and representative accident year information and therefore have been excluded from disclosure. Other short duration contract lines also contain other treaties from Property & Casualty Reinsurance and Corporate Solutions which could not be allocated o n a consistent basis to disaggregation

The credit component of otherthan-temporary impairments is defined as the difference between a security's amortised cost basis and the present value of expected cash flows. Methodologies for measuring the credit component of impairment are aligned to market observer forecasts  of credit performance drivers. Management believes that these forecasts are representative of median market expectations.\n\nFor securitised products, cash flow projection analysis is conducted by integrating forward -looking evaluation of collateral performance drivers, including default rates, prepayment rates and loss severities and deal-level features, such as credit enhancement and prioritisation among tranches for payments of principal and interest. Analytics are differentiated by asset class, product ty pe and security-level differences in historical and expected performance. For corporate bonds and hybrid debt instruments, an expected loss approach based on d efault probabilities and loss severities expected in the current and forecasted economic environment is used for securities identified as creditimpaired to project probability-weighted cash flows. Expected cash flows resulting from these analyses are discounted, and the present value is compared to the amortised cost basis to determine the credit component of other-than-temporary impairments.\n\nA reconciliation of other-than-temporary impairments related to credit losses recognised in earnings was as follows:\n\n| USD millions                                                                                                                                                                                                         | 2020   |   2021 |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|\n| Balance as of 1 January                                                                                                                                                                                              | 61     |     46 |\n| Credit losses for which an other-than-temporary impairment was not previously recognised                                                                                                                             | 18     |      5 |\n| Reductions for securities sold during the period                                                                                                                                                                     | -32    |    -10 |\n| Increase of credit losses for which an other-than-temporary impairment has been recognised previously, when the  Group does not intend to sell, or more likely than not will not be required to sell before recovery |        |      5 |\n| Impact of increase in cash flows expected to be collected                                                                                                                                                            | -2     |     -1 |\n| Impact of foreign exchange movements                                                                                                                                                                                 | 1      |     -1 |\n| Balance as of 31 December                                                                                                                                                                                            | 46     |     44 |",

The fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for eac h financial instrument received or pledged by the Group. Management believes that master netting agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure. Upon occurrence of an event of default, the non -defaulting party may set off the obligation against collateral received regardless if it has been offset on the balance sheet prior to the defaulting event. The net amounts of the financial assets and liabilities presented on the balance sheet were recognised in 'Other invested assets', 'I nvestments for unit-linked and with-profit business' and 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities'.\n\n## Assets pledged\n\nAs of 31 December 2020 and 2021, investments with a carrying value of USD 5 858 million and USD 5 974 million, respectively, were on deposit with regulatory agencies in accordance with local requirements, of which USD 249 million and USD 244 million, respectively, were cash and cash equivalents.

This three-level hierarchy is based on the observability of the inputs used in the fair value measurement. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1 inputs are unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group has the ability to access. Level 1 inputs are the most persuasive evidence of fair value and are to be used whenever possible. The types of instruments include most US government and sovereign obligations, active listed equities, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments and most money market securities.\n\nLevel 2 inputs are market-based inputs that are directly or indirectly observable, but not considered level 1 quoted prices. Level 2 inputs consist of (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in non -active markets (eg markets which have few transactions and where prices are not current or price quotations vary substantially); (ii i) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable (eg interest rates, yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, credit risks and default rates); (iv) inputs derived from, or corroborated by, observable market data; and (v) quoted prices provided by third pa rty brokers. The types of instruments that trade in markets that are not considered to be active include most government agency securities, investment-grade corporate bonds, certain mortgage- and asset-backed products, certain exchange-traded derivative instruments, catastrophe bonds, less liquid listed equities and state, municipal and provincial obligations.\n\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable inputs. These inputs reflect the Group's own assumptions about market pricing using the best internal and external information available. Certain financial instruments are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. Such instruments include private equity, less liquid corpora te debt securities and certain asset-backed securities (ABS). Certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives trade in less liquid markets with limited pricing information, and the determination of fair value for these derivatives is inherently more difficult. Wh en appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid/offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on a vailable market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimate is used.\n\nPursuant to the election of the fair value option, the Group classifies certain liabilities for life and health policy benefits in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When appropriate, valuations are adjusted for various factors such as liquidity, bid /offer spreads and credit considerations. Such adjustments are generally based on available market evidence. In the absence of such evidence, management's best estimat e is used.\n\nThe fair values of assets are adjusted to incorporate the counterparty risk of non-performance. Similarly, the fair values of liabilities reflect the risk of non-performance of the Group, captured by the Group's credit spread. These valuation adjustments from assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs are recognised in net realised gains and losses. For 2021, these adjustments were not material. Whenever the underlying assets or liabilities are reported in a specific business segment, the valuation a djustment is allocated accordingly. Valuation adjustments not attributable to any business segment are reported in Group items.\n\nIn certain situations, the Group uses inputs to measure the fair value of asset or liability positions that fall into differe nt levels of the fair value hierarchy. In these situations, the Group will determine the appropriate level based on the lowest level input that is signif icant to the determination of the fair value.\n\n## Valuation techniques\n\nUS government securities typically have quoted market prices in active markets and are categorised as level 1 instruments in the  fair value hierarchy. Non-US government holdings are generally classified as level 2 instruments and are valued on the basis of the quotes provided by pricing services, which are subject to the Group's pricing validation reviews and pricing vendor challenge process. Valuations provided by pricing vendors are generally based on the actual trade information as substantially all of the Group's non-US government holdings are traded in a transparent and liquid market.\n\nCorporate debt securities mainly include US and European investment-grade positions, which are priced on the basis of quotes provided by third party pricing vendors and first utilise valuation inputs from activel y traded securities, such as bid prices, bid spreads to Treasury securities, Treasury curves and same or comparable issuer curves and spreads. Issuer spreads are determined from actual quotes and traded prices and incorporate considerations of credit/default, sector composition, and liquidity and call features. Where market data is not available, valuations are developed based on the modelling techniques that utilise observable inputs and option-adjusted spreads and incorporate considerations of the security's seniority, maturity and the issuer's corporate structure.\n\nValues of mortgage- and asset-backed securities are obtained both from third party pricing vendors and through quoted prices, some of which may be based on the prices of comparable securities with similar structural and collateral features. Values of certain ABS for which there are no significant observable inputs are developed using benchmarks to similar transactions or indices. For both residential mortgagebacked securities (RMBS) and commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS), cash flows are derived based on the transaction-specific",

For certain RMBS and CMBS with low levels of market liquidity, judgements may be required to determine comparable securities based on the loan type and deal-specific performance. CMBS terms may also incorporate lock-out periods that restrict borrowers from prepaying the loans or provide disincentives to prepay and therefore reduce prepayment risk of these securities, compared to RMBS. The fac tors specifically considered in valuation of CMBS include borrower-specific statistics in a specific region, such as debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios, as well as the type of commercial property. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities also includes debt securitised by credit card, student loan and auto loan receivables. Pricing inputs for these securities also focus on captur ing, where relevant, collateral quality and performance, payment patterns and delinquencies.\n\nThe Group uses third party pricing vendor data to value agency securitised products, which mainly include collateralised mortgage obligations (CMO) and mortgage-backed government agency securities. The valuations generally utilise observable inputs consistent with those noted above for RMBS and CMBS.\n\nEquity securities held by the Group for proprietary investment purposes are mainly classified in le vel 1. Securities classified in level 1 are traded on public stock exchanges for which quoted prices are readily available.\n\nThe category 'Other invested assets' includes the Group's private equity and hedge fund investments which are made directly or via ownership of funds. Valuation of direct private equity investments requires significant management judgement due to the absence of quoted market prices and the lack of liquidity. Initial valuation is based on the acquisition cost, and is further refined based on the available market information for the public companies that are considered comparable to the Group's holdings in the private companies being valued, and the private company-specific performance indicators, both historic and projected. Subsequent valuations also reflect business or asset appraisals, as well as market transaction data for private an d public benchmark companies and the actual companies being valued, such as financing rounds and mergers and acquisitions activity. The Group's holdings in private equity and hedge funds are generally valued utilising net asset values (NAV), subject to adjustments, as deemed necessary, for restrictions on redemption (lock-up periods and amount limitations on redemptions). These investments are included under investments measured at net asset value as a practical expedient.\n\nThe Group holds both exchange-traded and OTC interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and equity derivative contracts for hedging and trading purposes. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives measured using observable exchange prices are classified in level 1. Long dated contracts may require adjustments to the exchange-traded prices which would trigger reclassification to level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. OTC derivatives are generally valued by the Group based on the internal models, which are consistent with industry  standards and practices, and use both observable (dealer, broker or market consensus prices, spot and forward rates, interest rate and credit curves and volatility indices) and unobservable inputs (adjustments for liquidity, inputs derived from the observable data based on the Group's judgements and assumptions).\n\nThe Group's OTC interest rate derivatives primarily include interest rate swaps, futures, options, caps and floors and are va lued based on the cash flow discounting models which generally utilise as inputs observable market yield curves and volatility assumptions.\n\nThe Group's OTC foreign exchange derivatives primarily include forward, spot and option contracts and are generally valued ba sed on the cash flow discounting models, utilising as main inputs observable foreign exchange forward curves.\n\nThe Group's investments in equity derivatives primarily include OTC equity option contracts on single or baskets of market indices and equity options on individual or baskets of equity securities, which are valued using internally developed models (such as the Black -Scholes type option pricing model and various simulation models) calibrated with the inputs, which include underlying spot prices, dividen d curves, volatility surfaces, yield curves and correlations between underlying assets.\n\nThe Group's OTC credit derivatives can include index and single-name credit default swaps. Plain vanilla credit derivatives, such as index and single-name credit default swaps, are valued by the Group based on the models consistent with the industry valuation standards for t hese credit contracts, and primarily utilise observable inputs published by market data sources, such as credit spreads and recovery rates. These valuation techniques warrant classification of plain vanilla OTC derivatives as level 2 financial instruments in the fair val ue hierarchy.",

A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement corporate debt securities is credit spread. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value m easurement. The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's private placement credit tenant leases is illiquidity premium. A significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) f air value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Group's OTC equity option referencing correlated equity indices is correlation. Where the Group is long correlation risk, a significant increase (decrease) in this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group is short correlation risk, a significant increase (decrease) in  this input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's variable annuity and fair valued guaranteed minimum death benefit (GMDB) contracts are: risk margin, volatility, lapse, mortality improvement rate and withdrawal rate. A signifi cant increase (decrease) in isolation in each of the following inputs: risk margin, volatility and withdrawal rate would have resulted in a signif icantly lower (higher) fair value of the Group's obligation. A significant increase (decrease) in isolation in lapse rate would, in  general, have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value of the Group's obligation due to the maturity of the contracts. Changes in the mortality improvement rate impact the fair value of the Group's obligation differently for living -benefit products, compared to death-benefit products. For the former, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality improvement rate (ie decrease (increase) in mortality) in isolation would  have resulted in a decrease (increase) in fair value of the Group's liability. For the latter, a significant increase (decrease) in the mortality improvement rate in isolation would have resulted in an increase (decrease) in fair value of the Group's liability.\n\nThe significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Group's weather contracts are risk margin, correlation, volatility and index value. Where the Group has a long position, a significant increase (decrease) in the risk margin input i n isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower ) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a long index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly higher (lower) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short position, a significant increase (decrease ) in the risk margin input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a s hort volatility or correlation position, a significant increase (decrease) in the correlation and volatility inputs would have resu lted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Where the Group has a short index position, an increase (decrease) in the index value input in isolation would have resulted in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.",

These investments have no contractual term and are generally held based on financial or strategic intent.\n\nPrivate equity and real estate funds generally have limitations imposed on the amount of redemptions from the fund during the redemption period due to illiquidity of the underlying investments. Fees may apply for redemptions or transferring of interest to other parties. Distributions are expected to be received from these funds as the underlying assets are liquidated . The period of time over which the underlying assets are expected to be liquidated is indeterminate as investees provide liquidation notices.\n\nThe redemption frequency of hedge funds varies depending on the manager as well as the nature of the underlying product. Additionally, certain funds may impose lock-up periods and redemption gates as defined in the terms of the individual investment agreement.\n\n## Fair value option\n\nThe fair value option under the Financial Instruments Topic permits the choice to measure specified financial assets and liab ilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The Group elected the fair value option for positions in the following line items:\n\n## Other invested assets\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for certain investments classified as equity method investees within other invested a ssets in the balance sheet. The Group applied the fair value option, as the investme nts are managed on a fair value basis. The changes in fair value of these elected investments are recorded in earnings.\n\n## Funds held by ceding companies\n\nFor operational efficiencies, the Group elected the fair value option for funds held by the cedent under three of its reinsurance agreements. The assets are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are reported as a component of earnings.\n\n## Liabilities for life and health policy benefits\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for existing GMDB reserves related to certain variable annuity contracts. The Group has applied the fair value option, as the equity risk associated with those contracts is managed on a fair value basis and it is economically  hedged with derivative options in the market.

Some of these positions need to be assessed in conjunction with the corresponding insurance business, whilst the fair value of some other positions does not differ materially from the carrying amount. Considering these circumstances for these positions, the Group presents the carrying amount as an approximation for the fair value. For certain commercial mortgage loans and infrastructure loans, which are included in mortgage loans and other loans respectively, the fair value can be estimated using discounted cash flow models which are b ased on discount curves and spread inputs that require management's judgement.\n\nInvestments in real estate are fair valued primarily by external appraisers based on proprietary discounted cash flow models  that incorporate applicable risk premium adjustments to discount yields and projected market rental income streams based  on market-specific data. These fair value measurements are classified in level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDebt positions, which are fair valued based on executable broker quotes or the discounted cash flow method using  observable inputs, are classified as level 2 measurements. Fair value of the majority of the Group's level 3 debt positions is judged to approximate carrying value due to the highly tailored nature of the obligation and short-notice termination provisions.",

The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and/or interest rate risk on planned or anticipated investment purchases, existi ng assets or liabilities, as well as locking in attractive investment conditions for future available funds.\n\nThe fair values represent the gross carrying value amounts at the reporting date for each class of derivative contract held o r issued by the Group. The gross fair values are not an indication of credit risk, as m any over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA master agreements or their equivalent. Management believes that such agreements provide for legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which substantially reduces credit exposure.",

These offset translation gains and losses on the hedged net investment.\n\n## Maximum potential loss\n\nIn consideration of the rights of set-off and the qualifying master netting arrangements with various counterparties, the maximum potential loss as of 31 December 2020 and 2021 was approximately USD 956 million and USD 583 million, respectively. The maximum potential loss is based on the positive market replacement cost assuming non-performance of all counterparties, excluding cash collateral.\n\n## Credit risk-related contingent features\n\nCertain derivative instruments held by the Group contain provisions that require its debt to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. If the Group's credit rating were downgraded or no longer rated, the counterparties could request immediate payment, guara ntee or an ongoing full overnight collateralisation on derivative instruments in net liability positions.\n\nThe total fair value of derivative financial instruments containing credit risk -related contingent features amounted to USD 71 million and USD 63 million as of 31 December 2020 and 2021, respectively. For derivative financial instruments containing credit risk-related contingent features, the Group posted collateral of USD 48 million and USD 36 million as of 31 December 2020 and 2021, respectively. In the event of a reduction of the Group's credit rating to below investment grade, a fair value of USD 30 million  additional collateral would have had to be posted as of 31 December 2021. The total equals the amount needed to settle the instruments immediately as of 31 December 2021.",

The net impact of the change in the fair value of the debt and interest rate swap is reflected in the interest expense line in the income statement but not in the table above. For more det ails on the hedging, please refer to Note 9 'Derivative financial instruments'.\n\n## Convertible debt\n\nIn June 2018, SRL issued six-year senior unsecured exchangeable notes with issuer stock settlement. The notes have a face value of USD 500 million, with a fixed coupon of 3.25% per annum, payable semi -annually in arrear until the maturity date (13 June 2024). Subject to the conditions of the notes, noteholders may exchange their notes for ordinary shares of SRL at an exchange price of USD 102.2844 (adjusted from the initial exchange price of USD 115.2593). The exchange price is subject to further adjustment in certain circumstances described in the conditions of the notes. The issuer may elect to settle a noteholder-initiated exchange in cash or SRL shares. To economically offset the settlement of a noteholder-initiated exchange, SRL purchased matching call options on SRL shares with a portion of the proceeds. Consequently, no new SRL shares will be issued upon a noteholder -initiated exchange. Assuming that all of the notes are exchanged at the request of noteholders, and subject to further adjustments to the exchange price as described in the conditions of the notes, 4 888 331 registered shares of SRL would have to be delivered to noteholders. Both the noteholder -initiated exchange option and the matching call options are accounted as equity within these financial statements.\n\n## Long-term debt issued in 2021\n\nNo long-term debt was issued in the year ended 31 December 2021.",

This translates into an effective tax rate in the current and prior-year reporting periods of 21.5% and 24.4%, respectively.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the tax rate was largely driven by profits earned in higher tax jurisdictions and tax ch arges from nondeductible expenses, partially offset by tax benefits from the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and foreign  currency translation differences between statutory and US GAAP accounts. The tax rate in the year ended 31 December 2020 was large ly driven by tax benefits from tax-exempt income and the release of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, partially offset by tax charges from intra entity transfers and foreign currency translation differences between statutory and US GAAP accounts.",

The Group ha s the intent and ability to control all distributions from foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner. Deferred tax liabilities or additional foreign withholding tax liabilities will be recognised if the Group can no longer demonstrate that it plans to indefinitely reinvest the undistri buted earnings. As of 31 December 2021, the US GAAP undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries was USD 3.5 billion. Due to the differences in US GAAP and local tax basis of undistributed earnings, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax liability if these earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.\n\nIn 2021, USD 725 million was distributed from a subsidiary where the earnings were planned to be permanently reinvested. No f oreign tax withholding liability arose from this distribution and no shareholder tax liability resulted due to the participation tax exemption rules.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Group had USD 14 636 million net operating tax loss carryforwards, expiring as follows: USD 3 mil lion in 2022, USD 6 million in 2023, USD 815 million in 2024, USD 411 million in 2025,  USD 7 473 million in 2026 and beyond and USD 5 928 million never expire.\n\nAs of 31 December 2021, the Group had capital loss carryforwards of USD 609 million that never expire.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, net operating tax losses of USD 1 995 mill ion and net capital tax losses of USD 28 million were utilised.\n\nThe valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2020 and 2021 was USD 395 million and USD 388 million, resp ectively. The net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended 31 December 2021 was a decrease of USD 7 million, with a USD 13 million decrease driven by balance sheet translation recorded in equity, a USD 42 million decrease from net releases included as tax benefit in income tax from operations, and a USD 48 million increase from tax rate changes included as a tax charge in income tax from operations.\n\nThe valuation allowance as of 31 December 2021 was primarily related to loss carryforwards and intangible assets that, in the  judgment of management, are not more likely than not to be realised. In assessing the realisability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised. The ultimate realisation of defe rred tax assets depends on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences are deductible.",

The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realisable, however, could be red uced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced.\n\nSubsequently recognised tax benefits related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of 31 December 2021 will b e allocated entirely to income tax from operations.\n\nIncome taxes paid in 2020 and 2021 were USD 364 million and USD 258 million, respectively.",

For the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2021, such benefits were USD 10 million and expenses were USD 1 million, respectively. For the years ended 31 December 2020 and 2021, USD 37 million and USD 38 million, respectively, were accrued for the payment of interest (net of tax benefits) and penalties. The accrued interest balance as of 31 December 2021 is included within the deferred and other non -current taxes section reflected above and in the balance sheet.\n\nThe balance of gross unrecognised tax benefits as of 31 December 2021 presented in the table above excludes accrued interest and penalties (USD 38 million).\n\nDuring the year, certain tax positions and audits in Switzerland were effectively settled.\n\nThe Group continually evaluates proposed adjustments by taxing authorities. The Group believes that it is reasonably possible (more than remote and less than likely) that the balance of unrecognised tax benefits could decrease by USD 62 million over the next 12 months due to settlements or expiration of statutes. It is also reasonably possible that balance could increase as a result of proposed adjus tments by taxing authorities. Quantification of an estimated range of increases cannot be made at this time.\n\nThe following table summarises jurisdictions and tax years that remain subject to examination:\n\n| Australia   | 2017-2021       |\n|-------------|-----------------|\n| Brazil      | 2014; 2016-2021 |\n| Canada      | 2014-2021       |\n| China       | 2011-2021       |\n| Colombia    | 2016-2021       |\n| Denmark     | 2015-2021       |\n| France      | 2019-2021       |\n| Germany     | 2017-2021       |\n| Hong Kong   | 2014-2021       |\n| India       | 2004; 2010-2021 |\n| Ireland     | 2016-2021       |\n| Israel      | 2016-2021       |\n| Italy       | 2017-2021       |\n| Japan       | 2019-2021       |\n\n| Korea          | 2013-2021   |\n|----------------|-------------|\n| Luxembourg     | 2017-2021   |\n| Malaysia       | 2021        |\n| Mexico         | 2016-2021   |\n| Netherlands    | 2016-2021   |\n| New Zealand    | 2016-2021   |\n| Nigeria        | 2016-2021   |\n| Singapore      | 2017-2021   |\n| Slovakia       | 2016-2021   |\n| South Africa   | 2015-2021   |\n| Spain          | 2017-2021   |\n| Switzerland    | 2017-2021   |\n| United Kingdom | 2018-2021   |\n| United States  | 2017-2021   |",

Employer contributions to the plans are charged to income on  a basis which recognises the costs of pensions over the expected service lives of employees covered by the plans. The Group's  funding policy for these plans is to contribute annually at a rate that is intended to maintain a level percentage of compensation for the employees covered. A full valuation is prepared at least every three years.\n\nThe Group also provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for retired employees and their dependants.  Generally employees become eligible for these benefits when they become eligible for pension benefits.\n\nThe measurement date of these plans is 31 December for each year presented.\n\n| 2020  USD

Tactical allocation decisions that reflect this strategy are made on a quarterly basis, including balancing the investment portfolios between equity and fixed income securities.",

Real estate reported on level 3 is property owned by the pension funds. These positions are accounted for at the  capitalised income value. The capitalisation based on sustainable recoverable earnings is conducted at interest rates that are determined individually for each property, based on the property's location, age and condition. If properties are intended for disposal, the estimated selling costs and taxes are recognised in provisions. Sales gains or losses are allocated to income from real estate when the contract is concluded.\n\nThe fair value of the insurance contract is based on the fair value of the assets backing the contract.\n\nAs of 31 December, the fair values of pension plan assets were as follows:\n\n|                            | Fair value                                                        | Fair value

For LPP 2018, LPP 2019,  LPP 2020 and LSP 2021 awards, an additional two-year holding period applies for all members of the Group EC and other key executives. At grant date, LPP 2018 and LPP 2019 awards were split equally into two underlying components of Performance Share Units (PSUs). The ROE PSUs are measured against a return on equity performance condition and will vest within a range of 0-100%. The TSR PSUs are based on relative total shareholder return, measured against a pre-defined group of peers and will vest within a range of 0-200%. At grant date, LPP 2020 was split equally into three underlying components of PSUs. The ENW PSUs, being the third component, are measured against ENW growth performance and will vest within a range of 0-100%. In 2021 the Leadership Share Plan (LSP) succeeded the LPP, whereby depending on the corporate band of the participant, the plan consists of either non-performance based components in the form of Share Units (SUs), three separate performance based components in the form of PSUs, similar to LPP 2020, each vesting within a range of 0 -150%, or a mix of both non-performance and performance based components. Each SU is entitled to a dividend equivalent (equal value to actual Swiss Re dividends), allocated annually and settled in shares at the end of the vesting period. The fair values of all components are determined separately, based on stochastic models.\n\nThe fair value assumptions in the grant valuations include market estimates for dividends and the risk-free rate based on the average of the 10-year US Treasury bond taken monthly over each year in the performance period, resulting in risk-free rates ranging between 1.5% and 3.1% for all outstanding LPP and LSP awards.\n\nFor the year ended 31 December 2021, the outstanding units were as follows:\n\nROE PSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n303 205\n\n297 030\n\n207 926\n\nGranted\n\n124 760\n\nForfeited\n\n-357\n\n-10 872\n\n-7 535\n\n-6 728\n\nVested\n\n-302 848\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n286 158\n\n200 391\n\n118 032\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n70.18\n\n78.22\n\n78.81\n\n74.20\n\nTSR PSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n245 696\n\n286 069\n\n340 493\n\nGranted\n\n225 148\n\nForfeited\n\n-290\n\n-10 473\n\n-12 340\n\n-12 141\n\nVested\n\n-245 406\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n275 596\n\n328 153\n\n213 007\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n86.62\n\n81.25\n\n48.12\n\n53.67\n\nENW PSU\n\nNon-vested at 1 January\n\n192 523\n\nGranted\n\n121 144\n\nForfeited\n\n-6 978\n\n-6 533\n\nVested\n\nOutstanding as of 31 December\n\n185 545\n\n114 611\n\nGrant date fair value in CHF\n\n85.17\n\n74.20\n\n| SU                               |         |\n|----------------------------------|---------|\n| Non-vested at 1 January  Granted | 316 789 |\n| Forfeited                        | -9 010  |\n| Vested                           |         |\n| Outstanding as of 31 December    | 307 779 |\n| Grant date fair value in CHF     | 93.50   |\n\nLPP 2018\n\nLPP 2019\n\nLPP 2020\n\nLSP 2021",

        "page_content": "## 22 Variable interest entities\n\nThe Group enters into arrangements with variable interest entities (VIEs) in the normal course of business. The involvement ranges from being a passive investor to designing, structuring and managing the VIEs. The variable interests held by the Group arise primarily as a res ult of the Group's involvement in certain insurance-linked securitisations, life and health funding transactions, swaps in trusts, debt financing, investment, senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans as well as other entities, which meet the definition of a VIE .\n\nWhen analysing whether the entity is a VIE, the Group mainly assesses if (1) the equity is sufficient to finance the entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) the equity holders have the right to make significant decisions affecting the entity's operations and (3) the holders of the voting rights substantively participate in the gains and losses of the entity.\n\nWhen one of these criteria is not met, the entity is considered a VIE and is assessed for consolidation under the VIE section  of the Consolidation Topic.\n\nThe party that has a controlling financial interest is called a primary beneficiary and consolidates the VIE. The party is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it has both:\n\n- the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance; and\n- the obligation to absorb the entity's losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\n\nFor all its variable interests in VIEs, the Group assesses whether it has a controlling fin ancial interest in these entities and, thus, is the primary beneficiary. The Group identifies the activities that most significantly impact the entity's performance and determines whether the Group has the power to direct those activities. In conducting the analysis, the Group considers the purpose, the design and the risks that the entity was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders. Additionally, the Group assesses if it has the obligati on to absorb losses or if it has the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. If both criteria are met, the Group has a controlling financial interest in the VIE and consolidates the entity.\n\nThe Group monitors changes to the facts and circumstances of the existing involvement with legal entities to determine whether they require reconsideration of the entity's designation as a VIE or voting interest entity. For VIEs, the Group regularly reassesses the primary beneficiary determination.\n\n## Insurance-linked securitisations\n\nThe insurance-linked securitisations transfer pre-existing insurance risk to investors through the issuance of insurance-linked securities. In insurance-linked securitisations, the securitisation vehicle assumes the insurance risk from  a sponsor through insurance or derivative contracts. The securitisation vehicle generally retains the issuance proceeds as collateral, which consists of investment-grade securities. The Group does not have potentially significant variable interest in these vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary.\n\nTypically, the variable interests held by the Group arise through ownership of insurance-linked securities, in which case the Group's maximum loss equals the principal amount of the securities held by the Group.\n\n## Life and health funding vehicles\n\nThe Group participates in certain structured transactions that retrocede longevity and mortality risks to captive reinsurers with an aim to provide regulatory capital credit to a transaction sponsor through the creation of funding notes by a separate funding vehicle which is generally considered a VIE. The Group's participation in these transactions is generally limited to providing contingent fund ing support via a financial contract with a funding vehicle, which represents a potentially significant variable interest in the funding vehicle. The Group does not have power to direct activities of the funding vehicles and therefore is not a primary beneficiary of the funding vehicle s in these transactions. The Group's maximum exposure in these transactions equals either the total contract notional or outstanding balance of the funding notes issued by the vehicle, depending on the specific contractual arrangements.\n\n## Swaps in trusts\n\nThe Group provides interest rate and foreign exchange risk hedges to certain asset securitisation trusts which qualify as VIEs. As the Group's involvement is limited to interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives, it does not have the  power to direct any activities of the trusts and therefore does not qualify as primary beneficiary of any of these trusts. These activities are in run -off.\n\n## Debt financing vehicles\n\nThe Group consolidates a debt-financing vehicle created to collateralise reinsurance coverage provided by the Group. The Group mana ges the asset portfolio in the vehicle and absorbs the variability of the investment return of the vehicle's portfolio, thereby satisfying both criteria for a controlling financial interest: power over activities most significant to the vehicle's economic performance and significant economic interest.",

        "page_content": "## Investment vehicles\n\nThe Group's variable interests in investment partnerships arise through ownership of the limited partner interests. Many investment partnerships are VIEs because the limited partners as a group lack kick-out or participating rights. The Group does not hold the general partner interest in the limited partnerships and therefore does not direct investment activities of the entity. Therefore, the Group lacks power over the relevant activities of the vehicles and, consequently, does not qualify as the primary beneficiary. The Group is exposed to losses when the values of the investments held by the investment vehicles decrease. The Group's maximum exposure to loss equals the Group's share of the investment.\n\nThe Group is a passive investor in structured securitisation vehicles issuing residential and commercial mortgage -backed securities (RMBS and CMBS, respectively) and other asset-backed securities (ABS). The Group's investments in RMBS, CMBS and other ABS are passive in nature and do not obligate the Group to provide any financial or other support to the issuer entities. By design, RMBS, CMBS and ABS securitisation entities are not adequately capitalised and therefore considered VIEs. The Group is not the primary beneficiary, because it does not have power to direct most significant activities. These investments are accounted for as available-for-sale as described in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\nThe Group consolidates an investment vehicle, because the Group holds the entire interest in the entity and makes investment decisions related to the entity. The investment vehicle is a VIE because it is structured as an umbrella company comprised of multiple sub -funds. The majority of the investments held in this vehicle are accounted for as available-for-sale and are disclosed in the investment note and not included in the tables on the following pages.\n\n## Investment vehicles for unit-linked business\n\nAdditionally, the Group invests on behalf of the policyholders as a passive investor in a variety of investment funds across various jurisdictions. By design, many of these funds meet a VIE definition. While the Group may have a potentially significant var iable interest in some of these entities due to its share of the fund's total net assets, in most cases it does not have power over the fund's  investment decisions or unilateral kick-out rights relative to the decision maker.\n\nThe Group is not exposed to losses in the aforementioned investment vehicles, as the investment risk is borne by the policyholder.\n\n## Senior commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans\n\nThe Group also invests in structured commercial mortgage and infrastructure loans, which are held for i nvestment.\n\nThe commercial mortgage loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with commercial real estate. The entities are adequately capitalised and generally structured as voting interest entities. Occasionally, the borrower  entities can be structured as limited partnerships where the limited partners do not have kick-out or participating rights, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe infrastructure loans are made to non-recourse special purpose entities collateralised with infrastructure project assets. Some borrower entities may have insufficient equity investment at risk, which results in the VIE designation.\n\nThe Group does not have power over the activities most significant to the aforementioned borrower entities designated as VIEs and therefore does not consolidate them.\n\nThe Group's maximum exposure to loss from its investments equals the loan outstanding amount.\n\n## Other\n\nThe Group consolidates a vehicle providing reinsurance to its members, because it serves as a decision maker over the entity's investment and underwriting activities, as well as provides retrocession for the majority of the vehicle's insurance risk and receives p erformance-based fees. Additionally, the Group is obligated to provide the vehicle with loans in case of a deficit. The vehicle is a VIE, primarily because its total equity investment at risk is insufficient and the members lack decision -making rights.\n\nThe Group did not provide financial or other support to any VIEs during 2021 that it was not previo usly contractually required to provide.",

Level 3 investments are included in the fixed income securities, other invested assets, and accrued expenses and other liabilities line items on the consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLevel 3 investments, including fixed income securities (private placements and infrastructure loans), derivatives, and other invested assets, trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. The Group's estimation of fair value relies on unobservable assumptions, such as liquidity or credit considerations. The determination of these unobservable assumptions requires subjectivity and judgment as these assumptions are generally not based on market activity.  Unobservable assumptions, such as liquidity or credit considerations, among others, are based on internal estimates.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not absolute assurance and therefore is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with GAAS, Swiss Law, and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Misstatements are considered material if there is a substantial likelihood that, individually or in the aggregate, they would influence the judgment made by a reasonable user based\n\non the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn performing an audit in accordance with GAAS, Swiss Law, and Swiss Auditing Standards, we:\n\n- \uf8e7 Exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.\n- \uf8e7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, and design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.\n- \uf8e7 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.\n\n\u00a9 2022 KPMG AG, a Swiss corporation, is a subsidiary of KPMG Holding AG, which is a member of the KPMG global organization of independent firms affiliated with KPMG International Limited, a private English company limited by guarantee.

If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report.

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, with the exception of the consolidated financial statements, the stand-alone financial statements of the company, the compensation report and our auditor's report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information, and we do not express an opinion or any form of assurance thereon.\n\nIn connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and consider whether a material inconsistency exists between the other information and the financial statements, or the other information otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work performed, we conclude that an uncorrected material misstatement of the other information exists, we are required to describe it in our report.

        "page_content": "## Annual Report Swiss Re Ltd\n\nSwiss Re Ltd (the Company), domiciled in Zurich, Switzerland, is the ultimate holding company of the Swiss Re Group (the Group). Its principal activity is the holding of investments in Swiss Re Group companies.\n\n## Income statement\n\nNet income for 2021 amounted to CHF 610 million (2020: CHF 1 573 million).\n\nRevenues were mainly driven by cash dividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies of CHF 868  million, trademark licence fees of CHF 407 million, realised gains on derivative financial instruments of CHF 82 million, interest on loans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies of CHF 51 million, and commitment fees of CHF 65 million.\n\nExpenses were mainly driven by a valuation adjustment to the carrying amount of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies of CHF 328 million, administrative expenses of CHF 256 million, realised loss on investments of CHF 92 million, commitment fees of CHF 84 million, and interest on loans of CHF 23 million.\n\n## Assets\n\nTotal assets decreased from CHF 25 104 million as of 31 December 2020 to CHF 23 207 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nCurrent assets decreased by CHF 1 091 million to CHF 3 622 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly driven by a decrease in receivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\nNon-current assets decreased by CHF 806 million to CHF 19 585 million as of 31 December 2021, driven by a decrease in investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies and loans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\n## Liabilities\n\nTotal liabilities decreased from CHF 2 619 million as of 31 December 2020 to CHF 1 817 million as of 31 December 2021.\n\nShort-term liabilities increased by CHF 12 million to CHF 514 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly driven by an increase in loans from subsidiaries and affiliated companies partially offset by a decrease in payables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\nLong-term liabilities decreased by CHF 814 million to CHF 1 303 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly due to a loan agreement with Swiss Re Finance (UK) plc partially offset by an increase in provision for currency fluctuation.\n\n## Shareholders' equity\n\nShareholders' equity decreased from CHF 22 485 million as of 31 December 2020 to CHF 21 390 million as of 31 December 2021, mainly due to dividends to shareholders of CHF 1 705 partially offset by net income of CHF 610 million.\n\n## Coronavirus\n\nThe global spread of the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes ('COVID-19'), and the actions taken to slow the spread of the pandemic, have had an adverse impact on communities, social and business interactions, economic activity and economies across the globe. Following the significant contractions of 2020, economic growth momentum is expected to carry over into 2022. However, the expectation of post-crisis global growth and the recovery remains fragile and uneven across economies, which are less resilient to face any subsequent shocks and/or challenges. As the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ultimate toll of the pandemic in terms of lives lost, societal dislocations, business activity, economic growth, broader costs to society and industry losses remains highly uncertain. The Swiss Re Group will continue to monitor pandemic-related developments and their impact on its operations and its investments.",

Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n\n## Foreign currency translation\n\nAssets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs at year-end exchange rates, with the exception of participations, which are reported in Swiss francs at historical exchange rates. Income and expenses in foreign currencies are converted into Swiss francs using the exchange rate prevailing at the date of transaction.\n\n## Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents include cash at bank, short-term deposits and certain investments in money market funds with an original maturity of three months or less. Such current assets are held at nominal value.\n\n## Short-term investments\n\nShort-term investments contain investments with an original maturity between three months and one year. Such investments are carried at cost, less necessary and legally permissible depreciation.\n\n## Receivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other receivables\n\nThese assets are generally carried at nominal value. Value adjustments are recorded where the expected recovery value is lower than the nominal value.\n\nReceivables from subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other receivables also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.\n\n## Accrued income\n\nAccrued income consists of both other expenditures incurred during the financial year but relating to a subsequent financial year, and revenues relating to the current financial year but receivable in a subsequent financial year.\n\n## Loans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nLoans to subsidiaries and affiliated companies are carried at nominal value. Value adjustments are recorded where the expected recovery value is lower than the nominal value.\n\n## Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nThese assets are carried at cost less necessary value adjustments to reflect other than temporary decreases in the value in use.\n\nIn 2021, the Group streamlined its legal entity structure. The direct subsidiaries Swiss Re Corporate Solutions Ltd and Swiss Re Life Capital Ltd transferred the rights and obligations of all assets and liabilities to the direct subsidiary Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd in the form of a merger with an accounting effective 1 January 2021. As a result, the Company increased the carrying amount of the investment in Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd by the carrying amounts of the investments in Swiss Re Corporate Solutions Ltd and Swiss Re Life Capital Ltd. The merger had no impact on the Company's total assets, total liabilities or total shareholders' equity. Further details are provided in Note 6 'Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies'.\n\n## Payables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other liabilities\n\nThese liabilities are generally carried at nominal value.\n\nPayables to subsidiaries and affiliated companies/ Other liabilities also include derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments which have an observable market price and are traded in an active and liquid market are recorded at market value. Derivative financial instruments are traded with subsidiaries and affiliated companies.",

These net impacts are recognised in the income statement over a period of up to three years. Where the provision for currency fluctuation is insufficient to absorb net foreign exchange losses for the financial year, the provision for currency fluctuation is reduced to zero and the excess foreign exchange loss is recognised in the income statement.\n\nThe provision for taxation represents an estimate of taxes payable in respect of the reporting year.\n\n## Debt\n\nDebt is held at redemption value.\n\n## Other legal capital reserves\n\nOther legal capital reserves reflect gains and losses from sale of own shares (directly held by the Company).\n\n## Reserve for own shares (indirectly held by subsidiaries)\n\nReserve for own shares is accounted for at the book value of those shares in the statutory financial statements of the respective subsidiary.\n\n## Own shares (directly held by the Company)\n\nOwn shares are carried at cost and presented as a deduction in shareholders' equity.\n\n## Foreign exchange transaction gains and losses\n\nForeign exchange gains and losses arising from foreign exchange transactions are recognised in the income statement and reported in other revenues or other expenses, respectively.\n\n## Dividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised as investment income in the year in which they are declared.\n\n## Trademark licence fees\n\nTrademark licence fees are charged by the Company to its direct and indirect subsidiaries and their branches that benefit from the use of the Swiss Re brand.\n\n## Capital and indirect taxes\n\nCapital and indirect taxes related to the financial year are included in other expenses. Value-added taxes are included in the respective expense lines in the income statement.\n\n## Income tax expense\n\nSwiss Re Ltd is subject to ordinary income taxation at cantonal/ communal and federal level.\n\nDividends from subsidiaries and affiliated companies are indirectly exempt from income taxation (participation relief).\n\n## Subsequent events\n\nSubsequent events for the current reporting period have been evaluated up to 16 March 2022. This is the date on which the financial statements are available to be issued.",

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the entity in accordance with the provisions of Swiss law and the requirements of the Swiss audit profession and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\nReport on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight Authority\n\n## IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND AFFILIATED COMPANIES\n\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period.

Investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are recognised at acquisition cost or, in the case of expected permanent impairment, at the lower fair value. The investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies are not listed on an active market. The Company determines the fair value of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies using the internal established valuation method.\n\nAs part of our audit, we gained an understanding of the process related to the impairment assessment of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies. We performed a risk assessment to determine the amount of the headroom which would give us the scope of the investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies with a higher risk on recoverability. For these investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies we performed the following audit procedures:\n\nThe recoverability of investments in subsidiaries and affiliated companies is supported by an impairment\n\nZurich, 16 March 2022",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit.

        "page_content": "## Note on risk factors\n\nThe operations, investments and other activities of Swiss Re Ltd ('SRL') and its subsidiaries (collectively, the 'Group' or 'Swiss Re') are subject to a range of risks that could adversely impact the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\n\n## Military conflict in Ukraine\n\nThe military conflict unfolding in Ukraine, resulting trade and economic sanctions, and other potential impacts on the global economic environment and currencies, particularly in Russia and Europe, may cause demand for Swiss Re's products to be volatile, cause abrupt changes in its customers' buying patterns, interrupt its ability to supply products to this region or to fulfill contractual obligations or limit customers' access to financial resources and ability to satisfy obligations to Swiss Re. In the event geopolitical tensions fail to abate or deteriorate further, additional governmental sanctions may be enacted adversely impacting the global economy and supply chain, banking and monetary systems, markets or customers for Swiss Re's products, which could adversely affect Swiss Re's results of operations.\n\n## Coronavirus\n\nThe global spread of the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes ('COVID-19'), and the actions taken to slow the spread of the pandemic, have had an adverse impact on communities, social and business interactions, economic activity and economies across the globe. Following the impressive contractions of 2020, economic growth momentum is expected to carry over into 2022. However, the expectation of post-crisis global growth and the recovery remains fragile and uneven across economies. This remains especially true given the lower level of global economic resilience after the pandemic which renders economies much more vulnerable in the face of any subsequent shocks and/or challenges. The recovery of individual economies remains highly exposed to developments around the coronavirus, including: new strains of the virus which risk becoming vaccine-resistant or for which vaccines provide less protection against severe illness, drop in vaccine-acceptance rate (including for multiple doses) making herd immunity increasingly difficult to reach, and slow vaccination rollout in a number of emerging market economies. Despite the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, the global insurance markets (as measured by premium growth) were less severely impacted in 2021 than expected (although the life market was more adversely affected than the non-life market). Premium growth recovered in 2021 and is expected to continue to recover, alongside recovery of the global economy, in 2022 and 2023, supported by rate hardening. Growth is expected to be led by China and, to a lesser extent, by other markets in Asia, aided in the case of life business by greater awareness of the importance post-pandemic of mortality and health coverage, as well as digital insurance penetration.\n\nIn Property & Casualty, the COVID-19 crisis (in particular the impact on businesses and business activity) had the greatest impact on event cancellation, non-damage business interruption covers, and credit and surety (this was particularly true for 2020, whereas in 2021 Property & Casualty business was not materially impacted by COVID-19). In Life & Health Reinsurance, the COVID-19 crisis had the greatest impact on mortality exposures. The majority of losses in 2021 were incurred in the first, third and fourth quarters, largely driven by excess mortality, and reported losses to date continue to reflect high levels of incurred but not reported (IBNR) claims.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis prompted regulatory actions, including regulatory guidance in a number of US states in respect of temporary policyholder leniency, and legislative proposals in respect of policy exclusions and retroactive business interruption coverage. Legal challenges have been brought in a variety of jurisdictions, including, most notably, test cases brought in the United Kingdom by the Financial Conduct Authority, in respect of which the UK Supreme Court largely found on appeal, by the insurance company parties, in favour of holders of",

Legal actions on a range of pandemic-related claims are likely to continue in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis continues, and the ultimate toll of the pandemic in terms of lives lost, societal dislocations, business activity, economic growth, broader costs to society and industry losses remains highly uncertain. Many pandemic-related developments interact with long-term trends and outlooks, including the impact of persistent low yields on the insurance industry. It also remains to be seen how public-private partnership initiatives may evolve to address future pandemics.\n\n## General impact of adverse market conditions\n\nSwiss Re's operations as well as its investment returns are subject to conditions in the financial markets and macroeconomic factors, which are outside of its control. Financial, credit and foreign exchange markets are experiencing continued periods of volatility reflecting a range of political, geopolitical, economic and other uncertainties, some of the more significant of which are inter-related. Further adverse developments or the continuation of adverse trends that, in turn, have a negative impact on financial markets and economic conditions, could limit the Group's ability to access the capital markets and bank funding markets, could adversely affect the ability of counterparties to meet their obligations to the Group and could adversely affect the confidence of the ultimate buyers of insurance and reinsurance. Any of the foregoing factors, developments and trends could have an adverse effect on the Group's investment results, which in the current extremely low interest rate environment could have a material adverse effect on the Group's overall results, make it difficult to determine the value of certain assets in the Group's portfolio, make it more difficult to acquire suitable investments to meet its risk and return criteria and otherwise have a material adverse effect on its business and operations.\n\n## Regulatory changes\n\nSwiss Re and its subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment, which continues to change over time. The regulatory regimes to which members of the Group are subject have changed significantly in recent years and are expected to continue to evolve. While some regulation is national in scope, the global nature of the Group's business means that its operations are subject in effect to a patchwork of global, national and regional standards. Swiss Re and its subsidiaries are subject to group supervision and Swiss Re's subsidiaries are also subject to applicable regulation in each of the jurisdictions in which they conduct business, particularly Switzerland, the United States, the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Singapore. Swiss Re, as well as its Swiss-regulated entities, is subject to the Swiss Solvency Test and, through its legal entities and branches organised in the European Economic Area ('EEA'), Solvency II.\n\nWhile certain regulatory processes are designed in part to foster convergence and achieve recognition of group supervisory schemes, the Group continues to face risks of extra-territorial application of regulations, particularly as to group supervision and group solvency requirements. In addition, regulators in jurisdictions beyond those where the Group has core operations increasingly are playing a far greater oversight role, requiring more localised resources and, despite a predominantly local focus, also raise issues of a crossborder nature. Furthermore, evolving regulatory schemes and requirements may be inconsistent or may conflict with each other, thereby subjecting the Group, particularly in light of the increasing focus on legal entities in isolation, to higher compliance and legal costs, as well as the possibility of higher operational, capital and liquidity costs.",

        "page_content": "On the international level, certain large insurance companies were designated as global systemically important insurers ('G-SIIs') and reinsurance companies faced potential designation as G-SIIs. While further designations have been suspended until 2022, the determination to discontinue G-SII designations altogether will only be made in 2022, based on an assessment of progress made by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ('IAIS'), in establishing a new holistic framework for systemic risk that was adopted in November 2019 and implemented as of the beginning of 2020. The new framework embraces an enhanced set of policy measures targeted at the exposures and activities that can lead to systemic risks from the insurance sector as a whole. The Group cannot predict what additional regulatory changes will be implemented as the IAIS systemic risk process evolves and what any such changes may mean for how the Group is structured in any particular jurisdiction and how aspects of its business may be affected. Moreover, the Group cannot predict whether the Financial Stability Board will endorse the new IAIS holistic framework or retain the existing G-SII approach, or what regulatory changes may apply in the future to ceding companies in the context of broader designations of reinsurers as systemically important.\n\nIn addition, large internationally active insurance groups ('IAIGs'), which is a designation compiled by the IAIS as identified by group-wide supervisors, may become subject to a risk-based group-wide global insurance capital standard ('ICS'). ICS Version 2.0 was adopted in November 2019, and is expected to take effect in 2025, following a five-year confidential reporting period during which no supervisory action will be taken on the basis of the monitoring. In November 2019, the IAIS also adopted the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups ('ComFrame'), as well as some changes to a number of Insurance Core Principles ('ICPs') - guidance and standards on supervision of insurers and which apply to insurance companies regardless of size and international exposures. ComFrame strengthens ICP requirements for IAIGs and proposes that the group-wide supervisor, in consultation with the host supervisors, should exercise discretion in requiring IAIGs to submit recovery plans. Swiss Re has been classified as an IAIG.\n\nThe Group cannot predict which legislative and/or regulatory initiatives will be enacted or promulgated, what the scope and content of these initiatives ultimately will be, when they will be effective and what the implications will be for the industry, in general, and for the Group, in particular. The Group may be subject to changes in views of its regulators in respect of the models that the Group uses for capital and solvency purposes, and could be adversely affected if, for example, it is required to use standard models rather than internal models. Generally, legal and regulatory changes could have a material impact on the Group's business. Notwithstanding the departure of the United Kingdom from the EU single market and customs union, continued uncertainty regarding the ways in which the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union will evolve could also impact the legislative and/or regulatory regimes to which the Group is subject (including Solvency II), both in the United Kingdom and in the European Union.\n\nRegulatory changes also could occur in areas of broader application, such as competition policy and tax laws. For example, changes in tax laws, or the interpretation of the tax laws or tax regulations in jurisdictions in which the Group does business, or withdrawals of tax rulings in jurisdictions such as Switzerland that have issued such rulings to Swiss Re, could increase the taxes the Group pays, or impact the attractiveness of products offered by the Group, the Group's investment activities or the value of deferred tax assets. These changes, or inconsistencies between the various regimes that apply to the Group, could increase the costs of doing business (including due to increased capital requirements), reduce access to liquidity, limit the scope of current or future business or affect the competitive balance, or could make reinsurance less attractive to primary insurers.",

Swiss Re's Group Sustainability Strategy, of which climate change is an essential element, focuses on three key principles: embedding sustainability in a number of activities throughout the re/insurance value chain, leading sustainability-linked solutions and quantifying sustainability performance, including the impact Swiss Re has on society and the environment. In addition, Swiss Re addresses sustainability risks through its ESG Risk Framework which includes policies and guidelines that apply to a number of activities throughout the re/insurance value chain.\n\nWhile Swiss Re's sustainability strategy and practices, ESG Risk Framework and the level of transparency with which the company is approaching them are foundational to Swiss Re's business, they expose the company to several risks, including:\n\n- \u00b7 that Swiss Re may fail or be unable to fully achieve one or more of its sustainability goals due to a range of factors within or beyond its control, or that it may adjust or modify goals in light of new information, adjusted projections, or a change in business strategy, any of which could negatively impact Swiss Re's brand, reputation, and business;\n- \u00b7 that achieving its sustainability goals may require Swiss Re to expend significant resources, which could divert the attention of management and key personnel, affect profitability, harm Swiss Re competitively, or otherwise limit its ability to make investments into growth;\n- \u00b7 that disclosures related to ESG or sustainability may result in heightened scrutiny from shareholders, business partners or other third parties, including regulators and public authorities, of our ESG performance, activities, and decisions;\n- \u00b7 that a failure to or perception of a failure to disclose metrics and set goals that are rigorous enough or in an acceptable format, including in relation to how Swiss Re manages its claims and asset management, a failure to appropriately manage the selection of goals, a failure to or perception of a failure to make appropriate disclosures, perception of a failure to prioritise the 'correct' ESG goals, or an unfavourable ESG-related rating by a third party could negatively impact the Swiss Re brand, reputation, and business and subject the company to enforcement actions or climate litigation;\n- \u00b7 that the ESG or sustainability recommendations, standards, norms, metrics or regulatory requirements, which are constantly evolving, change in a manner that impacts the Group negatively or requires Swiss Re to change the content or manner of its disclosures, and its shareholders, business partners or third parties, including regulators and public authorities, view such change(s) negatively, Swiss Re is unable to adequately explain such changes, or is required to expend significant resources to update disclosures, any of which could negatively impact its brand, reputation, and business; and\n- \u00b7 that Swiss Re's brand, reputation, and business could be negatively impacted if any of its disclosures, reporting to third-party ESG standards, or reporting against its goals, are inaccurate or misleading, perceived to be inaccurate or misleading, or alleged to be inaccurate or misleading (including allegations of greenwashing).\n\nIf Swiss Re does not adapt to or comply with the evolving investor, shareholder, business partner or third party, including regulators and public authorities, expectations and ESG or sustainability recommendations, standards, norms, metrics or regulatory requirements or is perceived to have not responded appropriately to ESG or sustainability recommendations, standards, norms, metrics or regulatory requirements Swiss Re may suffer from reputational damage, which could result in its financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects being materially and adversely affected.",

        "page_content": "## Market risk\n\nVolatility and disruption in the global financial markets could expose the Group to significant financial and capital markets risk, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely impact the Group's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital position. The Group's exposure to interest rate risk is primarily related to the market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates. In general, low interest rates continue to pose significant challenges to the insurance and reinsurance industries, with earnings capacity under stress unless lower investment returns can be offset by lower combined ratios or higher returns from other asset classes. Exposure to credit spreads primarily relates to market price and cash flow variability associated with changes in credit spreads. When credit spreads widen, the net unrealised loss position of the Group's investment portfolio can increase, as could other-than-temporary impairments.\n\nThe Group is exposed to changes in the level and volatility of equity prices, as well as the value of securities or instruments that derive their value from a particular equity security, a basket of equity securities or a stock index. The Group is also subject to equity price risk to the extent that the values of life-related benefits under certain products and life contracts, most notably variable annuity contracts, are wholly or partially exposed, directly and/or indirectly, to market fluctuations, including equity prices. To the extent market values fall, the financial exposure on guarantees related to these contracts would increase to the extent this exposure is not hedged. While the Group has an extensive hedging programme covering its existing variable annuity business, certain risks cannot be hedged, including actuarial, basis and correlation risks. Exposure to foreign exchange risk arises from changes in spot prices, forward prices and volatilities of currency rates.\n\nThese risks can have a significant effect on investment returns and market values of securities positions, which in turn may affect both the Group's results of operations and financial condition. The Group continues to focus on asset-liability management for its investment portfolio, but pursuing even this strategy has its risks - including a possible mismatch between investments and liability benchmarks - that in turn can lead to reinvestment risk. The Group seeks to manage the risks inherent in its investment portfolio by repositioning the portfolio from time to time, as needed, and to reduce risk and fluctuations through the use of hedges and other risk management tools.\n\n## Credit risk\n\nIf the credit markets were to deteriorate, the Group could experience losses. Changes in the market value of the underlying securities and other factors impacting their price could give rise to market value losses. The Group could also face write-downs in other areas of its portfolio, including other structured instruments, and the Group and its counterparties could face difficulties in valuing credit-related instruments. Differences in opinion with respect to valuations of credit-related instruments could result in legal disputes among the Group and its counterparties as to their respective obligations, the outcomes of which are difficult to predict and could be material. The Group is also subject to credit and other risks in its credit business, including reliance on banks that underwrite and monitor facilities in which the Group participates and potential default by borrowers under those facilities.",

        "page_content": "## Liquidity risks\n\nThe Group's business requires, and its clients expect, that it has sufficient capital and sufficient liquidity to meet its re/insurance obligations, and that this would continue to be the case following the occurrence of any foreseeable event or series of events, including extreme catastrophes, that would trigger insurance or reinsurance coverage obligations. The Group's uses of funds include, among other things, payment of its obligations arising in its insurance and reinsurance businesses (including claims and other payments as well as insurance provision repayments due to portfolio transfers, securitisations and commutations), which may include large and unpredictable claims (including catastrophe claims), funding of capital requirements and operating costs, payment of principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and funding of acquisitions. The Group also has unfunded capital commitments in its private equity and hedge fund investments, which could result in funding obligations at a time when it is subject to liquidity constraints. In addition, the Group has potential collateral requirements in connection with a number of reinsurance arrangements, the amounts of which may be material and the meeting of which could require the Group to liquidate cash equivalents or other securities.\n\nThe Group manages liquidity and funding risks by focusing on the liquidity stress that is likely to result from extreme capital markets scenarios or from extreme loss events or combinations of the two. Generally, the ability to meet liquidity needs could be adversely impacted by factors that the Group cannot control, such as market dislocations or interruptions, adverse economic conditions, severe disruption in the financial and worldwide credit markets and the related increased constraints on the availability of credit; changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and credit spreads; or by perceptions among market participants of the extent of the Group's liquidity needs.\n\nUnexpected liquidity needs (including to meet collateral calls) could require the Group to increase levels of indebtedness or to liquidate investments or other assets. Should the Group require liquidity at a time when access to bank funding and the capital markets is limited, it may be unable to secure new sources of funding. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through asset sales may be constrained by market conditions and the related stress on valuations. In addition, the Group's ability to meet liquidity needs through the incurrence of debt may be limited by constraints on the general availability of credit in the case of bank funding, and adverse market conditions, in the case of capital markets debt. Failure to meet covenants in lending arrangements could further constrain access to liquidity. The Group's ability to meet liquidity needs may also be constrained by regulatory requirements that require regulated entities to maintain or increase regulatory capital, or that restrict intragroup transactions, the timing of dividend payments from subsidiaries or the fact that certain assets may be encumbered or are otherwise not tradeable. Finally, any adverse ratings action against the Group could trigger a need for further liquidity (for example, by triggering termination provisions or margin calls/collateral delivery requirements in contracts to which Swiss Re is a party) at a time when the Group's ability to obtain liquidity from external sources is limited by such ratings action.

        "page_content": "## Counterparty risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of defaults, or concerns about defaults, by its counterparties. Issuers or borrowers whose securities or loans the Group holds, trading counterparties, counterparties under swaps and other derivative contracts, clearing agents, clearing houses and other financial intermediaries may default on their obligations to the Group due to bankruptcy, insolvency, restructuring, regulatory intervention, lack of liquidity, adverse economic conditions, operations failure, fraud or other reasons, which could also have a material adverse effect on the Group. The Group has increased its allocation to higher return-generating strategies, including high-quality corporate debt and some alternative assets, which tend to also be subject to potentially greater counterparty risk than government bonds.\n\nThe Group could also be adversely affected by the insolvency of, or other credit constraints affecting, counterparties in its insurance and reinsurance operations. Moreover, the Group could be adversely affected by liquidity issues at ceding companies or at third parties to whom the Group has retroceded risk, and such risk could be exacerbated to the extent any such exposures are concentrated.\n\n## Risks relating to credit rating downgrades\n\nRatings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of reinsurance companies. Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the financial strength of reinsurers and insurers, such as Swiss Re. These ratings are intended to measure a company's ability to repay its obligations and are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies. Ratings may be solicited or unsolicited and may be downgraded or withdrawn at the sole discretion of the rating agencies.\n\nThe Group's ratings reflect the current opinion of the relevant rating agencies. One or more of the Group's ratings could be downgraded or withdrawn in the future. In addition, unsolicited ratings may also be downgraded or withdrawn, such as a downgrade in April 2020 of unsolicited insurer financial strength and long-term issuer default ratings assigned to various entities within the Group. Rating agencies may increase the frequency and scope of ratings reviews, revise their criteria or take other actions that may negatively impact the Group's ratings and/or the ratings of its legal entities, which it cannot predict. In addition, changes to the process or methodology of issuing ratings, or the occurrence of events or developments affecting the Group, could adversely affect the Group's existing ratings or make it more difficult for the Group to achieve improved ratings which it would otherwise have expected.\n\nAs claims paying and financial strength ratings are key factors in establishing the competitive position of reinsurers, a decline in Swiss Re's ratings and/or the ratings of its key rated legal entities could make reinsurance provided by the Group less attractive to clients relative to reinsurance from competitors with similar or stronger ratings. A decline in ratings could also cause the loss of clients who are required by policy or regulation to purchase reinsurance only from reinsurers with certain ratings. Certain larger reinsurance and derivative contracts may contain terms that would allow the ceding companies or counterparties to terminate the contract if the Group's ratings or those of its subsidiaries are downgraded beyond a certain threshold. Furthermore, ratings directly impact the availability and terms of unsecured financing (potentially impacting the Group's ability to rollover existing facilities or obtain new facilities) and declines in the Group's ratings or the ratings of legal entities within the Group could also obligate the Group to provide collateral or other guarantees in the course of its business or trigger early termination of funding arrangements, potentially resulting in a need for additional liquidity. As a ratings decline could also have a material adverse impact on the Group's costs of borrowing or ability to access the capital markets, the adverse implications of a downgrade could be more severe. These same factors could also impact the Group's insurance business.",

From time to time, the Group may institute, or be named as a defendant in, legal proceedings, and the Group may be a claimant or respondent in arbitration proceedings. These proceedings could involve coverage or other disputes with ceding companies, disputes with parties to which the Group transfers risk under reinsurance arrangements, disputes with other counterparties or other matters. The Group cannot predict the outcome of any of the foregoing, which could be material for the Group.\n\nThe Group could in the future be involved in investigations and regulatory proceedings, which could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines and other outcomes. These investigations and proceedings could relate to insurance or reinsurance matters, or could involve broader business conduct rules, including those in respect of market abuse, bribery, money laundering, trade sanctions, competition law and data protection and privacy. The Group also is subject to audits and challenges from time to time by tax authorities, which could result in increases in tax costs, changes to internal structures and interest and penalties. Tax authorities may also actively pursue additional taxes based on retroactive changes to tax laws. The Group could be subject to risks arising from alleged, or actual, violations of any of the foregoing, and could also be subject to litigation or enforcement actions arising from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with internal policies and procedures, negligence and malfeasance, such as undertaking or facilitating cyber-attacks on internal systems. Substantial legal liability could materially adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations or could cause significant reputational harm, which could seriously affect its business.\n\n## Risk of unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage, including social inflation\n\nAs industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may continue to emerge. Such issues have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Group's business by either requiring it to extend coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims against the Group. For example, the trend of social inflation has increased liability claims against the Group in recent years. There has been an increase in severity of awards and settlements affecting excess and umbrella layers, particular in the US, as well as an increase in commercial automotive and general liability claims. The Group has continued to pro-actively strengthen its reserves and has considered the latest information and outlook related to such claims, including in relation to economic and social inflation when making its reserve decisions. The Group believes that it has adequate reserves to address the uncertainty related to conditions such as social inflation. In addition, the Group closely monitors the intersection between social inflation, economic inflation and loss trend and adjusts its pricing accordingly. The Group continued to manage its exposure to large corporate risks due to ongoing volatility related to social inflation in 2021 and materially reduced its exposure. Despite the Group's various measures to address these issues, there remains uncertainty on how these unintended issues related to claims and coverage may impact the Group's business. If the Group's reserving and pricing is not adequate to cover these issues, there could be an additional adverse effect for the Group's business, financial condition or results of operations.",

Any of the foregoing, as well as the occurrence of future risks that the Group's risk management procedures fail to identify or anticipate, could have a material adverse effect on the Group, and could also give rise to reputational risk.\n\n## Use of models; accounting matters\n\nThe Group is subject to risks relating to the preparation of estimates and assumptions that its management uses, for example, as part of its risk models as well as those that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in the Group's financial statements (such as assumptions related to the Group's capital requirements and anticipated liabilities), including assumed and ceded business. For example, the Group estimates premiums pending receipt of actual data from ceding companies, which actual data could deviate from the estimates (and could be adversely affected if premiums turn out to be lower, while claims stay the same). In addition, particularly with respect to large natural catastrophes and pandemics, it may be difficult to estimate losses, and preliminary estimates may be subject to a high degree of uncertainty and change as new information becomes available. Deterioration in market conditions could have an adverse impact on assumptions used for financial reporting purposes, which could affect possible impairment of present value of future profits, fair value of assets and liabilities, deferred acquisition costs or goodwill. Moreover, regulators could require the use of standard models instead of permitting the use of internal models. To the extent that management's estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, it could have a material impact on underwriting results (in the case of risk models) or on reported financial condition or results of operations (in the case of accounting judgments), and such impact could be material.",

Financial information included in the EVM report contains non-GAAP financial measures. The EVM principles differ significantly from US GAAP and, accordingly, the Group's results prepared in accordance with US GAAP will differ from its EVM results, and those differences could be material. The Group's annual EVM results can be more volatile than the US GAAP results because, among others, assets and liabilities are measured on a market consistent basis, profit recognition on new contracts is recognised at inception rather than over the lifetime of the contract, and life and health actuarial assumptions are on a best estimate basis as opposed to generally being locked-in.
