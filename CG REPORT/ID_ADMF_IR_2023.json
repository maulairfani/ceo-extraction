In 2023, the number of outstanding shares was recorded at 1,000,000,000, with the lowest share price range of IDR8,700 per share and the highest at IDR12,400 per share.\n\nIn 2023, the average transaction volume was recorded at 2.4 million share transactions per month. The number of transactions is relatively low when compared to other companies' shares.

In our evaluation, the successful execution of key strategies, prudent risk management, and good corporate governance were  critical  to  the  Company's  achievements,  as  discussed further in this report.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN 2023\n\nThe global macro economy faced various challenges in 2023. The Russia-Ukraine conflict, surging inflation, and aggressive rate  hikes  by  the  United  States  Federal  Reserve  and  other major  central banks  weighed  down  the  post-pandemic recovery process.\n\nThe  Fed  raised  its  benchmark  interest  rate  four  times  to 5.25%-5.50%  during  2023.  As  a  result,  this  put  pressure  on emerging  markets  including  Indonesia,  and  also  drove  up the cost of funds globally. In Indonesia, proactive measures by Bank Indonesia, including a benchmark rate increase to 6%,  successfully  maintained  the  financial  stability  of  the Indonesian system.\n\nIndonesia's  economic  growth  of  5.05%  also  exceeded  the average global growth of 3.0% according to the International Monetary Fund, in line with the recovering domestic demand  which was able to boost growth. Economic activity and  mobility  normalized  further,  which  helped  bolster  the economy and increase consumer purchasing power, as did rising Foreign Direct Investment (FDI).\n\nAdira Finance's post-pandemic recovery continued to accelerate in 2023. Leveraging synergy and collaboration with Bank Danamon as the parent company and the MUFG ecosystem, the management to record sound asset and profitability growth in 2023. Customer trust and satisfaction were key external factors behind the achievement the Company's growth.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n37",

In addition, Indonesia successfully maintained a sizeable trade surplus, which helped strengthen the currency. As of December 31, 2023, the Rupiah closed at Rp15,416 against the US Dollar vs. the previous year's close of Rp15,731.\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS\n\nIn  line  with  the  improving  economic  climate  in Indonesia, based  on Association of Indonesia Motorcycle  Industry  data,  industry  sales  of  new motorcycles  recorded  growth  of  19.4%  (yoy)  to 6.2  million  units  in  2023.  Meanwhile,  based  on data  from  the  Indonesian  Automotive  Industry Association  (Gaikindo),  the  sales  of  new  cars  in the industry was still experiencing a year-on-year decline of 4.1% (yoy) to 1.0 million units. However, the opportunity to expand car sales in the future is considerable, considering the still low penetration of cars.\n\nIn the view of the Board  of Commissioners, the  Board  of  Directors  performed  well  in  2023, successfully overcoming multiple challenges to lead Adira Finance  to record sound  asset and profitability growth. Customer trust and satisfaction with Adira Finance were key external factors behind the achievement of above industryaverage growth.\n\nThe  management  also  successfully  carried  out its  strategic  objectives  of  enhancing  automotive and  non-automotive  growth.  In  addition,  Adira Finance  has  also  taken  initiatives  to  enhance customer retention by introducing a range of more comprehensive  products  through  collaboration with  the  MUFG  ecosystem.  At  the  same  time, the  Company  maintained  the  sustainability  and stability of its business through  prudent  risk management to consistently maintain asset quality  and  liquidity.  On  the  sustainable  finance and  Environment,  Social  and  Governance  (ESG) front, the Company also made measurable progress.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nGrowth was driven by both organic and inorganic means. Organically, we continued to innovate and launch new customer and dealer marketing and loyalty programs, which were able to meaningfully increase direct customer acquisition and retention for both automotive and non-automotive financing. This was supported by diversified offerings,  as  well  as  collaboration  and  synergies with  Bank  Danamon  and  MUFG  Group.  Adira Finance also participated in various high-visibility national  events  to  strengthen  brand  awareness and  attract  new  customers.  The  expansion  into non-automotive products including multipurpose loans and durables continued, successfully growing by 29.1% (yoy) to IDR8.0 trillion in 2023.\n\nAs such, Adira Finance successfully recorded new financing growth of 31.2% (yoy) to IDR41.6 trillion, on the back of strong growth in both automotive and  non-automotive.  In  automotive  financing, Adira  Finance  regained  market  share  with  new motorcycles  sales  reaching  602  thousand  units and  new  car  unit  sales  reaching  50  thousand units,  translating  to  9.7%  and  5.0%  market  share respectively. In the non-automotive segment, the Company  successfully  expanded  its  offerings  in the form of multipurpose loans and durables.\n\nIn addition, new sharia-based financing increased by  33.8%  to  IDR8.9  trillion  in  2023,  showing  that the  Company's  strategy  to  promote  and  market sharia products through sharia business channel networks and channel sales in the shariah community has been successful.\n\nInorganic  growth  was  pursued  as    part  of  the strategy  to  further  develop  the  Company's  nonautomotive  business  and  accelerate  scale-up  of the business. To this end, Adira Finance completed the  acquisition  of  9.83%  share  ownership  of  PT Home Credit Indonesia (HCI) in the third quarter of 2023 together with Krungsri Bank (as the majority shareholder).

This transaction  is  expected  to  enhance  and  expand financial  services  in  Indonesia  through  synergy and collaboration among the MUFG ecosystem.\n\nDigitalization of the Adira Finance  ecosystem continued to advance, with optimalization of sales through digital applications and platforms such as Adiraku, Momobil.id, Momotor.id, Moservice.id and dicicilaja.com. Each of these digital platforms has been continually enhanced for improved customer experience  and  satisfaction.  In  combination,  the goal  of  having  these  diverse  digital  channels  is to create a comprehensive  digital ecosystem together  with  Adira  Finance's  physical  branches that is able to increase engagement and retention by  meeting  consumers'  financing  and  vehicle needs at every stage.\n\nIn terms of ESG, the Company has partnered with 35  electric  vehicles  (EV)  producers,  supporting Indonesia's transition to clean energy. Furthermore, the Company had also  signed a deal with MUFG and  Bank  Danamon  for  social  loans  facilities intended  to  advance  microfinancing  to  MSME entrepreneurs in untapped segments for vehicle purchases, multipurpose loans and durable goods essential to their business operations.\n\nGrowth  was  accompanied  by  sustained  healthy asset quality, which was driven by the steps taken by  the  Board  of  Directors.  The  Non  Performing Finance (NPF) ratio was manageable at 1.9% in 2023. The  management  also  successfully  maintained appropriate  liquidity  levels  throughout  the  year, supported by the management's efforts to actively secured diversified funding sources, through good joint  financing  support  from  Bank  Danamon  as the  parent  company, as well as external funding from  both  bank  loans  as  well  as  bond  issuance. Furthermore, the Company's strong domestic and international  credit  ratings,  which  reflect  strong shareholders  support  and  business  synergy  with\n\nBank Danamon and MUFG group as well as Adira Finance's financial and  business  performance, have positively impacted investor confidence in Adira  Finance.  Subsequently,  Adira  Finance successfully    had  two  bonds  issuance  in  2023 which  were  oversubscribed.  This  indicates  that Adira Finance continues to be a trusted name in the investor market, as reflected by its strong and stable  credit  ratings  issued  by  Pefindo,  Moody's, and Fitch.\n\nAs a result, Adira Finance successfully ended the year  with  a  net  profit  increase  of  21.1%  (yoy)  to IDR1.9 trillion in 2023, and was well positioned for future growth\n\n## SUPERVISION OF CORPORATE STRATEGY\n\nThe  Board  of  Commissioners  has  consistently monitored,  supervised  and  advised  the  Board of  Directors with regard to the achievement and realization of Adira Finance's strategy and targets. Regular  meetings,  supplemented  by  additional meetings and discussions as necessary, were held to  review  the  formulation  and  execution  of  the Company's  strategies  and  policies.  Throughout 2023, the Board of Commissioners held 7 internal meetings, as well as 6 joint meetings with Directors.\n\nThroughout  2023,  the  Board  of  Commissioners supervised  the  preparation  and  implementation of  the  Company's strategy and policies, included strengthening  and  regaining  market  share  in the  automotive  business;  diversifying  into  nonautomotive products; strengthening customer retention;  accelerating  the  digitalization  process within the organization and the ecosystem; and  maintaining  adequate  liquidity  to  fund  the Company's business needs and all of its financial obligations.\n\nThe Board of Commissioners also supervised the continued  implementation  of  Good  Corporate Governance  (GCG)  including  risk  management, and the progress of the Company's sustainability strategy  as  been  set  forth  in  Adira  Finance's\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n39",

In addition, the  Indonesian  economy  remains  vulnerable  to global  trade  disruptions,  price  fluctuations  in  its key commodity exports of coal and crude palm oil, and further policy tightening among others.\n\nAs  such,  the  Ministry  of  Finance  predicts  that growth for the Indonesian economy will continue to be stable at around 5.2%, supported by robust household spending and by increased government spending. Inflation is also expected to stay under control.  Thus,  Gaikindo  projects  relatively  stable new  car  sales  growth  of  1.1  million  units,  while AISI  projects  sales  of  new  motorcycles  reaching 6.2-6.5  million  units,  and  APPI  projects  financing receivables growth from multifinance companies of 12-13% in 2024.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nIn our view, the fundamental improvements achieved  by  Adira  Finance  in  2023,  which  are reflected by its asset and profitability growth, will support  continued  growth  for  the  Company  in 2024. Product and channel diversification will be further  backed  by  strengthening  collaboration with Bank Danamon and other MUFG ecosystems, including Home  Credit Indonesia. Meanwhile, the Mandala Finance acquisition is expected to  close  sometime  in  2024,  which  will  further strengthen the Company's reach. Together, these  developments  will  expand  Adira  Finance's ecosystem and enable it  to  offer  a  more  diverse set of solutions for its customers which in turn will increase loyalty and retention.\n\nIn terms of cost structure, the Company also goes into 2024 with efficiencies achieved through digitalization and HR reorganization, plus increased productivity from product diversification and cross-sell.  Adequate  liquidity  and  diversification of funding sources continued to be well-balanced, as reflected by Adira Finance's strong and stable ratings.\n\nAs Adira Finance continues to explore new opportunities  such  as  electric  vehicle  (EV)  and MSME financing, we are therefore confident that the Company has considerable room for growth.\n\nIn summary, the Board of Commissioners believes that  the  Board  of  Directors  has  taken  the  right steps to position the Company for the challenges ahead by prudently safeguarding the Company's risk exposure  and  expanding  its  markets  and offerings, supported by digitalization and rigorous compliance practices.",

This  was supported  by  comprehensive  risk  management and  internal  control  systems,  as  well  as  good management by the Board of Directors with the support of the Board of Commissioners and Sharia Supervisory Board.\n\nTo  ensure  the  adequacy  of  risk  identification, measurement, control, and monitoring processes, Adira Finance follows the risk management practices of Bank Danamon as the parent company. In addition, Adira Finance has also  implemented the Anti Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/TF) policies, as well as risk management and governance policies related to the usage and role of  information  technology  (IT)  in  consideration of  the  Company's  digital  transformation  and  the growing role of IT in the organization's operations.\n\nAs  such,  the  Company's  self-assessment  of  GCG, which  was  based  on  the  Financial  Health  Level of  Financing  Companies  following  the  direction of the Financial Services Authority (Otoritas Jasa  Keuangan  or  OJK),  resulted  in  a  #1  rating, indicating  exceptional  GCG  implementation.  In addition, Adira Finance's AMT-CML program once again  received  a  'Good'  score,  providing  further confirmation  of  the  quality  of  the  Company's GCG practices.  The  Company's  ASEAN  Corporate Governance Scorecard from the Indonesian Institute for Corporate Directorship (IICD), an independent  third  party,  moreover  categorized Adira's  GCG  practices  as  'Very  Good',  with  an overall  weighted  score  of  98.20  compared  with the  previous  year's  score  of  94.58.

The implementation of the WBS is directly supervised by the Board of Commissioners  with  the  assistance  of  the  Audit Committee,  and  the  Board  of  Commissioners provides advice to the Board of Directors as needed on improving the quality of WBS implementation. In  2023,  a  number  of  reports  and  cases  were communicated  through  the  WBS,  which  were followed  up  in  accordance  with  the  applicable rules and regulations.\n\n## ASSESSMENT OF THE COMMITTEES UNDER THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS\n\nIn executing  its  supervisory  duties,  the  Board of Commissioners  is  assisted  by  a  number  of Committees,  namely  the  Audit  Committee,  the Nomination  and  Remuneration  Committee,  the Risk Monitoring Committee, and the Governance Committee.\n\nIn 2023, all of these Committees performed their duties and responsibilities satisfactorily and played an important role in supporting the Board  of  Commissioners  to  carry  out  its supervisory function. This assessment is based on various  criteria,  which  include  the  frequency  of meetings, meeting conduct, the level of meeting attendance,  the  competence  of  the  members, performance achievements and the quality of the recommendations.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n41",

This committee  also  ensured that  the  GCG  principles  have  been  adequately implemented in the Company's day-to-day operations and activities.\n\n## SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\nAdira Finance takes its social and environmental responsibilities  seriously.  Throughout  2023,  the Company  continued  to  create  additional  value and  benefits  for  stakeholders  through  various corporate social responsibility and environmental programs,  in  alignment  with  its  commitment  to Creating Shared Value (CSV).\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nIn  doing  so,  the  Company  strives  to  empower communities  and  consumers  in  a  sustainable manner that will deliver long-term benefits for all concerned.

The  Company  has  carried  out  various  initiatives  to  unlock opportunities,  and  strengthen  synergies  and  collaboration with Bank Danamon as the Parent Company as well as with MUFG's ecosystem. These initiatives bolstered Adira Finance to increase asset growth and record positive performance in 2023, as discussed in this report.\n\n## MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY ANALYSIS\n\n## Global and Domestic Economic Landscape\n\nGlobal economic conditions were still shrouded by uncertainty at  the  end  of  2023,  primarily  due  to  monetary  tightening by  developed  countries  to  manage  inflation.  Additionally, geopolitical conditions still posed risks to economic growth prospects.\n\nDeveloped countries such as the United States continued to face above target  with inflation, high interest rates, and rising fiscal  pressures  which  shadowed  the  weakening  economy. Meanwhile,  other  developed  countries  such  as  China  still faced  the  challenge  of  post-COVID-19  economic  weakness due to softening domestic demand.\n\nMeanwhile,  Indonesia's  economic  growth  remained  strong amidst  uncertain  global  economic  conditions.  Throughout 2023, Indonesia's economy grew by  5.05%. Economic growth remained strong, supported by solid domestic demand and continued  recovery  in  the  tourism  sector.  However,  export performance in 2023 decreased by 11.33% to USD258.2 billion due  to  weakening  global  demand  and  falling  commodity prices.\n\nCorporate\n\nGovernance\n\nEnvironmental\n\nand Social\n\nResponsibility\n\nSupporting\n\nData\n\nIn recent years, Adira Finance has implemented a strategy to continuously strengthen its automotive and nonautomotive businesses. In 2023 the Company's performance demonstrated its recovery with recorded financing receivables of IDR55.7 trillion. This financing receivables has surpassed preCOVID-19 pandemic amounts. Adira Finance's asset and profitability growth is the result of implementing initiative strategies as well as synergy and collaboration with Bank Danamon as the parent company and also with the MUFG ecosystem.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n47",

        "page_content": "48\n\nFurthermore,  in  line  with  the  increase  in  the United States federal funds rate and in response to  increasing  global  uncertainty,  Bank  Indonesia raised  the  benchmark  interest  rate  a  couple  of times  to  6%  from  5.5%  in  2022.  Consumer  Price Index (CPI) inflation in 2023 was 2.61% (yoy), lower than inflation in 2022 which was recorded at 5.51% (yoy).\n\n## Multifinance   Industry and Automotive Market\n\nAdira  Finance's  growth  is  closely  related  to  the development of the Indonesian financing industry and automotive market. From the industrial side,  the    semiconductor supply limitations were resolved  in  2023.  The  positive  trend  was    also supported by improved export demand  and economic activity outside Java. These phenomena drove motorcycle sales during the year to exceed projections.  Based  on  data  from  the  Indonesian Motorcycle Industry Association (AISI), motorcycle sales  reached  6.2  million  units,  growing  by  19.4% compared to the previous year.\n\nMeanwhile,  based  on  data  from  the  Association of  Indonesian  Automotive  Industries  (Gaikindo), car  sales  throughout  2023  reached  1.0  million units, a slight decrease  of  4.1%  compared  to 2022. This decrease resulted from a slowdown in the  automotive  market  in  the  second  semester, stemming  from increased interest rates and slowing economic growth. However, the potential to increase car sales is still very high in the future, considering that car penetration is still low.\n\nThe financing industry experienced positive growth, as reflected by  the increase in  receivables. Based on data from the Financial Services Authority (OJK),  total  financing  receivables,  including  joint financing,  grew  by  15%  (yoy)  to  IDR659.9  trillion. Meanwhile, the Non-Performing Financing (NPF) ratio in December  2023  amounting  to  2.44%, slightly  higher  than  in  December  2022.  These conditions  point  to  the  continued  recovery  of\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nconsumer demand, notwithstanding higher inflation and interest rate challenges to demand.\n\n## STRATEGY, CHALLENGES AND RESULTS\n\nIn recent years, Adira Finance has implemented a strategy to continuously strengthen its automotive and non-automotive businesses. In addition, the  Company  has  also  carried  out  initiatives  to increase customer retention by presenting a more comprehensive range of products through synergy with the MUFG ecosystem, while maintaining  business  sustainability  and  stability through  prudent  risk  management  to  maintain asset quality and liquidity.\n\nIn 2023, Adira Finance implemented several strategies  and  policies  in  order  to  maintain  its position in the market, namely:\n\n- (1) Strengthen  and  gain  market  share  in  the automotive business through product diversification and by providing various attractive  sales  programs  for  customers,  as well as strengthening good relations with our dealers.\n- (2) Expand networks to non-automotive businesses by continuing to diversify the products offered to support business growth such as durables and multipurpose loans.\n- (3)  Increase customer retention by offering loyalty and  referral  programs,  as  well  as  conducting cross-selling based on needs to existing consumers. Thus providing a better customer experience to support the growth of the Company's financing.\n- (4) Accelerate digitalization within the Company and its ecosystem to improve business  efficiency  and  effectiveness  such as  performing  digital/automation  processes and  investing  in  digital  platform  (Adiraku, momobil.id,  momotor.id,  dicicilaja.co.id  and etc).\n- (5)  Continue to manage its asset quality in order to keep the NPL ratio under control by applying prudent risk-management principles.",

The Company's corporate business goals, targets, and commitments are set forth in the Company's Sustainable Finance Action Plan (SFAP), in alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  is  also  responsible  for implementing  the  strategies  and  policies  that have been established. To this end, the Board of Directors periodically and continuously monitored and evaluated the Company's progress in relation to targets  and  objectives  at  all  organizational levels, making  adjustments  as  necessary  with consideration of the business landscape and inputs from stakeholders.\n\n## Funding Activities\n\nDuring 2023, Adira Finance maintained diversified funding  sources  that  included  joint  financing with its Parent Company, Bank Danamon, as well as external borrowing which includes bank loans (onshore and offshore) and bonds. All the offshore borrowing facilities were fully hedged to mitigate the  risk  of  foreign  exchange  and  interest  rate volatility.\n\nAs of the end of 2023, this joint financing represented  47%  of the Company's  managed receivables. Meanwhile, the Company's total borrowings in December 2023 increased by 52.7% to IDR16 trillion, consisting of bank loans (onshore &amp; offshore) and bonds &amp; mudharabah bonds, each contributing  58%:42%.  As  a  result,  the  gearing ratio increased to 1.5 times in 2023 from 1.0 times in 2022, far below the regulation of 10 times.\n\nAs  part  of  the  Company's  efforts  to  diversify  its sources  of  funding,  Adira  Finance  issues  bonds on  an  annual  basis.  Adira  Finance  issued  the\n\nContinuous  Bonds  VI  Phase  I  and  Continuous Mudharabah  Bonds  V  Phase  I in July 2023, amounting  to  IDR2.0  trillion, followed by the Continuous  Bonds  VI  Phase  II  and  Continuous Mudharabah  Bonds  V  Phase  II  in November for IDR1.55 trillion. Both  were  oversubscribed, the  former  by  2.3x  and  the  latter  by  2.6x,  which demonstrates  Adira  Finance's  high  credibility  in the  bond  investor  community.  In  addition,  Adira Finance  signed  a  Social  Loan  facility  with  MUFG Bank Ltd., on 20 July 2023, the first of its kind for a multi-finance companies in Indonesia to promote financial inclusion.\n\nAdira Finance successfully maintained the highest possible  national  and  international  investment grade  ratings  with  an  idAAA/stable  assessment from the national rating agency (Pefindo), and a BBB rating from the international rating agency Fitch Rating. Additionally, Moody's  upheld  its international  rating  of  Baa1/stable  at  the  end  of 2023, which is higher than the national sovereign rating  of  Indonesia,  citing  strong  shareholders support and business synergy with Bank Danamon and MUFG group, as well as Adira Finance's solid capital  structure  and  profitability,  asset  quality and liquidity.\n\n## New Financing Disbursement\n\nContinuing  the  trend  of  the  previous  year,  the recovery of business activities boosted new financing growth for the industry as the domestic economy and consumer purchasing power recovered. Adira Finance's new financing in 2023  was  recorded  at  IDR41.6  trillion,  increasing by  31%  (yoy)  from  IDR31.7  trillion  in  2022.  The Company  realized  its  objective  of  strengthening its automotive  business,  with  its  car  financing and motorcycle financing market share growing to 9.7% and 5.0%, respectively, compared to 8.2% and 4.0% in 2022. Growth of Adira Finance's new financing was  driven by attractive and  wellexecuted  sales  programs  at  both  national  and local branch levels, as well as loyalty programs that successfully increased customer retention in 2023. Special programs were also rolled out to enhance good relations with business partners.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n49",

We expect this transaction can help to enhance our strategic collaboration, enabling us to reach a wider market as  well  as  to  strengthen  our  market  presence in the country. Ultimately, through stronger collaboration  within  MUFG  ecosystem,  we  hope that  we  can  provide  better  service  to  customers and partners.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nAfter experiencing a significant drop in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2023 the Company's performance demonstrated its recovery with recorded financing receivables of IDR55.7 trillion, a 25% year-on-year increase. This financing receivables has surpassed pre-COVID-19 pandemic amounts. This growth is in line with the increase in the Company's new financing disbursement.\n\nSimilar to 2022, the automotive segment remained the majority contributor to the Company's managed  receivables in 2023, accounting for 85%,  with  51%  attributed  to  cars  and  34%  to motorcycles. Meanwhile, the non-automotive segment  contributed  15%,  an  increase  from  the\n\nprevious year's 13% in 2022. The acceleration of this trend reflects the Company's successful business diversification and expansion into non-automotive products,  in  collaboration  with  Bank  Danamon and MUFG.\n\nIn terms of funding, in 2023,  47% of the managed receivables of the Company was funded by a joint financing  scheme  with  Bank  Danamon,  and  the remaining 53% came from the Company's external borrowing and equity.\n\n## Sustainable Financing\n\nAdira Finance maintained its commitment to holistically advancing the Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs)  and  integrating  the principles of sustainable finance into its operations, with  reference  to  the  Sustainability  Accounting Standards Board (SASB) for the consumer finance sector.

This  segment  typically  lacks  access to capital, and by doing so, the Company aims to increase  financial  inclusion.  At  the  end  of  2023, Adira  Finance's  total  loans  to  the  MSME  sector reached a portion of 24.3%, totalling IDR10.1 trillion with healthy asset quality.\n\nThe  provision  of  these  Social  Loans  is  further guided by Adira Finance's Social Financing Framework, which is aligned with the International\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n51",

Adira  Finance's  net  profit recorded  a  21.1%  year-on-year  increase,  reaching IDR1.9  trillion  in  2023.  This  increase  was  driven by  the  growth  of  total  revenue,  which  increased by  14.0%  (yoy)  toIDR9.5  trillion,  in  line  with  the increased growth of the Company's new financing disbursement. As such, the Return on Assets (ROA) and Return on Equity (ROE) for the Company were respectively 8.6% and 18.7% in 2023.\n\n| Description                                                 | Unit                            | Target 2023   | Realization 2023   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------|--------------------|\n| New Financing Disbursement                                  | IDR  trillion                   | 38.0          | 41.6               |\n| Managed Receivables                                         | IDR  trillion                   | 51.2          | 55.7               |\n| Net Profit After Tax                                        | IDR  trillion                   | 1.5           | 1.9                |\n| Non-Performing Financing Ratio  (including Joint Financing) | % of Managed Receivables        | \u00b12%           | 1.9%               |\n| New Car Market Share                                        | % Domestic New Car Sales        | 4.7%          | 5.0%               |\n| New Motorcycle Market Share                                 | % Domestic New Motorcycle Sales | 9.0%          | 9.7%               |\n\nIn line with the increase in the Company's borrowing, interest expense increased by 40% (yoy) to IDR982 billion.  On  the  other  hand,    operational  costs  remained  under  control  despite  business  expansion,  by leveraging operating efficiencies from digital technology and internal as well as internal and external synergies.\n\nTotal assets increased by 24.5% to IDR31 trillion. This improvement was primarily driven by a  25% (yoy) rise in financing receivables to IDR27.6 trillion. Asset quality was maintained, with NPF of 1.9% at the end of 2023, below the industry average.\n\n## BUSINESS PROSPECTS\n\nGlobal economic growth is expected to slow in 2024, with the IMF projecting a 2.9% growth compared to the 3.0% projection for 2023 due to high interest rates, increased energy prices, continued geopolitical tensions, and a possible slowdown for the United States and China as the two largest world economies. On the other hand, the Indonesian economy is projected to see stable or slight growth at around 4.8%5.0%,  although  further  global  tightening  or  commodity  price  declines  could  negatively  affect  growth. However, businesses that put off major decisions until the 2024 Q1 presidential and general elections are likely to start making major decisions thereafter. The elections themselves are also typically accompanied by higher household spending, which will positively impact the economy.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

Despite the global economic uncertainty, Indonesia's economic growth remains strong at 5.05% (yoy), although it is slowing compared to 2022.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n## GLOBAL ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nThe global economy  is estimated to experience yet another slowdown in 2023. According to the International Monetary Fund's (IMF) estimates, economic growth slowed  to  3.0%  (yoy)  in  2023  from  3.5% (yoy) in 2022.  The  factors  behind  the global economic slowdown in 2023 were  elevated  consumer  prices,  tighter monetary  policy, geopolitical tensions, and worsening global climate.\n\nEuropean Union's economy is estimated to grow by just 0.7% (yoy) in 2023, slower  compared  to  3.3%  (yoy)  in  2022, while the United Kingdom's GDP is also estimated to register only 0.5% (yoy) growth in the same period against 4.1% (yoy)  in  2022.  Russia,  which  experienced a  2.1%  (yoy)  contraction  in  2022  after  it invaded  Ukraine,  is  estimated  to  swing back to 2.2% (yoy) growth in 2023. United States, which grew by 2.1% (yoy) in 2022, is estimated  to  see  another  2.1%  (yoy) growth in 2023. In Asia, China's economy is  estimated to post an accelerated 5.0% (yoy)  growth  in  2023,  compared  to  3.0% (yoy)  in  2022,  while  Japan's  economy  is also estimated to grow at a faster pace of 2.0% (yoy) in 2023 from 1.0% (yoy) in 2022. India's economy  is  estimated  to  post another slowdown following a 7.2% (yoy) growth in 2022 to 6.3% (yoy) in 2023.",

Even though inflation has gradually subsided, consumers are still affected by the high prices of goods and services, resulting in the slowed recovery of household consumption by the high cost of living. Another major challenge is higher interest rates, one of the consequences of high inflation. As a result, business spending has been  adversely  impacted  and  thus  contributed to the economic slowdown. The third factor is the Middle  East's  geopolitical  conflict,  besides  the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war. Up to this point, the economic impact of the conflict in Gaza has been relatively limited, but further escalation may pose a risk to the global economy. The fourth factor is the worsening global climate, which this year has\n\nled  to  weather  irregularities  in  many  countries worldwide, leading to various detrimental natural disasters. For example, drought causes crop failures,  triggering  food  supply  disruptions  and pushing  food  prices.  Prolonged  droughts  also elevate the average temperature around the world, creating a water crisis in some parts of the globe while at the same time accelerating the meltdown of ice in the Arctic.\n\n## DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REVIEW\n\nIndonesian GDP growth is estimated to grow by 5.0%  (yoy)  in  2023  based  on  the  IMFs  projection, slower than the 5.3% (yoy) expansion in 2022. Bank Indonesia  (BI)  projected  that  the  economy  will grow between 4.5% (yoy) and 5.3% (yoy) in 2023, while the Ministry of Finance projected 5.1% (yoy) economic growth in 2023.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n145",

        "page_content": "146\n\nBased on the latest data from Statistics Indonesia, the  Indonesian  GDP  has  expanded  by  5.1%  (yoy) to  IDR12,301.4  trillion  in  2023  from  IDR11,710.2  in 2022.  A  breakdown  of  GDP  to  its  components shows  that  household  consumption  continued to be the biggest contributor to total GDP with a share of 52.7%, or equivalent to IDR6,486.3 trillion, which  was  4.8%  (yoy)  higher  than  household consumption in 2023. Gross fixed capital formation-the  second-biggest  GDP  component accounting for 31.3% of total GDP - has advanced by  4.4%  (yoy)  in  2023  to  IDR3,848.7  trillion  from 2022. Growth in exports of goods and services was at 1.3% (yoy) in 2023, but as imports of goods and services fell by 1.6% (yoy) from the same period a year earlier, net trade of goods and services have managed to grow to  IDR514.9  trillion  in  2023,  or up by 17.8% (yoy) compared to 2022. Government consumption also has expanded. It was up by 2.9% (yoy) in 2023 to IDR896.2 trillion from 2022.\n\nAfter  high  inflation  in  2022,  the  global  economy recorded  a  decline  in  inflation  rate  in  2023.  In Indonesia,  inflation  has  also  moderated  to  2.61% (yoy)  in  December  2023,  returning  to  the  Bank Indonesia's  (BI)  target  inflation  range  of  3%\u00b11%. However, BI raised its benchmark interest rate to 6% in October 2023 to maintain the stability of the Rupiah  exchange  rate  amidst  increasing  global uncertainty and as a step to anticipate the impact of inflation on the Indonesian  economy.  The Rupiah exchange rate was recorded at IDR15,416 per  US$  at  the  end  of  December  2023,  slightly improving compared to IDR15,731 per US$ at the end  of  2022,  even  as  the  United  States  Federal Reserve  raised  its  benchmark  federal  funds  rate by 100 basis points throughout 2023, taking it to 5.25%-5.50%.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n## INDUSTRY REVIEW\n\nAccording to data from the Association of Indonesian  Automotive  Industries  (Gaikindo),  car sales  in  2023  were  recorded  at  1  million  units,  or 4.1% lower than in 2022. Car sales dropped due to a slowdown in the automotive market in the second half of 2023 as a result of high-interest rates and slowing economic growth. Meanwhile, data from the  Indonesian  Motorcycle  Industry  Association (AISI)  shows  domestic  motorcycle  sales  in  2023 increased to 6.2 million units, or 19.4% compared to  2022.  This  increase  is  due  to  the  recovery  of motorcycle production caused by improved semiconductor chip supply.\n\nFurthermore, The Government's effort to encourage the use of electric vehicles in Indonesia has also shown results, as reflected by rising sales of EVs,  hybrid  EVs,  and  electric  two-wheelers. The  trend  of  increasing  electric  vehicle  usage  is expected  to  continue,  as  more  public  charging infrastructures are available, production costs fall as production technology improves, and continued support from the Government in the form of sales tax incentives. [FS10]\n\nMeanwhile, according to data from the Financing Services  Authority  (OJK),  financing  companies' net financing receivables increased from IDR415.9 trillion in 2022 to IDR470.9 trillion in 2023. Meanwhile,  the  total of financing  receivables, including  joint  financing,  amounted  to  IDR659.9 trillion in December 2023, increasing by 15% (yoy) compared to December 2022. [FS11]",

Total net income after tax also increased to IDR23.0 trillion in December 2023 from IDR20.4 trillion in December 2023.\n\nIn terms of asset quality, Non-Performing Financing  (NPF)  as  of  December  2023  showed  a slight increase to 2.44% from 2.32% in December 2022. This was in line with Bank Indonesia's tight monetary policy, which led to higher interest rates. As a result, it impacts customer payment capacity amidst  slowed  household  consumption  recovery due to the high living cost.

Consequently, the automotive and financing industries have been affected as well. Sales of cars have been weaker in 2023 compared to a year earlier,  particularly  due  to  rising  interest rates and slowing economic growth. Sales of motorcycles however, have been robust  in  2023,  driven  by  production  of motorcycle that gradually recovers as the supply of semiconductor chips improves. On  the  other  hand,  competition  within the financing industry has remained intense in 2023, as reflected by the data from  Financial Service Authority (OJK)  which  shows  that  the  number  of financing institutions has dropped to 147 in 2023 from 153 in 2022.\n\n## MARKET POSITIONING\n\nTo ensure that Adira Finance is going to stay  as  the  leading  company  within  the financing industry, the Company  has continued  to  position  itself  as  one  of the  largest  financing  companies  for  the automotive industry. As the popularity of electric vehicles (EV) continued to rise in recent years in regards to the increasing prominence of the importance of 'green living' among the society, Adira Finance has started to expand to EV financing as well. Not just as a decision to capture the opportunity,  but  also  to  prove  that  the Company also cares about the adoption of  environmentally-friendly technologies to preserve the environment.",

Changing consumer behavior post-pandemic era has been  accompanied  by  the  rapid  advancement in information  technology,  especially  in  terms the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI).  Through  its  digital  platforms,  Adira  Finance has  provided  an  easier  way  for  customers  and prospective  customers  to  access  the  Company's financing  products  online  from  anywhere  and anytime.

Bank  loans,  bonds  and  mudharabah  bonds  are  the Company's external sources of funding outside the joint financing scheme.

The higher provisioning was in line with the increase in  the  Company's  financing  receivables  in  2023 compared to 2022. The management believes that the amount of provision for impairment losses in 2023  was  sufficient  to  cover  any  potential  losses arising from uncollectible financing receivables.\n\n## Marketing and Other Expenses\n\nMarketing expenses had declined from IDR653.4 billion in 2022 to IDR611.6 billion in 2023, or by 6.4% (yoy), while the Company recorded other expenses amounted to IDR5.2 billion  in  2023  compared  to other expenses of IDR37.0 billion in 2022.

In  line with this, the Company's net income for the year had also increased from IDR1.6 trillion in 2022 to IDR1.9 trillion in 2023, or higher by 21.1% (yoy).\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income and Total Comprehensive Profit in the Current Year\n\nThe  Company  makes  a  calculation  of  its  post employment benefits, in which the actuarial gain/ (loss) that arise from adjustments and changes to the actuarial assumptions is presented in the profitand-loss  statements  and  other  comprehensive income as an account that is not reclassified into the profit-and-loss.\n\nIn addition, Adira Finance has derivative instruments which are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency exchange rate risks, both  of  which  arise  as  a  consequence  of  the Company  having  foreign  working  capital  loan transactions that are denominated  in  foreign currencies with/without floating interest rates.\n\nDerivative instruments held for risk management are  measured  at  fair  value  in  the  statement  of financial position. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative-hedging instruments of  cash  flows  is  presented  in  the  statement  of profit/(loss) and other comprehensive income for the year is expressed to be reclassified to profit or losses.\n\nIn 2023, Adira Finance's other  comprehensive income had declined from Rp87.5 billion in 2022 to  loss  other  comprehensive  by  IDR61.2  billion.

With reference to the law, the Company's cash dividend distribution policy is as follows:\n\n- 1. All  Company shares that have been fully paid-up, including shares offered during the Initial Public Offering on 31 March 2004, are similar and equal in all respects, including the rights over their cash dividends;\n- 2. In accordance with the Company's Articles of Association, dividend payments must be approved by the GMS by considering the Company's financial position and financial soundness; and\n- 3. By considering the Company's net income, current year liquidity, and without reducing the rights of the GMS to make resolutions based on the Company's Articles of Association, the Management would pay-out cash dividends amounting to a minimum of 20% of the Company's net income.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n219",

Nevertheless, the inflation rate is expected to decrease; therefore, it is anticipated that in the second semester of 2024, the central bank (BI) will lower the benchmark interest rates. Consequently, as interest rates turn lower, the economic outlook will improve, especially for the automotive and financing industries. In addition, the general election will also help boost household and Government spending through increases in economic activities. Overall, the global and domestic economies are still expected to grow in 2024.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n## MACROECONOMIC 2024\n\nThe world economy is expected to remain under pressure in 2024, at least in the first half of the year, as the lingering effects of various variables from 2023 persist. These include  elevated  consumer  prices,  tight monetary  policy, geopolitical tensions, and  worsening  global  climate.  Into  the second half,  however,  central  banks,  led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, may start to trim their interest rates. Lower rates will significantly  boost  household  spending and thus help the economy expand in the second half of 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, in Indonesia, as the inflation rate has re-entered Bank Indonesia's target range, interest rates are potentially set  to  be  lowered  in  2024.  Additionally, the  general  election  in  the  first  quarter of 2024 can stimulate household consumption and government spending.\n\nBased on the 2024 State Budget (APBN), the  Indonesian  economy is  projected  to grow by 5.2% (yoy) in 2024, slightly higher than the economic growth projection for 2023, which stands at 5.0% (yoy). Inflation is expected at 2.8% (yoy), which is within the target range of Bank Indonesia, while the exchange rate of the Rupiah is projected  to  remain  stable  at  IDR15,000 per US dollar.\n\nOther macroeconomic assumptions related to the 2024 State Budget include a 10-year Government Bond (SUN) interest  rate  of  6.7%,  a  projected  price of Indonesian  crude  oil  at  US$82  per barrel,  and  crude  oil  and  gas  lifting  at 635  thousand  barrels  per  day  and  1.03 million  barrels  of  oil  equivalent  per  day, respectively.",

Car sales dropped due to a slowdown in the automotive market in the second half of 2023 as a result of high-interest rates, slowing economic growth.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n231",

This increase  aligns  with  the  government  issuing  tax incentives  for  EV  sales.  In  2024,  the  increase  in interest in the use of EV is predicted will continue, especially if the government continues to enforce tax incentives.\n\nAs  inflation  and  interest  rates  are  projected  to decrease,  demand  for  cars  and  motorcycles  is also  predicted  to  increase.  In  addition,  increased economic activities  due  to  general  elections  will also  positively  impact  the  automotive  industry. Gaikindo  forecasts  car  sales  to  reach  1.1  million, while AISI forecasts sales of motorcycles will reach 6.2 million to 6.5 million units.\n\nIn line with the automotive industry, the financing industry  is  also  expected  to  improve  in  2024, particularly after Bank Indonesia starts to lower its interest rate. APPI projects that the growth of the multifinance industry will remain positive in 2024, with financing growth ranging between 12% and 13% (yoy), supported by the growth of investment financing,  multipurpose  financing,  and  working capital financing.\n\n## ADIRA FINANCE BUSINESS STRATEGY IN 2024\n\nIn  2024,  Adira  Finance  will  implement  several strategies  and  policies  to  maintain  its  business performance which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 The Company will strengthen and gain market share in the automotive  business  through product diversification and by providing various attractive  sales  programs  for  customers,  as well as strengthening good relations with our dealers.\n- \u00b7 Expand networks to non-automotive businesses by continuing to diversify the products offered to  support  business  growth  such  as  durables and multipurpose loans\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n- \u00b7 Increase customer retention by offering loyalty and  referral  programs,  as  well  as  conducting cross-selling based on needs to existing consumers. Thus providing a better customer experience to support the growth of the Company's financing\n- \u00b7 Accelerate  digitalization  within  the  Company and its  ecosystem  to  improve  business  efficiency and  effectiveness  such  as  performing  digital/ automation processes and investing in digital platform (Adiraku, momobil.id, momotor.id, dicicilaja.co.id and etc).\n- \u00b7 The Company will continue to manage its asset quality to keep the NPL ratio under control by applying prudent risk-management principles.\n- \u00b7 Secure and manage sufficient liquidity to fund business requirement and to meet all financial obligations.\n\n## POTENTIAL MATTERS IMPACTING BUSINESS SUSTAINABILITY\n\nAdira  Finance  does  not  record  any  factors  that could significantly affect the Company's business continuity in the long  term  in  the  financing industry. Following the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, various new challenges have emerged, such  as  elevated  consumer  prices,  high  interest rates,  slower  economic  growth,  and  geopolitical uncertainties.  These  factors  may  have  an  impact on the automotive and financing industries, which are part of Adira Finance's business ecosystem.\n\nIn connection with these challenges, Adira Finance continues  its  commitment  to  implementing  its strategies  and  policies  regarding  more  selective financing  disbursements  and  maintaining  asset quality.  To  obtain  high-quality  financing  growth, Adira  Finance  consistently  applies  its  prudent risk management  principle  by  increasing  the standards for financing approval.",

Until the publication of the 2023 annual report, there were no findings on risks that could materially impact the Company's ability to maintain its business sustainability.\n\nAdira  Finance  continues  to  implement  various efforts in managing potential factors that significantly  impact  business  continuity,  one  of which  is  by  preparing  and  publishing  financial statements  based  on  the  latest  and  sustainable Financial  Accounting  Standards.  Based  on  the performance achievement during 2023 and the  Company's  track  record,  the  Management has considered that Adira Finance's business continuity in the future is still good. The positive growth of the automotive and financing industry in 2023 is expected to continue in 2024. In addition, the  Management  believes  that  various  stimulus and  incentives  provided  by  the  Government  to support the economy, particularly the automotive and  financing  industries,  have  helped  boost  the Company's performance in 2023.\n\nAs  one  of  the  leading  financing  companies  in Indonesia with a strong track record and reliable reputation,  Adira  Finance  is  expected  to  be  able to  maintain  business  continuity  in  the  future.  In addition, the diversification of financing products towards the non-automotive segment allow the  Company  to  reduce  concentrated  risk  on automotive  industry.  Ultimately,  this  will  expand the Company's customer base.\n\nIn terms of securing its funding needs, the Company  has  continued  to  diversify  its  funding sources through continuous support of joint financing with its parent company, Bank Danamon and obtaining external borrowings including bank loans  and  bonds.  Adira  Finance  also  has  good credit-rating  standings,  namely  idAAA  (Triple  A; Stable  Outlook)  from  domestic  rating  agency Pefindo  and  investment  grade  ratings  of  Baa1 from the international rating agency Moody's and BBB from Fitch Ratings; hence that the Company can  strengthen  access  to  secure  funding  from domestic and foreign markets.\n\nIn addition to solid funding support, Adira Finance consistently  develops  its  information  technology and digital innovation to support business development by incorporating sophisticated technologies  such  as  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) and  Machine-Learning  (ML). This is line with customer  behavior  changes  towards  digital  and the increasingly competitive financing industry.\n\n## ASSUMPTIONS USED BY MANAGEMENT IN THE ASSESSMENT\n\nSeveral  factors  influence  the  assessment  of  the Company's management in managing risks that  affect  business  activities,  including  global and domestic macroeconomic developments, financing industry conditions, operational performance, financial performance, liquidity and solvency levels, governance implementation, and legal cases faced by the Company.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n233",

The GMS chairman read the rules of the GMS. The GMS chairman gave the shareholders the opportunity to ask questions on each meeting agenda. The meeting chairman and/or a member of the Board of Directors appointed gave an explanation or  response to any questions asked. After all the questions were answered, the voting was then held, whereby only the shareholders or their legal representatives can vote. Each 1 share gives the shareholder the right of 1 vote.\n\n## Independent Party as Vote Counter\n\nTo perform vote counting in every agenda of the GMS, the Company appointed Notary Mala Mukti S.H., LL.M. and PT Adimitra Jasa Korpora as the party performing the vote count or validating the votes.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n245",

The GMS chairman read the rules of the GMS. The GMS chairman gave the shareholders the opportunity to ask questions on each meeting agenda. The meeting chairman and/or a member of the Board of Directors appointed gave an explanation or  response to any questions asked. After all the questions were answered, the voting was then held, whereby only the shareholders or their legal representatives can vote. Each 1 share gives the shareholder the right of 1 vote.\n\n## Independent Party as Vote Counter\n\nTo perform vote counting in every agenda of the GMS, the Company appointed Notary Mala Mukti S.H., LL.M. and PT Adimitra Jasa Korpora as the party performing the vote count or validating the votes.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

A controlling shareholder is a party regardless of  the  proportion  of  share  ownership,  which has de facto influence over important matters including  the  management  of  the  Company, such  as  the  appointment  and  dismissal  of management. Therefore, the controlling shareholders must use their power in selecting candidates for positions in the Board of Commissioners  and  Directors  who  have  high integrity and competence to be able to manage and control the Company in a healthy manner;\n- 6.

Therefore,  the controlling  shareholders,  in  addition  to  their right to vote on the shares they own by virtue of their direct participation in the management of the Company as directors, are obliged to accept the responsibility imposed on them due to the power  conferred  on  them  in  relation  to  their influence over the Company management;\n- 7.

In the event that a deliberation decision to reach a consensus is not reached, the decision is taken by voting in favor of more than \u00bd of the total votes legally cast at the meeting. In the event the votes in favor and the votes against are equal, then the proposal is considered rejected. Each member of  the  Board  of  Commissioners  present  at  the meeting has the right to cast 1 (one) vote and an additional 1 (one) vote for each other represented member of the Board of Commissioners.\n\nEach  member  of  the  Board  of  Commissioners who  personally,  in  any  way,  either  directly  or indirectly, has interests in a transaction, contract, or contract proposal in which the Company is one of the parties must state the nature of the interest in  a  Board  of  Commissioners Meeting and is not entitled to participate in voting on matters related to the transaction or contract, unless the Board of Commissioners meeting determines otherwise.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nManagement\n\nDiscussion\n\nand Analysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe Board of Commissioners may also take valid and binding decisions without holding the Board of Commissioners  Meeting,  provided  that  the entire  members  of  the  Board  of  Commissioners approve  the  proposal  submitted  in  writing  and sign  the  agreement.

The Company's business performance can also be enjoyed by the shareholders in the form of dividend distribution by the Company;\n- 5.

Tuesday, November 19, 2024.\n\nThe  meeting  plan  may  change  in  the  event  of request from a majority of the Company's Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors members.\n\n## BOARD OF DIRECTORS MEETING\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  may  hold  at  least  1  (one) meeting  in  a  month,  unless  deemed  necessary by 1 (one) member of the Board of Directors, or at the  written  request  of  1  (one)  or  more  members of the Board of Commissioners, or at the written request  of  1  (one)  or  more  shareholders  jointly own 1/10 (one-tenth) of the total shares issued by the Company with valid voting rights. The Board of  Directors  meeting  is  only  valid  and  can  make binding  decisions  if  more  than  \u00bd  (one  half)  of the  total  members  of  the  Board  of  Directors  are present or represented at the meeting.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nThe Board of Directors meeting resolution must be taken based on deliberation to reach a consensus. In the event that a deliberation decision to reach a consensus is not reached, the decision is taken by voting in favor of more than. \u00bd (one-half) of the total votes validly cast at the meeting. In the event that the votes in favor and the votes against are equal,  then  the  proposal  is  considered  rejected. Each member of the Board of Directors present at the meeting has the right to cast 1 (one) vote and an additional 1 (one) vote for each other represented member of the Board of Directors.\n\nEach  member  of  the  Board  of  Directors  who personally, in any way, either directly or indirectly, has  an  interest in a transaction, contract, or proposed  contract to which  the Company  is one of the parties must state the nature of their interests in a Board of Directors Meeting and is not entitled to participate in voting related to matters concerning the transaction or contract, unless the Board of Directors Meeting determines otherwise.\n\nThe Board of Directors may also make valid and binding  decisions  without  holding  the  Board  of Directors'  meeting,  provided  that  all  members of  the  Board  of  Directors  approve  the  proposal submitted  in  writing  and  sign  the  agreement. Decisions taken in this way have the same power as decisions taken legally at a Board of Directors meeting.",

This  is outlined in the Guidelines and Work Procedures of the Company's Audit Committee, FSA Regulation No. 55/POJK.04/2015 regarding the Establishment and  Guidelines for the Work  Implementation of the Audit Committee, FSA Regulation No.  30/POJK.05/2014  concerning  Good  Corporate Governance for Financing Companies as amended by OJK Regulation No. 29/POJK.05/2020.\n\n## Establishment of the Company's Audit\n\n## Committee\n\nThe Company's Audit Committee was first established on August 30, 2004 at a meeting of the Company's Board of Commissioners.\n\nOn November 29, 2005 based on the decision of the Company's Board of Commissioners, the Audit Committee  and  Risk  Management  Committee were merged into the Audit and Risk Management Committee.\n\nWith the development of the Company's business and the greater challenges that the Audit Committee  had  to  deal  with,  there  is  a  need to  segregate  the  Audit  and  Risk  Management Committees. Based on these considerations, on  April  28,  2011,  the  Company's  Audit  and  Risk Management  Committees  were  segregated  into the Audit Committee and the Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Audit Committee Guidelines and Work Procedures\n\nAdira Finance's Audit Committee has had Guidelines and Work Procedures since 2004 which has been reviewed and revised them several times. The Audit Committee Guidelines and Work Rules were last revised on September 21, 2022.\n\nThe Audit Committee's Guidelines and Work Rules has also been uploaded to the Company's official website at www.adira.co.id.\n\n## Membership\n\nThe  composition  of  the  members  of  the  Adira Finance Audit Committee is in accordance with  the  Decision  of  the  Company's  Board  of Commissioners effective from July 1, 2022 until the closing of the 2023 Annual GMS which will be held at the latest on June 30, 2024, and is as follows:\n\nChairman :  Manggi Taruna Habir (Independent\n\nCommissioner)\n\nMember\n\n: Jusuf Sukiman (Independent Party)\n\nMember\n\n: Restiana Ie Tjoe Linggadjaya\n\n(Independent Party)\n\nInformation regarding concurrent positions, work experience and educational history of each member of the Audit Committee who still holds office  until  the  publication  of  the  2023  Annual Report can be seen in the Company Data Section Audit Committee Profile.\n\n## Independence of the Audit Committee\n\nAll committee members have met all independence  criteria  and  are  able  to  carry  out their  duties  and  responsibilities  independently, uphold the interests of the Company and cannot be influenced by any party.\n\nThe independency of the members of the Company's  Audit  Committee  can  be  observed from the data on their respective family relations, finances,  management,  and  share  ownership  of each member of the Audit Committee.\n\nThe family and financial relationships of members of the Audit Committee with members of the Board of Commissioners and/or members of the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company are as follows:\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n315",

The Company's business activities are always in line with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Financial and Operational Control\n\nThe  Company's  internal  control  system  includes, among others, financial and operational control.\n\nFinancial control consists of organizational structure, procedures and recording/ documentation systems related to the management  and  security of the Company's assets and the reliability of financial records and their consequences. The organizational structure, procedures and recording/documentation system are  structured  to  provide  sufficient  assurance  in terms of:\n\n- \u00b7 Transactions  are  carried  out  in  accordance with the approval (authorization) of the management that has been determined according to their duties and responsibilities;\n- \u00b7 Transactions are recorded to (1) enable the preparation of financial statements  in accordance with applicable accounting standards or other criteria necessary for these reports and (2) demonstrate accountability for the management of the Company's assets;\n- \u00b7 Use of Company assets is only permitted if it is in accordance with Management's authorization;\n- \u00b7 The responsibility for documenting/ administering the Company's assets is compared  with  existing  assets  at  any  given time and necessary action is taken if there are differences.\n\nOperational control includes organizational structure and procedures as well as records relating to the decision-making process related to the authorization of transactions by Management.

One  of  the  implementations  of  Good  Corporate Governance is to ensure that the internal control system has been implemented adequately.\n\nThe  Board  of  Directors  has  the  responsibility  to implement  a  good  internal  control  system  to achieve the Company's objectives.

Companies are increasingly required to be able to recognize and manage the risks of the activities they deal with to an acceptable level.  The  Company  perceives  risk  management as  very  important,  therefore  the  Company  has had a Risk Management Directorate early on. The Risk  Management Directorate in carrying out its activities  is  supported  by  the  Risk  Management Committee which is responsible to the Company's Board of Directors.\n\nThe  main  tasks  of  the  Directorate  of  Corporate Risk  Management  include  conducting  analysis to  identify  the  risks  that  are  being  and  will  be encountered by the Company, formulating recommendations for the level of risk that can be taken by Management and the level of tolerance for  each  risk  and  formulating  risk  management policies to maintain the level of risk in the Company.\n\nIn  addition,  risk  management  has  also  received attention from the Board of Commissioners, which through the Risk Management Committee under the Board of Commissioners, continuously oversee and  supervises  risk  management  carried  out  by the Company's Directors.\n\nThe Company has identified the risks encountered by the Company which consist of:\n\n- 1. Microeconomic  risk  which  consists  of  credit risk, operational risk, market risk, liquidity risk, legal risk, compliance risk, reputation risk and strategic risk;\n- 2. Macroeconomic risk which consists of economic risk,  social  and  security  risk,  monetary  policy risk,  exchange  rate  risk,  risk  of  global  crisis impact,  risk  of  availability  and  demand  for motor vehicles and competition risk;\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nRisk assessment is carried out on a quarterly basis to  measure the level of risk being faced and the estimated  level  of  risk  that  will  be  met  by  the Company.  The  measurement  results  along  with recommendations for improvement or anticipation are submitted to the Board of Directors. The results of  this  analysis  are  also  submitted  to  the  Risk Management  Committee  under  the  Company's Board of Commissioners.\n\nA more detailed explanation of risk management performance during 2023 can be seen in the Risk Management Section.\n\n## Control Activities\n\nControl  activities  are  all  policies  and  procedures to  ensure  that  the  actions  needed  to  address risks are actually implemented in order to achieve organizational goals. The effectiveness of control  activities  will  depend  on  the  accuracy  in identifying  and  measuring  the  risks  carried  out by  the  company.  Several  policies  taken  by  the Company in controlling activities include:\n\n- \u00b7 Assign  tasks,  responsibilities  and  authorities in accordance  with  the  functions of each organizational unit;\n- \u00b7 Prepare  good  data  recording/administration and storage of Company documents;\n- \u00b7 Prepare  the  security  of  Company  data  and documents properly;\n- \u00b7 Conduct an assessment or examination of the Company's  performance  by  an  independent party such as a public accounting firm.\n\n## Information and communication technology\n\nThe Company realizes that the control components (control environment,  risk  assessment,  control activities, monitoring)  will  be  easily  realized  if there  is a good  and  reliable  information  and communication system in the organization. Information and communication systems are said  to  be  good  and  reliable  if  every  member of  the  organization  gets  a  clear  message  about what  must  be  done,  so  that  the  overall  goals  of individuals, each section and the company can be accomplished.\n\nThe  Company  already  has  policies  as  guidelines for  information  and  communication  technology.

These guidelines are made so that the management of information and communication technology-based companies can be  carried  out  effectively,  efficiently,  reliably  and has a high level of security.\n\nThe achievements made  by the Information Technology Directorate include evaluating and revising Adira Finance's information and communication  technology  guidelines  including information  technology  governance,  roles  and functions of Adira Finance's information and communication  technology,  risk  management, service management, security management, monitoring and evaluation of utilization. information and communication technology systems  to  ensure  the  effectiveness  of  internal control and maintain compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\n## Monitoring\n\nThe entire process should be monitored, and the necessary modifications made. Thus, the internal control system is dynamic and changes according to the demands of the conditions.\n\nMonitoring is a continuous effort to ensure that every movement of the Company is synergistically leading to efforts to achieve goals. This  is  done  by  reassessing  the  strength  of  the control environment, risk assessment efforts and  selection  of  control  activities.  An  important element in monitoring is reporting on deviations and deficiencies.\n\nMonitoring and evaluation is carried  out,  among others by:\n\n- \u00b7 Supervision of each level of management within the Company;\n- \u00b7 An accountability and assessment system that allows for an assessment of each member of the management and units within the Company's organization;\n- \u00b7 Implementation of supervision through internal audit conducted by the Internal Audit Unit;\n- \u00b7 Implementation of supervision through examination  by  independent  parties  such  as public accounting firms;\n- \u00b7 Implementation of supervision by the Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Supervision by the Audit Committee, particularly in relation to the Company's financial records;\n- \u00b7 Supervision by the Risk Management Committee, particularly with regard to operational activities and the Company's compliance with applicable laws and regulations;\n- \u00b7 Supervision by the Board of Commissioners of the  entire  implementation  of  the  Company's management  activities carried out by the Board of Directors.\n\nEvaluation of the internal control system implemented  by  the  Company  is  carried  out periodically and  at any time if necessary  by involving the Company's Internal Audit as well as an Independent External Auditor.\n\nAlthough  the  company  realizes that there is no  internal  control  system  that  can  eliminate all  existing  business  risks,  the  company  strives to  be  able  to  manage  and  control  these  risks to a minimum.  Based  on  the  results  of  the evaluation  during  2023,  the  Company  considers that  the  internal  control  system  that  has  been implemented  by  the  Company  is  in  accordance with the Company's needs to ensure the achievement of the Company's objectives. This can be  seen  from  the  results  of  the  assessment  and recommendations from the Internal Audit Division which  showed  better  progress,  except  for  the results of the Internal Audit Division's examination of the newly established business network of the Company, which is still in the process of improving and  perfecting  procedures.

Pay  attention  to  factors  that  affect  risk including additional risks.\n\n## 2.  Risk Measurement\n\nAccurate measurement of risk is very important.  Risk  measurement  is  conducted periodically and thoroughly for the Company's business activities. Risk must be measurable so that  the  adequacy  of  reserves  and  the  ability of capital to absorb the resulting risks can be determined.\n\nThe  risk measurement  system,  technology, or model  will be adjusted to the nature, size, and complexity of the business and must  be  able  to  capture  all  risk  exposures. Assumptions underlying risk identification and measurement  must  be  validated  and  clearly understood by risk management officials. Risk measurement may utilize  quantitative  and/or qualitative methods.\n\nImportant steps to establish a risk measurement process are:\n\n- a. Assigning officials with expertise and experience in determining the risk measurement process;\n- b. Ensure the availability of sufficient, appropriate and accurate data and information;\n- c.

Legal Risks\n\nLegal risk is a risk resulting from lawsuits and/ or weaknesses in legal/juridical aspects.\n\nLegal risk  can  arise  from  a  variety  of  sources, including  weaknesses  in  the  juridical  aspects caused  by  the  Company's  engagement,  the absence and/or changes in laws and regulations that  cause  a  transaction  carried  out  by  the Company to be in  violation  of  the  provisions, and  litigation processes  arising from  both third-party  claims  against  the  Company  and the Company's claims against third parties.\n\nThe  Company  has  established  standards  and procedures  for  the  implementation  of  legal risk  management.  In  addition,  the  Company has a code of ethics for its employees to use as a working guideline, as well as limits on legal risks.\n\nOn a regular basis, the Company also provides training  and  socialization  to  relevant  internal parties  to  support  the  Company's  operational processes related to legal risk.\n\nThe  Company  has  a  policy  in  place  for  the implementation  of legal risk management (including  the  provision  of  legal  assistance), which is reviewed on a regular basis in accordance with the Company's internal conditions as well as changes in the applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company has set limits for legal cases, such as  the  number  of  cases,  potential  losses,  and the  outcome  of  legal  proceedings,  which  are regularly monitored and reported to the Board of Directors and Board of Commissioners.\n\nThe  Company  has  identified  and  analyzed the factors that may result in the emergence of  legal  risks  in  its  products,  processes,  and information  technology,  which  will  have  an impact on its financial position and reputation. The  process  of  assessing  legal  risk  employs both qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n\nTo  expedite  the  handling  of  legal  cases  at the area and branch levels, the Company has established  a  legal  unit  at  the  area  level  that works  directly  with  the  Legal  Division  of  the head  office  as  well  as  the  area  and  branch offices.\n\n## 7.

Legal behavior, namely the Company's behavior or activities that deviate or violate from the provisions and/or laws and regulations;\n- b. Organizational behavior, namely the Company's behavior or activities that deviate  or  contradict  from  the  generally accepted standards.\n\nThe Company's compliance risk management strategy includes:\n\n- a.

The  type  and  significance  of  the  offence committed;\n- b. Frequency of violations (including sanctions) or the Company's compliance track record;\n- c. Violations  of  the  provisions  of  laws  and regulations or generally accepted business standards;\n- d.

Such policies include communication guidelines for dealing with customers and third parties. In addition to these  policies,  the  Company  is  subject  to  the applicable  regulations  of  the  Indonesia  Stock Exchange and the Financial Services Authority (OJK), so when disclosing information to the  public,  the  Company  also  refers  to  the provisions of the Capital Market legislation.\n\nTo manage reputation risk, the Company must ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe Company responds as soon as possible to customer complaints or legal actions that may increase reputation risk.\n\nThe Company is also committed to implementing Corporate Social  Responsibility (CSR)  programs  that  involve  the  surrounding community while always keeping an eye on the balance of economic, social, and environmental aspects, which can lead to a positive response from stakeholders.\n\nThe effectiveness of reputation risk management implementation can be seen in the  negative  news  and  customer  complaints managed  by  the  Company  in  2023,  which remain within the Company's risk appetite and risk tolerance.\n\n## Risk Control Focus and Initiatives in 2024\n\nDue  to  the  ongoing  uncertainty  in  the  global economy, 2024 will continue to be a difficult year for the  entire  world,  including  Indonesia.  The escalation of global conflict tensions, an economic slowdown in Asia and Europe, high global inflation, interest  rates  that  are  expected  to  remain  high, food  and  energy  security  vulnerabilities  due  to climate  change,  commodity  price  volatility,  and Indonesia's  transition  to  a  political  year  in  2024 are all factors influencing the global economy and Indonesia.\n\nThe  Indonesian  government  predicts  that  the country's  economy  will  grow  by  around  5.2%  in 2024.  The  projected  national  economic  growth rate in 2024 is significantly higher than the global economy,  which  is  expected  to  grow  at  2.9%. According to these projections, this is an excellent opportunity for the company to continue growing while adhering to the precautionary principle.\n\nIn  response  to  this  situation,  the  Company  must devise  a  strategy  that  can  be  implemented  on target.  One  of  the  Company's  main  strategies  is the implementation of careful and balanced risk management, which will serve as the foundation\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n377",

Understanding of the importance of compliance  with  regulations  as  part  of  Good Corporate  Governance  practices  is  not  evenly distributed across all lines of the organization. This  has  an  impact  on  the  less-than-optimal results  of  the  implementation  of  Corporate Governance related to the duties of the compliance function;\n- 2. The Corporate Governance Structure is imperfect in the Company's risk management function, where the person in charge of the Company's  risk management  function is currently not specifically held by a Risk Management Director, so that the implementation of the risk management function is not optimal.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n411",

Governance structure\n\n- -The strengths of the Company's governance structure  are:\n- \u00b7 The duties and responsibilities of the Company's Board of Commissioners  have been carried out effectively and comply with the principles of Good Corporate Governance. Members of the Board of Commissioners are able to act and make decisions independently, have competence and integrity in accordance with the size and complexity of the Company's business and have complied with applicable regulations. In addition, the Board of Commissioners Meeting is also held effectively and efficiently.\n- \u00b7 The duties and responsibilities of the Board of Directors have been carried out properly, effectively and in accordance with the principles of Good Corporate Governance. The number and composition of the Board of Directors have complied with applicable regulations, where members of the Board of Directors are able to act and make decisions independently, have competence and integrity in accordance with the size and complexity of the Company's business. In addition, Board of Directors Meetings are also held effectively and efficiently.\n- -The weakness of the Company's governance structure aspect is the number of Independent Commissioners which is only 33.3% of the total Board of Commissioners. Based on the principles of Corporate Governance in the ASEAN CG Scorecard, the number of Independent Commissioners is at least 50% of the total Board of Commissioners.\n\n## B. Governance process\n\n- -The strength of the Company'  s governance process aspect is that the completeness and implementation of the Committee's duties are considered good considering that the implementation of the Committee's duties has been effective, the Committee's recommendations are quite useful and can be used as reference material for the decisions of the Board of Commissioners, and the holding of Committee meetings has run in accordance with the work guidelines of each Committee and is carried out effectively and efficiently.\n- -The weakness of the  Company's governance process aspect is that the majority of members of the Company's Nomination and Remuneration Committee are Commissioners, while in the ASEAN CG Scorecard, the majority of members of the Nomination and Remuneration Committee should be Independent Commissioners.\n\n## C. Governance outcomes\n\n- -The strength of the aspects of the implementation of the Company's governance outcomes is that the Company is always transparent in submitting financial statements and non-financial reports. These reports are submitted in a complete, accurate, relevant and complete manner and on time in accordance with applicable regulations.\n- -The weakness of the Company's governance outcome is that there are still business practices that are not in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Services Authority, so adjustments need to be made to be able to achieve full compliance with national and international standards.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n427",

Consideration of Environmental Aspects in Financing Requirements [FS2][FS3]\n\nAdira Finance has undertaken various initiatives to consider the environmental aspects of its financing requirements to support  environmental  sustainability  efforts, among others: [SEOJK F.12]\n\n- a. Providing a maximum age requirement for vehicles that can be financed, so the vehicles that  use  non-eco-friendly  technology  are expected  to  decrease.  The  maximum  age of  vehicles  that  can  be  financed  by  Adira Finance is 12 years (passenger cars), 10 years (commercial cars), 10 years (motorcycles) at the end of the financing period.\n- b. As  we  know,  motor  vehicle  manufacturers have recently been trying to meet environmentally friendly standards in order to market their products in European countries that have stringent requirements\n\nfor maximum  exhaust gas limits, and are usually getting stricter every year. By  limiting  the  age  of  motor  vehicles,  it is expected  that  the  engine  technology used  is  more  environmentally  friendly.  On the  other  hand,  the  engine  is  usually  still maintained  and  still complies  with  the maximum exhaust level requirements.\n\n- c. Requiring  consumers  to  always  maintain and  care  for  collateral,  in  this  case  in  the form  of  motorized  vehicles,  so  that  it  is hoped  that  with  good  maintenance  and care,  it  will  be  able  to  minimize  pollution, both air and noise pollution.\n\n## Budget/Costs Incurred [FS8]\n\nAdira  Finance  has  designed  a  plan  of  activities, personnel  required,  and  costs  for  investment  in environmental  management.  Throughout  2023, the environmental costs incurred by the Company amounted to IDR2.85 billion.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n463",

Kami yakin bahwa bukti audit yang telah kami peroleh adalah  cukup  dan  tepat  untuk  menyediakan  suatu basis bagi opini audit kami.\n\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing established by the Indonesian Institute of Certified Public Accountants. Our responsibilities  under  those  standards  are  further described  in  the Auditor's  Responsibilities  for  the Audit of  the  Financial  Statements paragraph  of  our report.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.\n\n## Hal Audit Utama\n\n## Key Audit Matters\n\nHal audit utama adalah hal-hal yang, menurut pertimbangan profesional kami, merupakan hal yang paling signifikan dalam  audit kami  atas laporan keuangan periode kini. Hal-hal tersebut disampaikan dalam  konteks  audit  kami  atas  laporan  keuangan secara  keseluruhan,  dan  dalam  merumuskan  opini kami atas laporan keuangan  terkait, kami tidak menyatakan suatu opini terpisah atas hal audit utama tersebut.\n\nBerikut adalah uraian atas hal audit utama yang kami identifikasi dalam audit kami.\n\nThe  following is the key  audit matter  that we identified in our audit.\n\n## Cadangan  kerugian  penurunan  nilai  atas  piutang pembiayaan konsumen dan piutang sewa pembiayaan\n\nMengacu pada Catatan 2h Kebijakan Akuntansi yang Signifikan -Cadangan  Kerugian  Penurunan  Nilai; Catatan 3a Penggunaan Estimasi dan Pertimbangan Sumber  Utama  Ketidakpastian  Estimasi:  Cadangan Kerugian Penurunan Nilai Aset Keuangan; Catatan 5 Piutang  Pembiayaan  Konsumen;  Catatan  7  Piutang Sewa Pembiayaan; dan Catatan 37 Manajemen Risiko Keuangan - Risiko Kredit.\n\nRefer  to  Note  2h  Significant  Accounting  Policies  Allowance  for  Impairment  Losses;  Note  3a  Use  of Estimates and Judgments - Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty:  Allowance  for  Impairment  Losses  on Financial Assets; Note 5 Consumer Financing Receivables; Note 7 Finance Lease Receivables; and Note 37 Financial Risk Management - Credit Risk.\n\nPada tanggal 31 Desember 2023, Perseroan mencatat piutang pembiayaan konsumen dan piutang  sewa  pembiayaan  masing-masing  sebesar Rp  21.951.219  juta  dan  Rp  1.505.070  juta,  dan cadangan  kerugian  penurunan  nilai atas piutang pembiayaan konsumen dan piutang sewa pembiayaan tersebut masing-masing sebesar Rp  1.270.590  juta  dan  Rp  60.770  juta.

Hal ini meliputi:\n\nIn determining the ECL, the Company  utilizes modelling methodologies which are reliant on internal  and  external  data  as  well  as  a  number  of estimates.  We  focused  on  this  area  due  to  the significance of the carrying value of consumer financing receivables and finance lease receivables, which  represented  71%  of  the  total  assets  of  the Company as at December 31, 2023 and the related ECL provided, specifically  the  subjective  judgments used by management in determining the necessity for,  and  estimating  the  size  of,  ECL  against  these consumer  financing  receivables  and  finance  lease receivables. These includes:\n\n- \u00b7 ekspektasi  faktor  dan  skenario  ekonomi  makro masa depan; dan\n- \u00b7 expectations of forward-looking macroeconomic factors and scenarios; and\n- \u00b7 asumsi-asumsi model.\n- \u00b7 the model assumptions.\n\nMengingat faktor-faktor tersebut, kami mengidentifikasi ini sebagai hal audit utama.\n\nIn view of these factors, we identified this as a key audit matter.\n\n## Bagaimana audit kami merespon hal audit utama\n\n## How our audit addressed the key audit matters\n\nKami memeroleh pemahaman tentang pengendalian yang relevan terhadap audit kami dan menilai desain dan  implementasi  dari  pengendalian  tersebut  serta mengevaluasi  efektivitas  operasi  dari  pengendalian yang relevan terhadap KKE atas piutang pembiayaan konsumen  dan  piutang  sewa  pembiayaan.  Hal  ini meliputi:\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding  of  the  controls relevant  to  our  audit  and  assessed  the  design  and implementation  of  the  controls  and  evaluated  the operating  effectiveness  of  such  relevant  controls over the ECL for consumer financing receivables and finance lease receivables.

Keyakinan memadai merupakan  suatu  tingkat  keyakinan  tinggi,  namun bukan  merupakan  suatu  jaminan  bahwa  audit  yang dilaksanakan  berdasarkan  Standar  Audit akan  selalu mendeteksi  kesalahan  penyajian  material  ketika  hal tersebut ada. Kesalahan penyajian dapat disebabkan oleh  kecurangan  maupun  kesalahan  dan  dianggap material  jika,  baik  secara  individual  maupun  secara agregat,  dapat  diekspektasikan  secara  wajar  akan memengaruhi keputusan ekonomi yang diambil oleh pengguna berdasarkan laporan keuangan tersebut.\n\nOur  objectives  are  to  obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to  fraud  or  error,  and  to  issue  an  auditor's  report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\n\nSebagai bagian dari suatu audit berdasarkan Standar Audit,  kami  menerapkan  pertimbangan  profesional dan mempertahankan skeptisisme profesional selama audit. Kami juga:\n\nAs part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing,  we  exercise  professional  judgment  and maintain  professional  skepticism  throughout  the audit. We also:\n\n- \u00b7 Mengidentifikasi  dan menilai risiko kesalahan penyajian material dalam laporan keuangan, baik yang disebabkan oleh kecurangan maupun kesalahan, mendesain dan melaksanakan prosedur  audit  yang  responsif  terhadap  risiko tersebut, serta memeroleh bukti audit yang cukup dan  tepat  untuk  menyediakan  basis  bagi  opini kami. Risiko tidak terdeteksinya kesalahan penyajian material yang disebabkan oleh kecurangan lebih tinggi dari yang disebabkan oleh kesalahan, karena kecurangan dapat melibatkan kolusi, pemalsuan, penghilangan secara sengaja, pernyataan salah, atau pengabaian pengendalian internal.\n- \u00b7 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether  due  to  fraud  or  error,  design  and perform  audit  procedures  responsive  to  those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and  appropriate  to  provide  a  basis  for our opinion.  The  risk  of  not  detecting  a  material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one  resulting from  error,  as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations,  or  the  override  of  internal control.\n- \u00b7 Memeroleh suatu pemahaman tentang pengendalian internal yang relevan dengan audit untuk mendesain  prosedur  audit yang tepat sesuai  kondisinya, tetapi bukan  untuk  tujuan menyatakan opini atas keefektivitasan pengendalian internal Perseroan.\n- \u00b7 Obtain  an  understanding  of  internal  control relevant  to  the  audit  in  order  to  design  audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose  of expressing  an  opinion  on  the  effectiveness  of the Company's internal control.\n- \u00b7 Mengevaluasi ketepatan kebijakan akuntansi yang digunakan serta kewajaran estimasi akuntansi dan pengungkapan terkait yang dibuat oleh manajemen.\n- \u00b7 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting  estimates  and  related  disclosures made by management.\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

Klasifikasi (lanjutan)\n\n## d.1. Classification (continued)\n\nAset  keuangan  hanya  dapat  dikategorikan  sebagai biaya  perolehan  diamortisasi  jika  instrumen  dimiliki dalam  rangka  mendapatkan  arus  kas  kontraktual (' hold  to  collect '),  dan  dimana  arus  kas  kontraktual tersebut semata dari pembayaran pokok dan bunga (SPPI).  'Pokok'  didefinisikan  sebagai  nilai  wajar dari aset keuangan pada pengakuan awal. 'Bunga' didefinisikan sebagai:\n\n- -imbalan untuk nilai waktu atas uang;\n- -risiko  kredit  yang  terkait  dengan  jumlah  pokok yang terutang selama periode waktu tertentu;\n- -risiko dan biaya pinjaman dasar lainnya (misalnya risiko likuiditas dan biaya administrasi); dan\n- -marjin keuntungan.\n\nDalam menilai apakah arus kas kontraktual adalah SPPI, Perseroan mempertimbangkan  ketentuan kontraktual  instrumen  tersebut.  Hal  ini  termasuk menilai apakah aset keuangan mengandung ketentuan kontraktual yang dapat mengubah waktu atau  jumlah  arus  kas  kontraktual  sehingga  tidak memenuhi kondisi ini. Dalam melakukan penilaian, Perseroan mempertimbangkan ketentuan percepatan perlunasan dan perpanjangan.\n\nIn assessing whether the contractual cash flows are SPPI, the Company considers the contractual terms of the instrument. This includes assessing whether the financial asset contains a contractual term that could  change  the  timing  or  amount  of  contractual cash flows such that it would not meet this condition. In making the assessment, the Company considers prepayment and extension terms.\n\n## d.2.  Pengakuan\n\n## d.2.  Recognition\n\nPerseroan pada awalnya mengakui aset keuangan dan liabilitas keuangan pada tanggal perolehan.\n\nThe  Company  initially  recognises  financial  assets and financial liabilities on the date of origination.\n\nPerseroan menggunakan akuntansi tanggal penyelesaian ketika mencatat transaksi aset keuangan.\n\nPada  saat  pengakuan  awal,  aset  keuangan  atau liabilitas keuangan  Perseroan  diukur  pada  nilai wajar ditambah/dikurangi biaya transaksi yang dapat diatribusikan secara langsung atas perolehan aset keuangan atau penerbitan liabilitas keuangan. Pengukuran aset keuangan dan liabilitas keuangan setelah pengakuan awal tergantung  pada  klasifikasi aset keuangan  dan liabilitas keuangan tersebut.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nThe  Company  uses  settlement  date  accounting when recording financial assets transactions.\n\nAt initial recognition, the Company's financial assets  or  financial  liabilities  are  measured  at  fair values plus/minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or issuance  of  financial  liabilities. The  subsequent measurement  of financial assets and financial liabilities depends on their classification.\n\nFinancial  assets  can  only  be  classified  at  amortized cost if the instruments are held in order to collect the contractual  cash  flows  ('hold  to  collect'),  and  where those  contractual  cash  flows  are  solely  payments  of principal and interest (SPPI). 'Principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset on initial recognition.  'Interest'  is  defined  as  consideration for:\n\n- -the time value of money;\n- -credit  risk  associated  with  the  principal  amount outstanding during a particular period of time;\n- -other  basic  lending  risks and  costs  (e.g. liquidity risk and administrative costs); and\n- -profit margin.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## 2.

Untuk  aset  keuangan,  biaya  transaksi ditambahkan  pada  jumlah  yang  diakui  pada  awal pengakuan aset, sedangkan untuk liabilitas keuangan, biaya transaksi dikurangkan dari jumlah utang yang diakui pada awal pengakuan kewajiban.  Biaya  transaksi  tersebut  diamortisasi selama umur instrumen berdasarkan metode suku bunga  efektif dan  dicatat sebagai bagian dari pendapatan pembiayaan konsumen, marjin murabahah  dan  sewa  pembiayaan  untuk  biaya transaksi  sehubungan dengan aset keuangan dan sebagai  bagian  dari  beban  bunga  untuk  biaya transaksi sehubungan dengan liabilitas keuangan.\n\nTransaction costs include only those costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition of a financial asset or issuance of a financial liability and they are incremental costs that would not have been incurred if the instrument had not been acquired or issued. In the case of financial assets, transaction costs are added to the amount recognised initially, while  for  financial  liabilities,  transaction  costs  are deducted  from  the  amount  of  debt  recognised initially. Such transaction costs are amortised over the terms of the instruments based on the effective interest method and are recorded as part of consumer financing, murabahah margin and finance leases income for transaction costs related to financial assets and as part of interest expenses for transaction costs related to financial liabilities.\n\nSetelah  pengakuan  awal,  aset  keuangan  yang diklasifikasikan sebagai biaya perolehan diamortisasi dicatat sebesar biaya perolehan diamortisasi (lihat Catatan 2d.5) dengan menggunakan metode suku bunga efektif. Sedangkan aset keuangan yang diukur pada nilai wajar melalui penghasilan komprehensif lain dicatat sebesar nilai wajar.\n\nSetelah pengakuan awal, liabilitas keuangan dicatat  pada  biaya  perolehan  diamortisasi  (lihat Catatan 2d.5) dengan menggunakan metode suku bunga efektif.\n\n## d.3.  Penghentian pengakuan\n\n## d.3.

Setiap hak  atau  kewajiban  atas aset keuangan  yang ditransfer yang timbul atau yang masih dimiliki oleh Perseroan diakui sebagai aset atau liabilitas secara terpisah.\n\nPerseroan menghentikan pengakuan liabilitas keuangan  pada  saat  kewajiban  yang  ditetapkan dalam  kontrak  dilepaskan  atau  dibatalkan  atau kadaluwarsa.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nThe Company derecognises a financial asset when the  contractual  rights  to  the  cash  flows  from  the asset  expire,  or  when  the  Company  transfers  the rights  to  receive  the  contractual  cash  flows  on  the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any rights and obligations  in  transferred  financial  assets  that  are created or retained by the Company are recognised as a separate asset or liability.\n\nThe Company  derecognises  a financial liability when  its  contractual  obligations  are  discharged  or cancelled or expired.\n\nSubsequent  to  initial  recognition,  financial  assets classified as amortised cost are measured  at amortised cost (see Note 2d.5) using the effective interest  method.  While  financial  assets  measured at  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income are measured at fair value.\n\nSubsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities are  measured  at  amortised  cost  (see  Note  2d.5) using the effective interest method.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## 2.

Pengukuran biaya perolehan diamortisasi\n\n(lanjutan)\n\nSuku bunga efektif adalah suku bunga yang secara tepat  mendiskontokan  estimasi  pembayaran  dan penerimaan kas di masa datang selama perkiraan umur  dari  aset  keuangan  atau  liabilitas  keuangan (atau, jika lebih tepat, digunakan periode yang lebih singkat)  untuk  memperoleh  nilai  tercatat  dari  aset keuangan atau liabilitas keuangan. Pada saat menghitung suku bunga efektif, Perseroan mengestimasi  arus  kas  di  masa  datang  dengan mempertimbangkan seluruh persyaratan kontraktual  dalam      instrumen  keuangan  tersebut, tetapi  tidak  mempertimbangkan  kerugian  di  masa mendatang.\n\nPerhitungan suku bunga efektif mencakup seluruh fees dan costs yang diterima atau dibayarkan yang merupakan bagian tak terpisahkan dari suku bunga efektif, termasuk biaya transaksi.\n\nThe calculation of the effective interest rate includes  all  fees  and  costs  received  or  paid  that are  an  integral  part  of  the  effective  interest  rate, including transaction costs.\n\n## d.6. Pengukuran nilai wajar\n\n## d.6.  Fair value measurement\n\nNilai  wajar  adalah harga  yang akan  diterima untuk menjual  suatu  aset  atau  harga  yang  akan  dibayar untuk  mengalihkan  suatu  liabilitas  dalam  transaksi teratur ( orderly  transaction ) antara  pelaku  pasar ( market  participants )  pada  tanggal  pengukuran  di pasar utama atau, jika tidak terdapat pasar utama, di pasar yang paling menguntungkan dimana Perseroan  memiliki  akses  pada  tanggal  tersebut. Nilai wajar liabilitas mencerminkan risiko wanprestasinya.\n\nJika tersedia, Perseroan mengukur nilai wajar instrumen  keuangan  dengan  menggunakan  harga kuotasi  di  pasar  aktif  untuk  instrumen  tersebut. Suatu pasar dianggap aktif jika harga kuotasi sewaktu-waktu  dan  secara  berkala  tersedia  dan mencerminkan  transaksi  pasar  yang  aktual  dan rutin dalam suatu transaksi yang wajar.\n\nWhen  available,  the  Company  measures  the  fair value  of  an  instrument  using  quoted  prices  in  an active  market  for  that  instrument.  A  market  is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available and represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm's length basis.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between  market  participants  at the measurement date in the principal market or, in its absence, the most advantageous market to which the  Company  has  access  at  that  date.  The  fair value of a liability reflects its non-performance risk.\n\n## d.5.  Amortised cost measurement (continued)\n\nThe  effective  interest  rate  is  the  rate  that  exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments and receipts  through  the  expected  life  of  the  financial asset or financial liability (or, where appropriate, a shorter period) to the carrying amount  of  the financial asset or financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates future cash flows considering all contractual  terms  of  the  financial  instrument,  but not future credit losses.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## 2.

Financial assets and liabilities (continued)\n\n## d.6. Pengukuran nilai wajar (lanjutan)\n\n## d.6.  Fair value measurement (continued)\n\nJika  pasar  untuk  suatu  instrumen  keuangan  tidak aktif, Perseroan  menentukan  nilai  wajar  dengan menggunakan  teknik  penilaian.  Teknik  penilaian mencakup penggunaan transaksi pasar terkini yang dilakukan secara wajar oleh pihak-pihak yang memahami, berkeinginan, dan jika tersedia, referensi  atas nilai  wajar  terkini  dari  instrumen  lain yang secara substansial sama, penggunaan analisa arus  kas  yang  didiskonto  dan  penggunaan  model penetapan harga opsi ( option pricing model ). Teknik penilaian yang dipilih memaksimalkan penggunaan input pasar, dan meminimalkan penggunaan taksiran yang bersifat spesifik dari Perseroan, memasukkan semua faktor yang akan dipertimbangkan  oleh  para  pelaku  pasar dalam menetapkan  suatu  harga  dan  konsisten  dengan metodologi ekonomi yang diterima dalam penetapan  harga  instrumen  keuangan.  Input  yang digunakan dalam teknik penilaian secara memadai mencerminkan  ekspektasi  pasar  dan  ukuran  atas faktor  risiko  dan  pengembalian  ( risk-return ) yang melekat pada instrumen keuangan. Perseroan mengkalibrasi teknik penilaian dan menguji validitasnya dengan menggunakan harga-harga dari transaksi pasar terkini yang dapat diobservasi untuk instrumen  yang  sama  atau  atas  dasar  data  pasar lainnya yang tersedia yang dapat diobservasi.\n\nIf a market for a financial instrument is not active, the Company establishes fair value using a valuation technique. Valuation techniques include using recent arm's length transactions between knowledgeable and willing parties, and if available,  reference  to  the  current  fair  value  of other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flows analysis and option pricing models.  The  chosen  valuation  technique  makes maximum use of market  inputs,  relies  as  little  as possible  on  estimates  specific  to  the  Company, incorporates  all  factors  that  market  participants would consider in setting a price, and is consistent with accepted economic methodologies for pricing financial instruments. Inputs to valuation techniques reasonably represent market expectations and measures of the risk-return factors  inherent  in  the  financial  instrument.  The Company calibrates valuation techniques and tests them  for  validity using  prices  from  observable current market transactions in the same instrument or  based  on  other  available  observable  market data.\n\nBukti  terbaik  atas  nilai  wajar  instrumen  keuangan pada saat pengakuan awal adalah harga transaksi, yaitu  nilai  wajar  dari  pembayaran  yang  diberikan atau diterima, kecuali jika nilai wajar dari instrumen keuangan tersebut ditentukan dengan perbandingan dengan transaksi pasar terkini yang dapat diobservasi dari suatu instrumen yang sama (yaitu  tanpa  modifikasi  atau  pengemasan  ulang), atau berdasarkan suatu teknik penilaian yang variabelnya  hanya  menggunakan  data  dari  pasar yang dapat diobservasi. Jika harga transaksi memberikan bukti terbaik atas nilai wajar pada saat pengakuan awal, maka instrumen keuangan pada awalnya  diukur  pada  harga  transaksi  dan  selisih antara harga transaksi dan nilai yang sebelumnya diperoleh dari model penilaian diakui dalam laporan laba rugi setelah pengakuan awal tergantung pada masing-masing fakta dan keadaaan dari transaksi tersebut namun tidak lebih lambat dari saat penilaian tersebut didukung sepenuhnya oleh data pasar  yang  dapat  diobservasi  atau  saat  transaksi ditutup.\n\nThe  best  evidence  of  the  fair  value  of  a  financial instrument  at  initial  recognition  is  the  transaction price,  i.e.,  the  fair  value  of  the  consideration  given or received, unless the fair value of that instrument is evidenced by comparison with the other observable current market transactions in the same instrument (i.e., without modification or repackaging),  or  based  on  a  valuation  technique whose variables include only data from observable markets. When transaction price provides the best evidence  of  fair  value  at  initial recognition,  the financial instrument is initially measured  at  the transaction  price  and  any  difference  between  this price and the value initially obtained from a valuation  model  is  subsequently  recognised  in  the statement of profit or loss depending on the individual facts and circumstances of the transaction but not later than when the valuation is supported wholly by observable market data or the transaction is closed out.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n33\n\n539",

Taksiran    nilai  wajar  yang  diperoleh  dari model penilaian akan disesuaikan untuk mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor lainnya, seperti risiko likuiditas atau ketidakpastian model penilaian, sepanjang Perseroan yakin bahwa keterlibatan suatu pasar pihak ketiga akan mempertimbangkan faktor-faktor tersebut dalam penetapan harga suatu transaksi.\n\nPerseroan  mengukur  nilai  wajar  untuk  instrumen keuangan  yang  diakui  pada  nilai  wajar  dengan menggunakan tingkat hirarki berikut ini:\n\n- -Tingkat  1:  Harga  kuotasi  di  pasar  yang  aktif untuk instrumen keuangan yang sejenis,\n- -Tingkat  2:  Teknik  penilaian  berdasarkan  input yang dapat diobservasi,\n- -Tingkat 3: Teknik penilaian menggunakan input signifikan yang tidak dapat diobservasi.\n\n## e.

Fair value estimates  obtained  from  models  are  adjusted  for any other factors, such as liquidity risk or valuation model uncertainties, to the extent that the Company believes  a  third-party  market  participation  would take them into account in pricing a transaction.\n\nThe  Company  measures  fair  value  for  financial instrument recognised at fair values using the following hierarchy level:\n\n- -Level 1: Quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument,\n- -Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs,\n- -Level 3: Valuation  techniques  using  significant unobservable inputs.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n34\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

Murabahah financing receivables (continued)\n\nDalam hal restrukturisasi piutang pembiayaan murabahah dilakukan dengan modifikasi persyaratan pembiayaan non substansial yang tidak menghasilkan penghentian pengakuan, Perseroan  memberikan  masa  cuti  angsuran  dan pengunduran jatuh tempo kepada konsumen namun tidak mengubah total sisa piutang pembiayaan murabahah (baik pokok maupun margin)  yang  harus  dibayarkan  oleh  konsumen. Perseroan mencatat dampak restrukturisasi tersebut secara prospektif, dengan tidak mengakui amortisasi  marjin  serta  amortisasi  biaya  perolehan pada saat cuti angsuran. Pendapatan marjin setelah  restrukturisasi  akan  diakui  sebesar  jumlah marjin yang ditentukan dalam persyaratan pembiayaan  baru  yang  tidak  mengubah  total  sisa piutang.\n\nIn  term  of  restructuring  of  murabahah  financing receivables through non substantial modification of financing terms which does not result in derecognition, the Company  provides  payment holiday  and  tenor  extention  to  the  consumer  but did not change the outstanding of murabahah financing  receivables  (both  principal  and  margin) that have  to be paid by the consumer. The Company  records  the  impact  from  restructuring prospectively,  by  not  recognising  the  amortisation of  margin  and  amortisation  of  acquisition  costs during  the  payment  holiday.  Margin  income  after restructuring will be  recognised at the margin amount  stated  under  the  new  financing  terms which did not change the outstanding receivables.\n\n## f.3.  Piutang  sewa  pembiayaan (Perseroan sebagai pesewa)\n\n## f.3.  Finance  lease  receivables (the Company as a lessor)\n\nPembiayaan sewa Perseroan meliputi piutang sewa pembiayaan - konvensional dan Ijarah Muntahiyah Bittamlik ('IMBT') - syariah.\n\nThe Company's lease financing consists of finance lease receivables -conventional and Ijarah Muntahiyah Bittamlik ('IMBT') - sharia.\n\n## Pembiayaan sewa - konvensional\n\n## Finance lease - conventional\n\nPenentuan  apakah  suatu  perjanjian merupakan perjanjian sewa atau perjanjian yang mengandung sewa  didasarkan  atas  substansi  perjanjian  pada tanggal awal sewa dan apakah pemenuhan perjanjian tergantung pada penggunaan suatu aset dan  perjanjian tersebut memberikan  suatu  hak untuk  menggunakan  aset  tersebut.  Suatu  sewa diklasifikasikan sebagai sewa pembiayaan jika sewa tersebut mengalihkan secara substansial seluruh  risiko  dan  manfaat  yang  terkait  dengan kepemilikan aset. Suatu sewa diklasifikasikan sebagai sewa operasi jika sewa tidak mengalihkan secara substansial seluruh risiko dan manfaat yang terkait dengan kepemilikan aset.\n\nThe determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement  at  inception  date  and  whether  the fulfillment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset and the arrangement conveys  a  right  to use  the  asset.  Leases  are classified  as  finance  leases  if  the  leases  transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets. Leases are classified  as  operating leases  if  the leases  do  not transfer substantially all the risks and  rewards incidental to ownership of the leased assets.\n\nPerseroan  mengakui  aset  berupa  piutang  sewa pembiayaan  sebesar  jumlah  yang  sama  dengan investasi sewa  neto.  Penerimaan  piutang  sewa diperlakukan sebagai pembayaran pokok dan penghasilan sewa pembiayaan. Pengakuan penghasilan  sewa  pembiayaan  didasarkan  pada suatu pola yang mencerminkan suatu tingkat pengembalian periodik yang konstan atas investasi neto.\n\nThe Company recognised assets of financial lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease. Lease payment is treated as repayment  of  principal  and  finance  lease  income. The  recognition  of  finance  lease  income  is  based on  a  pattern  reflecting  a  constant  periodic  rate  of return  on  the  Company's  net  investment  in  the finance lease.\n\nPiutang  sewa  pembiayaan  akan  dihapusbukukan setelah menunggak lebih dari 180 hari. Penerimaan dari piutang yang  telah dihapusbukukan  diakui sebagai pendapatan lain-lain pada saat diterima.\n\nFinance  lease  receivables  will  be  written-off  when they are overdue for more than 180 days.

Untuk  aset  ini, ECL 12 bulan akan dihitung.\n\nAset keuangan yang  dikategorikan  sebagai Stage 1  adalah  aset  keuangan  dengan  hari  tunggakan kurang atau sama dengan 30 hari.\n\nStage 2: mencakup aset keuangan yang mengalami peningkatan signifikan atas risiko kredit,  namun  tidak  memiliki  bukti  penurunan  nilai yang obyektif. Untuk aset ini, ECL lifetime dihitung.\n\nAset  keuangan  yang  dianggap  telah  mengalami peningkatan risiko kredit yang signifikan dan dikategorikan sebagai Stage 2 adalah aset keuangan dengan hari tunggakan dari 31-90 hari. Aset  keuangan  yang  telah  mengajukan  program restrukturisasi, juga dianggap telah mengalami peningkatan risiko kredit  yang  signifikan  sehingga akan dikategorikan minimal sebagai Stage 2 selama periode tertentu.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nThe Company considers that default has occurred when a financial asset is more than 90 days past due or has reasonable and supportable information that the credit has been impaired.\n\n## Staging Criteria\n\nFinancial assets have to be allocated to one of the three impairment stages (Stage 1, Stage 2, Stage 3) by determining whether a significant increase in credit  risk  has  occurred  on  financial  asset  since initial recognition or whether the facility is defaulted on the reporting date.\n\nStage  1:  includes  financial  assets  that  have  not had a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  or  that  have  low  credit  risk  at  the reporting  date.  For  these  assets,  12-month  ECL are recognized.\n\nFinancial assets categorised as Stage 1 is financial  assets  with  days  overdue  less  or  equal than 30 days.\n\nStage 2: includes financial assets that have had a significant  increase  in  credit  risk  but  do  not  have objective evidence of impairment. For these assets, lifetime ECL are recognized.\n\nFinancial assets considered to experience significant  increase  in  credit  risk  and  categorised as  Stage 2  is  financial  assets  with  days  overdue 31-90 days. Financial instrument that has proposed restructure program, will be considered to experience significant increase in credit risk, so will  be  categorised  minimum  as  Stage  2  during certain period.\n\nIn calculating ECL, Company considers time value of  money  to  calculate  present  value  of  ECL  from expected default date to reporting date.\n\n## 12 Months &amp; Lifetime ECL\n\n12-month ECL is the ECL that result from default events on a financial  aset  within  12  months  after the reporting date  (or a shorter period if the expected lifetime of the financial asset is less than 12 months).\n\n## 2.

This stage consist of obligors that has already  impaired  (defaulted)  or  financial  assets with days overdue more than 90 days.\n\nFaktor utama  dalam  menentukan  apakah  aset keuangan  memerlukan  ECL  12  bulan  ( Stage 1) atau ECL lifetime ( Stage 2) disebut dengan kriteria Peningkatan Signifikan dalam Risiko Kredit (SICR). Penentuan  kriteria  peningkatan  risiko  kredit  yang signifikan  (SICR)  memerlukan  pengkajian  apakah telah terjadi peningkatan risiko kredit yang signifikan pada tanggal pelaporan.\n\nThe key factor in determining whether a financial assets needs 12-month (Stage 1) or lifetime ECL (Stage  2)  is  called  by  the  criteria  of  Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR). Determining significant  increase  in  credit  risk  (SICR)  criteria involves assessment of whether there has been a significant increase in credit risk at reporting date.\n\nSemua konsumen yang terkena dampak COVID-19  sudah  membayar  angsuran  kembali secara  normal  dan  penentuan stage berdasarkan hari tunggak konsumen.\n\nInstallment payments of all customers affected by COVID-19  have  been  back  to  normal  and  stage determination is based  on  consumer  overdue days.\n\nPSAK 71 mensyaratkan penyertaan informasi tentang  kejadian  masa  lalu,  kondisi  saat  ini  dan perkiraan kondisi ekonomi masa depan. Perkiraan perubahan dalam kerugian kredit yang diharapkan harus mencerminkan, dan secara langsung konsisten  dengan,  perubahan  dalam  data  terkait yang diobservasi dari periode ke periode. Perhitungan ECL ini membutuhkan estimasi forward  looking  dari Probability  of  Default (PD), Loss  Given  Default (LGD), Exposure  At  Default (EAD), dan Macro-Economic Variables (MEV).\n\nSFAS  71  requires  inclusion  of  information  about past  events,  current  conditions  and  forecasts  of future economic conditions. The estimates of changes  in  expected  credit  losses  should  reflect, and  be  directionally  consistent  with,  changes  in related observable data from period to period. The calculation of ECL requires estimation of forwardlooking  Probability  of  Default  (PD),  Loss  Given Default  (LGD),  Exposure  At  Default  (EAD)  and Macro-Economic Variables (MEV).\n\n## Probability of Default (PD)\n\n## Probability of Default (PD)\n\nAdalah  probabilitas  konsumen  mengalami  gagal bayar  dimana  terjadi  pada  suatu  waktu  tertentu. PD yang digunakan di dalam PSAK 71 adalah PD point in time yang  menggambarkan  PD  yang terjadi pada  suatu  kondisi  ekonomi.  PD  yang dihitung  sampai  dengan  periode  12  bulan  dari tanggal  laporan  (PD  12  bulan)  digunakan  untuk perhitungan  ECL  dari  aset  yang  dikategorikan Stage 1,  sementara  PD yang dihitung sepanjang umur aset (PD lifetime ) digunakan untuk perhitungan  ECL  dari  aset  yang  dikategorikan Stage 2 dan 3.\n\nIs  the  probability  that  a  consumer  will  default  in which happened at certain time. PD used in SFAS 71  is  point  in  time  PD  which  represent  PD  at  a certain  economy  condition.  PD  is  calculated  until next 12 months after reporting period  (12 months PD), is used to calculate ECL from assets categorised as Stage 1, while PD  calculated during the lifetime of assets (Lifetime PD), is used to calculate ECL from assets categorised as Stage 2 and 3.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n39\n\n545",

Perseroan  mengestimasikan  LGD  berdasarkan data  historis  dari  tingkat  pemulihan  dari  akun yang gagal bayar selama periode observasi dengan  memperhitungkan  tingkat  pembayaran yang diterima serta pemulihan yang berasal dari jaminan terhadap aset keuangan dengan mempertimbangkan  asumsi  ekonomi  di masa depan (jika relevan).\n\n## Exposure At Default (EAD)\n\n## Exposure At Default (EAD)\n\nPerkiraan nilai buku pada saat gagal bayar dengan  mempertimbangkan  profil  arus  kas  aset keuangan  selama  umur  aset  keuangan.

This  incorporates  the  impact  of repayments, both principal and interest.\n\n## Macro-Economic Variables (MEV)\n\n## Macro-Economic Variables (MEV)\n\nMEV  merupakan  salah  satu  komponen  utama dalam menentukan perkiraan  kondisi ekonomi di masa mendatang, dimana Perseroan melakukan evaluasi  secara  reguler.  Adapun  MEV,  seperti produk domestik bruto (PDB), tingkat inflasi, dan nilai  tukar  mata  uang  asing  digunakan  sebagai faktor  untuk  melakukan  penyesuaian  terhadap PD  dan  LGD  terkait  dampak  perubahan  kondisi ekonomi di masa mendatang, dimana MEV yang digunakan adalah berdasarkan beberapa skenario (normal, baik dan buruk) dan perhitungan ECL akan mempertimbangkan probabilitas yang ditetapkan untuk masingmasing skenario.\n\n## Pembiayaan murabahah dan IMBT\n\n## Murabahah financing and IMBT\n\nPada setiap tanggal pelaporan, Perseroan mengevaluasi apakah terdapat bukti  objektif telah terjadinya penurunan  nilai  atas  aset keuangan Perseroan.  Aset keuangan  mengalami penurunan nilai jika bukti objektif menunjukkan bahwa peristiwa yang  merugikan  telah terjadi setelah pengakuan  awal  aset  keuangan,  dan  peristiwa tersebut  berdampak  pada  arus  kas  masa  datang atas aset keuangan yang dapat diestimasi secara handal.\n\nAt  each  reporting  date,  the  Company  evaluates whether there is objective evidence that the Company's financial assets are impaired. Financial assets are impaired when objective evidence demonstrates that a loss event has occurred after the  initial  recognition  of  the  financial  assets,  and that  loss  event  has  an  impact  on  the  future  cash flows on the financial assets that can be estimated reliably.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nMEV is one of main component in determining the expected  economy  condition  in  the  future  and reviewed regularly by the Company. MEV such as gross domestic product (GDP), inflation rate, and exchange  rate  are  used  as  factor  to  perform adjustment  on  PD  and  LGD  related  to  impact  of change  of  economy  condition  in  the  future,  in which the MEV used is based on several scenarios (normal, good and bad) and ECL will be calculated by considering the probability assigned for each scenario.\n\nThe  loss  that  is expected  to  arise  on  default consumer,  incorporating  the  impact  of  relevant forward looking economic assumptions, which represents the difference between the contractual cash  flows  due  and  those  that  the  Company expects to receive. The Company estimates LGD based on the historical recovery of default consumer during observation period by considering the payment received and the recovery of any collateral of financial assets, taking into account forward looking economic assumptions (if relevant).\n\n- 2.

Dalam mengukur nilai pakai, estimasi  arus  kas  masa  depan  didiskontokan  ke nilai sekarang dengan menggunakan tingkat diskonto sebelum pajak yang mencerminkan penilaian pasar saat ini terhadap nilai kas kini dan risiko spesifik terhadap aset tersebut.\n\nThe  recoverable  amount  of  an  asset  or  cash generating unit is the greater of its value in use or its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows arediscounted to their  present  value  using  a  pretax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\n\n## i. Instrumen derivatif untuk tujuan manajemen risiko\n\nSeluruh  instrumen  derivatif yang  dimiliki Perseroan digunakan  untuk  tujuan  manajemen  risiko.  Instrumen derivatif ini digunakan  untuk  lindung  nilai  eksposur risiko  suku  bunga  dan  risiko  mata  uang  Perseroan. Instrumen derivatif untuk tujuan manajemen  risiko diukur pada nilai wajar dalam laporan posisi keuangan. Untuk  memenuhi  persyaratan  akuntansi  lindung  nilai, beberapa  kriteria  tertentu  harus  dipenuhi,  termasuk adanya dokumentasi formal pada awal lindung nilai dan dokumentasi  apakah  instrumen  lindung  nilai  tersebut efektif dalam saling hapus antara perubahan nilai wajar atau arus kas dari item lindung nilaian.\n\nAll  derivative  instruments held by the Company are for risk management purposes. These derivative instruments are used to hedge the Company's exposures to interest rate risk and currency risk. Derivative  instruments  held  for  risk  management  are measured  at  fair  value  in  the  statement  of  financial position. To qualify for hedge accounting, certain criteria are to be met, including formal documentation to be in place at the inception of the hedge also documentation whether the hedging instrument is effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.\n\nPada penetapan awal lindung nilai, Perseroan mendokumentasikan  secara  formal  hubungan  antara instrumen  lindung nilai  dan  unsur  yang  dilindung  nilai, termasuk  tujuan  manajemen  risiko  dan  strategi  dalam melaksanakan transaksi lindung nilai, bersamaan dengan  metode  yang  akan  digunakan  untuk  menilai efektivitas  hubungan  lindung  nilai.  Perseroan  menilai, pada  awal  hubungan  lindung  nilai  dan  juga  secara berkesinambungan, apakah instrumen lindung nilai diharapkan  akan  'sangat  efektif'  dalam  rangka  saling hapus atas perubahan nilai wajar atau perubahan arus kas  dari  unsur  yang  dilindung  nilai  sepanjang  periode dimana lindung nilai tersebut ditetapkan.\n\nOn  initial designation of the hedge,  the  Company formally documents the relationship between the hedging  instruments  and  hedged  items,  including  the risk management objective and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, together with the method that will be  used  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  hedging relationship. The Company makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as on an ongoing basis, whether the hedging instruments are expected to be 'highly effective' in offsetting the changes in the fair value or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated.\n\nBagian efektif dari perubahan nilai wajar derivatif diakui dalam penghasilan komprehensif lain. Keuntungan atau kerugian yang terkait dengan bagian yang tidak efektif diakui dalam laba rugi.\n\nThe  effective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  of derivatives is recognized in other comprehensive income.

Bagian efektif dari perubahan nilai wajar derivatif yang ditetapkan  sebagai  instrumen  lindung  nilai  atas  arus kas ditangguhkan pada pos (kerugian)/keuntungan kumulatif  atas  instrumen  derivatif  untuk  lindung  nilai arus kas, yang merupakan bagian dari ekuitas. Bagian yang tidak efektif diakui secara langsung pada laporan laba  rugi.  Jumlah  yang  ditangguhkan  dalam  ekuitas direklasifikasi ke dalam laporan laba rugi dalam periode yang sama  dimana  arus  kas yang dilindung nilai mempengaruhi  laba  atau  rugi,  dan  pada  pos  yang sama dalam laporan laba rugi.\n\nThe  Company  designates  derivative  as  the  hedging instruments of cash flows hedges where the instrument hedges  the  variability  in  cash  flows  attributable  to  a particular risk associated with a recognised liability that could  affect  profit or loss. The  effective  portion  of changes  in  the  fair  value  of  derivative  designated  as hedging instruments of cash flows hedges is deferred to the cumulative (losses)/gains on derivative instruments for cash flows hedges, which forms part of equity. Any ineffective  portion is recognised  immediately  in  the statement of profit  or loss.  Amounts deferred in equity are  reclassified  to  the  statement  of  profit  or  loss  as  a reclassification  adjustment  in  the  same  period  as  the hedged cash flows affect profit or loss, and in the same line item in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nKetika  instrumen  lindung  nilai  kadaluarsa  atau  dijual, dihentikan,  dilaksanakan,  atau  tidak  lagi  memenuhi kriteria akuntansi lindung nilai, keuntungan atau kerugian  kumulatif  yang  ditangguhkan di  ekuitas  tetap diakui  pada  pos  (kerugian)/keuntungan  kumulatif  atas instrumen  derivatif  untuk  lindung  nilai  arus  kas  dan direklasifikasi  ke  laporan  laba  rugi  ketika  unsur  yang dilindung nilai diakui dalam laporan laba rugi.\n\nWhen the hedging instrument expires or sold, terminated,  exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting,  the  cumulative  amount  deferred  in  equity remains  in  the  cumulative  (losses)/gains  on  derivative instruments for cash flows hedges, and is subsequently reclassified to the statement of profit or loss when the hedged item is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nKetika suatu prakiraan transaksi lindung nilai tidak lagi diharapkan  akan  terjadi, jumlah  yang  ditangguhkan dalam ekuitas diakui segera dalam laporan laba rugi.\n\n## j.

To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.\n\nKeuntungan  atau  kerugian  aktuarial  yang  timbul dari  penyesuaian  dan  perubahan  dalam  asumsiasumsi aktuarial langsung diakui seluruhnya melalui penghasilan atau beban komprehensif lainnya  pada  tahun dimana keuntungan/(kerugian) aktuarial terjadi.\n\nActuarial  gains  or  losses  arising  from  experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are directly fully recognised to other comprehensive income or expense in the year when such actuarial gains/(losses) occur.\n\nPerseroan telah memiliki program pensiun imbalan pasti  yang  mana  Perseroan  membayar  iuran  ke dana  pensiun  lembaga  keuangan  yang  dihitung berdasarkan  persentase  tertentu  dari  penghasilan tetap yang diterima karyawan yang sudah memenuhi kriteria yang ditetapkan Perseroan.\n\nThe Company also has a defined benefit pension program where the Company pays contributions to a financial institution pension plan which is calculated at a certain percentage of fixed income of employees who meet the Company's criteria.\n\n## o.3. Imbalan kerja jangka panjang lainnya\n\n## o.3. Other long-term employment benefits\n\nPerseroan memberikan imbalan kerja jangka panjang lainnya berupa tunjangan cuti besar yang ditentukan  sesuai  dengan  Peraturan  Perseroan. Tunjangan cuti besar diperkirakan tidak akan diselesaikan  seluruhnya  dalam  waktu  12  bulan setelah  tanggal  laporan  posisi  keuangan  dimana karyawan  memberikan  jasa  terkait.  Kewajiban  ini diukur sebagai nilai kini dari perkiraan pembayaran di masa  depan  yang  akan  dibuat  sehubungan dengan jasa yang diberikan oleh karyawan hingga akhir periode pelaporan dengan menggunakan metode Projected Unit Credit dan dihitung minimum satu tahun sekali oleh aktuaris independen.\n\nThe Company provides other long-term employment  benefits  in  the  form  of  long  service leave  award  which  is  determined  in  compliance with  the  Company's  Regulation.  The  long  service leave award are not expected to be settled wholly within  12  months  after  the  statement  of  financial position  date  in  which  the  employees  render  the related service. These obligations are measured as the present value of future payments to be made in respect  of  services  provided  by  employees  up  to the end of the reporting period using Projected Unit Credit method and are calculated minimum once a year by an independent actuary.\n\n## o.4. Pesangon pemutusan kontrak kerja\n\n## o.4. Termination benefits\n\nPesangon pemutusan kontrak kerja terutang ketika karyawan  dihentikan  kontrak  kerjanya  sebelum usia pensiun normal. Perseroan mengakui pesangon ketika Perseroan menunjukkan komitmennya  untuk  memutuskan  kontrak  kerja dengan karyawan berdasarkan suatu rencana formal terperinci yang kecil kemungkinannya untuk dibatalkan. Pesangon yang akan dibayarkan dalam  waktu  lebih  dari  12  bulan  setelah  tanggal laporan posisi keuangan didiskontokan untuk mencerminkan nilai kini.\n\nTermination benefits are payable when the employment of  an  employee  is  terminated  before the normal retirement age. The Company recognises termination benefits when it demonstrates  its commitment  to  terminate  the employment of employees according to a detailed formal plan and the possibility to withdraw the plan is remote. Benefits falling due  more  than 12 months  after  the  statement  of  financial  position date are discounted to reflect its present value.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n## o.2.

Bonds payable\n\nObligasi  yang  diterbitkan  dicatat  sebesar  nilai  nominal dikurangi saldo diskonto yang belum diamortisasi. Biaya  emisi  sehubungan  dengan  penerbitan  obligasi diakui sebagai diskonto dan dikurangkan langsung dari hasil emisi untuk menentukan hasil emisi neto obligasi yang diterbitkan tersebut.\n\nBonds  issued  are  presented  at  nominal  value  net  of unamortised  discounts.  Issuance  costs  in  connection with  the  bonds  issuance  are  recognised  as  discounts and  directly  deducted  from  the  proceeds  of  bonds issuance  to  determine  the  net  proceeds  of  the  bonds issued.\n\nUtang obligasi diukur pada biaya perolehan diamortisasi dengan menggunakan metode suku bunga efektif setelah pengakuan awalnya. Diskonto diamortisasi selama  jangka  waktu  obligasi tersebut dengan menggunakan metode suku bunga efektif (lihat Catatan 2n.1).\n\nBonds payable issued are measured at amortised cost using  effective  interest  method  after  initial  recognition. The  discounts  are  amortised  over  the  period  of  the bonds  using  the  effective  interest  method  (see  Note 2n.1).\n\n## q.   Perpajakan\n\n## q. Taxation\n\nBeban  pajak  terdiri  dari  beban  pajak  kini  dan  beban pajak tangguhan. Beban pajak diakui pada laporan laba rugi kecuali untuk bagian yang  langsung  diakui di komponen  ekuitas  lainnya,  dimana  beban  pajak  yang terkait  dengan  bagian  tersebut  diakui  di  penghasilan komprehensif lain.\n\nIncome tax expense comprises of current and deferred tax. Income tax expense is recognised in the statement of profit  or  loss  except  to  the  extent it relates  to  items recognised directly in other equity components, in which case it is recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nBeban pajak kini  adalah  hutang  pajak  yang  ditentukan berdasarkan laba kena pajak untuk tahun yang bersangkutan  yang  dihitung berdasarkan  tarif pajak yang berlaku atau yang secara substansial telah berlaku pada tanggal pelaporan.\n\nPerseroan menerapkan metode aset dan liabilitas dalam menghitung  beban  pajaknya.  Dengan  metode  ini,  aset dan  liabilitas pajak  tangguhan  diakui  setiap  tanggal pelaporan sebesar perbedaan temporer aset dan liabilitas untuk tujuan akuntansi dan tujuan pajak. Metode  ini juga mengharuskan  pengakuan  manfaat pajak  di  masa  akan  datang,  seperti  kompensasi  rugi fiskal,  jika  kemungkinan  realisasi  manfaat  tersebut  di masa  mendatang  cukup  besar  ( probable ).  Tarif  pajak yang berlaku atau yang secara substansial telah berlaku pada tahun realisasi aset dan liabilitas pajak tangguhan, digunakan dalam menentukan pajak penghasilan tangguhan.\n\nThe Company adopts the asset and liability method in determining its income tax expense. Under this method, deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  recognised  at each reporting date for temporary differences between the  accounting  and  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits, such as tax loss carry forwards, to the extent that  realisation  of  such  benefits  is  probable.  Currently enacted or substantially enacted tax rates at the year of deferred tax assets or liabilities realised, are used in the determination of deferred income tax.\n\nAset pajak tangguhan diakui apabila terdapat kemungkinan  besar  bahwa  jumlah  laba  fiskal  pada masa  datang  akan  memadai  untuk  mengkompensasi perbedaan temporer yang menimbulkan  aset pajak tangguhan tersebut.\n\nManajemen  secara  periodik  mengevaluasi  posisi  yang dilaporkan di Surat Pemberitahuan (SPT) Tahunan sehubungan dengan situasi di mana aturan pajak yang berlaku membutuhkan interpretasi. Jika perlu, manajemen  menentukan  provisi  berdasarkan  jumlah yang diharapkan akan dibayar kepada otoritas pajak.\n\nManagement  periodically  evaluates  positions  taken  in annual  tax  return  with  respect  to  situations  in  which applicable  tax  regulation  is  subject  to  interpretation. Management  establishes  provisions  where  appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nDeferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to compensate the temporary differences which resulted in such deferred tax assets.\n\nCurrent tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the current year which is calculated using  tax  rates  enacted  or  substantively  enacted  at reporting date.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## 2.

A contract is, or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\n\nUntuk  menilai  apakah  kontrak  memberikan  hak  untuk mengendalikan penggunaan aset identifikasian, Perseroan harus menilai apakah:\n\nTo  assess  whether  a  contract  conveys  the  right  to control  the  use  of  an  identified  asset,  the  Company shall assess whether:\n\n- -Perseroan memiliki hak untuk mendapatkan secara substansial seluruh manfaat ekonomi dari penggunaan aset identifikasian; dan\n- -The Company has the right to substantially obtain all economic benefit from use of the indentified asset; and\n- -Perseroan memiliki hak untuk mengarahkan penggunaan aset identifikasian.\n- -The  Company has a  right  to  determine  the  use  of identified asset.\n\nPada  tanggal  permulaan  sewa,  Perseroan  mengakui aset  hak  guna  dan  liabilitas  sewa.

At initial recognition, the right-of-use asset is measured at initial recognition  of lease  liability plus total lease payment that has been paid until  inception date.  The right-of-use asset is amortised using straight line method throughout the lease term and recognised as general and administrative expense.\n\nLiabilitas sewa diukur sebesar nilai kini estimasi biaya sewa yang masih harus dibayar oleh Perseroan kepada pesewa yang didiskontokan dengan menggunakan suku  bunga  obligasi  seri  terbaru  saat  insepsi  sewa dengan tenor yang paling  mendekati  masa sewa aset pendasar.

PENGGUNAAN ESTIMASI DAN PERTIMBANGAN\n\n## 3. USE OF ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS\n\nPengungkapan ini merupakan tambahan atas pembahasan tentang manajemen risiko keuangan (lihat Catatan 37).\n\nThese disclosures supplement the financial risk management disclosures (see Note 37).\n\n## a. Sumber utama ketidakpastian estimasi\n\n## a. Key sources of estimation uncertainty\n\n## a.1. Cadangan kerugian penurunan nilai aset keuangan\n\n## a.1.  Allowance  for  impairment  losses  on  financial assets\n\nEvaluasi atas kerugian penurunan nilai aset keuangan berupa piutang pembiayaan konsumen, piutang pembiayaan murabahah dan piutang sewa pembiayaan dijelaskan di Catatan 2h.1.\n\nEvaluation for impairment on financial assets which are  consumer  financing  receivables,  murabahah financing receivables and finance lease receivabes are described in Note 2h.1.\n\n## a.2.   Penentuan nilai wajar\n\n## a.2.  Determining fair values\n\nDalam menentukan nilai wajar atas aset keuangan dan  liabilitas keuangan  dimana  tidak  terdapat harga  pasar  yang  dapat  diobservasi,    Perseroan menggunakan  teknik  penilaian  seperti  dijelaskan pada  Catatan  2d.6.  Untuk  instrumen  keuangan yang  jarang  diperdagangkan  dan  tidak  memiliki harga  yang  transparan,  nilai  wajarnya  menjadi kurang objektif dan karenanya, membutuhkan tingkat  pertimbangan  ( judgment )  yang  beragam, tergantung pada likuiditas, konsentrasi, ketidakpastian  faktor  pasar,  asumsi  penentuan harga dan risiko lainnya yang mempengaruhi instrumen tertentu.\n\n## a.3.     Pensiun\n\n## a.3.  Pension\n\nProgram-program pensiun ditentukan berdasarkan  perhitungan  aktuarial.  Perhitungan aktuarial menggunakan  asumsi-asumsi seperti tingkat diskonto, tingkat pengembalian aset, tingkat  kenaikan  penghasilan,  tingkat  kematian, tingkat pengunduran diri, dan lain-lain.\n\nPension programs are determined based on actuarial valuation. The actuarial valuation involves assumptions such as discount rate,  expected rate of  returns  on  plan  assets,  salary  increase  rate, mortality rate, resignation rate, and others.\n\n## b. Pertimbangan akuntansi yang penting dalam menetapkan kebijakan akuntansi Perseroan\n\n## b.  Critical accounting judgments in applying the Company's accounting policies\n\nPertimbangan akuntansi yang penting dalam menetapkan  kebijakan  akuntansi  Perseroan  meliputi penilaian instrumen keuangan.\n\nCritical accounting  judgments  made  in  applying  the Company's  accounting policies include valuation of financial instruments.\n\nKebijakan  akuntansi  Perseroan  untuk  pengukuran  nilai wajar dibahas di Catatan 2d.6.\n\nThe Company's accounting policy on fair value measurements is discussed in Note 2d.6.\n\nPerseroan mengukur nilai wajar dengan menggunakan hirarki dari metode berikut ini:\n\nThe Company measures fair values using the following hierarchy of methods:\n\n- \u00b7 Tingkat 1\n\nHarga kuotasi di pasar yang aktif untuk  instrumen keuangan yang sejenis.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n- \u00b7 Level 1 for\n\nQuoted market price in an active market an identical instrument.\n\nIn determining the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities for which there is no observable market  price,  the  Company  uses  the  valuation techniques as described in Note 2d.6. For financial instruments  that  are  traded  infrequently  and  have less price transparency, the fair value is less objective, and requires varying degrees of judgment depending on liquidity, concentration, uncertainty  of  market  factors,  pricing  assumptions and other risks affecting the specific instrument.\n\n53\n\n559",

Termasuk  dalam  kategori  ini  adalah instrumen keuangan yang dinilai dengan menggunakan  harga  kuotasi  di  pasar  aktif  untuk instrumen yang serupa; harga kuotasi untuk instrumen  keuangan  yang  serupa  di  pasar  yang kurang  aktif;  atau  teknik  penilaian  lainnya  dimana seluruh input signifikan yang digunakan dapat diobservasi secara langsung ataupun tidak langsung dari data yang tersedia di pasar.\n\n## \u00b7 Tingkat 3\n\nTeknik penilaian yang menggunakan input signifikan  yang  tidak  dapat  diobservasi.  Termasuk dalam kategori ini adalah semua instrumen keuangan dimana teknik penilaiannya menggunakan  input  yang  bukan  merupakan  data yang dapat diobservasi dan input yang tidak dapat diobservasi tersebut dapat memiliki dampak signifikan  terhadap  penilaian  instrumen  keuangan. Termasuk dalam kategori ini adalah instrumen yang dinilai  berdasarkan  harga  kuotasi  untuk  instrumen yang sejenis dimana terdapat penyesuaian signifikan yang tidak dapat diobservasi atau asumsi-asumsi yang diperlukan untuk mencerminkan  selisih  antara  instrumen  keuangan yang diperbandingkan.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n- \u00b7 Level 2\n\nValuation  techniques  based  on  observable  inputs. This category includes instruments valued using quoted  market  prices  in  active  markets  for  similar instruments;  quoted  prices  for  similar  instruments  in markets that are considered less than active; or other valuation  techniques  where  all  significant  inputs  are directly or indirectly observable from market data.\n\n## \u00b7 Level 3\n\nValuation  techniques  using  significant  unobservable inputs.  This  category  includes  all  instruments  where the valuation technique includes inputs not based on observable  data  and  the  unobservable  inputs  could have a significant effect on the instrument's valuation. This  category  includes  instruments  that  are  valued based on quoted prices for similar instruments where significant unobservable adjustments or assumptions are required to reflect differences between the instruments.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n## 3.

 pada  perubahan  atas  satu asumsi aktuarial dimana asumsi lainnya dianggap konstan. Dalam  prakteknya,  hal  ini  jarang  terjadi  dan  perubahan beberapa asumsi mungkin saling berkorelasi. Dalam perhitungan sensitivitas kewajiban imbalan pasti atas asumsi  aktuarial  utama,  metode  yang  sama  (perhitungan nilai  kini  kewajiban  imbalan  pasti  dengan  menggunakan metode Projected Unit Credit di akhir tahun) telah diterapkan  seperti  dalam  perhitungan  kewajiban  pensiun yang diakui dalam laporan posisi keuangan.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  are  based  on  a  change  in  an assumption  while  holding  all  other  assumptions  constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  to  significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the Projected Unit Credit method at the end of year) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statements of financial position.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n95\n\n601",

Dalam  prakteknya,  hal  ini  jarang  terjadi  dan  perubahan beberapa asumsi mungkin saling berkorelasi. Dalam perhitungan sensitivitas kewajiban imbalan pasti atas asumsi aktuarial  utama,  metode  yang  sama  (perhitungan  nilai  kini kewajiban imbalan pasti dengan menggunakan  metode Projected Unit Credit di akhir tahun) telah diterapkan seperti dalam  penghitungan  kewajiban  pensiun  yang  diakui  dalam laporan posisi keuangan.\n\nThe  sensitivity  analysis  are  based  on  a  change  in  an assumption while holding  all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity  of  the  defined  benefit  obligation  to  significant actuarial assumptions, the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the Projected Unit Credit method at the end of year) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statements of financial position.\n\nAnalisis  jatuh  tempo  yang  diharapkan  dari  imbalan  kerja jangka panjang lainnya yang tidak terdiskonto adalah sebagai berikut:\n\nExpected  maturity  analysis  of  undiscounted  other  longterm employment benefits are as follows:\n\n|                         |   2023 - |   2022 - |                      |\n|-------------------------|----------|----------|----------------------|\n| Dalam waktu 10 tahun    |   75.53  |   67.636 | Within next 10 years |\n| Dalam waktu 10-20 tahun |   53.068 |   42.985 | Within 10-20 years   |\n| Dalam waktu 20-30 tahun |    8.472 |    4.989 | Within 20-30 years   |\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n## Other long-term employment benefits (continued)\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n97\n\n603",

The Company has a mechanism that is based upon 4 (four) risk management pillars,which could be described as follows:\n\n## Pilar 1: Pengawasan Aktif Dewan Komisaris dan Direksi\n\nPengawasan  aktif  tersebut  tercermin  sejak  perencanaan bisnis tahunan, yang mencakup:\n\nActive supervision is reflected since the planning of annual business plan, which includes:\n\n- \u00b7 Menyetujui dan melakukan evaluasi kebijakan manajemen risiko secara berkala;\n- \u00b7 Melakukan evaluasi dan menyetujui aktivitas yang memerlukan  persetujuan  dari  Dewan  Komisaris  atau Direksi;\n- \u00b7 Menetapkan  kebijakan  dan  strategi  manajemen  risiko termasuk  penetapan  otoritas  dalam  pemberian  batasan serta tinjauan atas kualitas portofolio secara berkala;\n- \u00b7 Terdapatnya Komite Audit dan Komite  Pemantau Risiko sebagai  organ  Dewan  Komisaris  dalam  melaksanakan fungsi pengawasannya; dan\n- \u00b7 Membentuk komite yang terkait dengan penerapan manajemen risiko, yaitu Komite Manajemen Risiko.\n\nKerangka konsolidasi manajemen risiko dengan Perusahaan  Induk  dibentuk  dengan  menempatkan  wakil dari  Perusahaan  Induk  dalam  jajaran  Dewan  Komisaris Perseroan.  Kerangka  tersebut  juga  dilaksanakan  melalui pemeriksaan kinerja secara berkala oleh Perusahaan Induk terhadap Perseroan, menyangkut kinerja keuangan, pengawasan sistem informasi akuntansi, serta tingkat kesehatan dan profil risiko dari piutang pembiayaan.\n\nThe consolidated risk management framework with Parent Company  is  established  through  placing  representatives from Parent Company in the Board of Commissioners. The framework is also implemented through regular performance  assessment  by  the  Parent  Company  on  the Company, concerning the financial performance, monitoring on  accounting  information  system,  as  well  as  the  level  of soundness  and  risk  profile  of  the  Company's  financing receivables.\n\n## Pilar 2: Kecukupan Kebijakan dan Prosedur Manajemen Risiko serta Penetapan Limit Manajemen Risiko\n\n## Pillar 2: Risk Management Policy and Procedures, and Limit Setup\n\nPerseroan menyusun kebijakan-kebijakan terkait manajemen risiko yang diperiksa secara berkala dan selalu disesuaikan dengan keadaan usaha terkini.

The  Company  also  has  policies  regarding  limitation  on approval/authorisation for both credit and non-credit transactions.\n\nKerangka konsolidasi manajemen risiko dengan Perusahaan Induk terselenggara mengingat Perseroan mendapatkan  persetujuan  dari  Perusahaan  Induk  untuk pengajuan batasan baru maupun atas program kredit untuk produk baru (jika ada). Kebijakan cadangan kerugian penurunan nilai piutang Perseroan juga mengikuti kebijakan penyisihan pada Perusahaan Induk yang sejalan dan patuh terhadap Standar Akuntansi Keuangan di Indonesia.\n\nThe consolidated risk management framework with Parent Company is established as the Company obtains approval from Parent Company for proposal of new limits and for new product  credit  programs  (if  any).  The  Company's  policy  in relation with allowance for impairment losses on receivables should also follow the Parent Company's policy, which is in line and in compliance with Indonesian Financial Accounting Standards.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\n- \u00b7 Approving and evaluating risk management policies on a regular basis;\n- \u00b7 Evaluating and approving activities that require approval from the Board of Commissioners or Board of Directors;\n- \u00b7 Establishing risk  management policies and strategies, which  include  determining  the  authorisation  in  limits and reviewing the quality of portfolio on a regular basis;\n- \u00b7 The presence of the Audit Committee and Risk Monitoring  Committee  as  an  organ  of  the  Board  of Commissioners in carrying out their supervisory functions; and\n- \u00b7 Establishing committees in relation to the implementation  of risk management,  i.e.  the Risk Management Committee.\n\n## Pillar 1: Active Supervision by Boards of Commissioners and Directors\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n107\n\n613",

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n## (continued)\n\nRisiko pasar (lanjutan)\n\nMarket risk (continued)\n\n## Analisis sensitivitas\n\n## Sensitivity analysis\n\nManajemen risiko tingkat suku bunga terhadap limit perubahan tingkat suku bunga dilengkapi dengan pemantauan  atas  sensitivitas  aset  dan  liabilitas  keuangan Perseroan  terhadap  beberapa  skenario  suku  bunga  baku maupun  non-baku.  Skenario  baku  yang  dilakukan  setiap bulan  mencakup  analisis  kenaikan  atau  penurunan  kurva imbal hasil sebesar 100 basis poin (bp).\n\nThe management of interest rate risk  against  interest  rate gap limits is supplemented by monitoring the sensitivity of the  Company's  financial  assets  and  liabilities  to  various standard and non-standard interest rate scenarios. Standard scenarios that are considered on a monthly basis include a 100 basis point (bp) parallel rise or fall in all yield curves.\n\nTabel  berikut  menunjukkan  sensitivitas  atas  kemungkinan perubahan tingkat suku bunga pasar, dengan variabel lain dianggap konstan, terhadap pendapatan pembiayaan neto:\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in market interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the net financing income:\n\nTabel  berikut  menunjukkan  sensitivitas  atas  kemungkinan perubahan tingkat suku bunga pasar, dengan variabel lain dianggap konstan, terhadap beban bunga dan keuangan:\n\n|                                           | 2023 -    | 2022 -    |                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Kenaikan suku bunga dalam 100 basis poin  | 260.157   | 211.627   | Increase in interest rate in 100 basis point |\n| Penurunan suku bunga dalam 100 basis poin | (260.157) | (211.627) | Decrease in interest rate in 100 basis point |\n\nThe following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in market interest rates, with all  other  variables  held  constant,  of  the  interest  expense and financing charges:\n\n|                                           | 2023 -    | 2022 -   |                                              |\n|-------------------------------------------|-----------|----------|----------------------------------------------|\n| Kenaikan suku bunga dalam 100 basis poin  | 142.149   | 89.733   | Increase in interest rate in 100 basis point |\n| Penurunan suku bunga dalam 100 basis poin | (142.149) | (89.733) | Decrease in interest rate in 100 basis point |\n\n## Risiko kredit\n\n## Credit risk\n\nRisiko  kredit  merupakan  risiko  utama  karena  Perseroan bergerak  dalam  bidang  pembiayaan  konsumen,  dimana Perseroan  menawarkan  kredit  kepada  masyarakat  yang hendak memiliki kendaraan bermotor, barang durable , maupun alat berat. Secara langsung, Perseroan menghadapi  risiko seandainya  konsumen  tidak  mampu memenuhi  kewajibannya dalam melunasi kredit sesuai dengan  perjanjian  yang  telah  disepakati  antara  konsumen dengan Perseroan.\n\nPerseroan secara berkala melakukan identifikasi dan pengukuran risiko kredit berdasarkan indikator-indikator yang relevan terhadap Perseroan serta selalu mengembangkan indikator pengukuran risiko kredit sehingga risiko kredit dapat terukur lebih tajam dan akurat. Perseroan juga senantiasa memantau penerapan kebijakan kredit  yang  berlaku  dan  melakukan  perubahan-perubahan yang diperlukan, sesuai dengan kondisi yang sekarang dan akan  dihadapi  oleh  Perseroan.  Perseroan  telah  memiliki kebijakan dalam menghadapi risiko kredit, yakni dimulai dari proses  awal  penerimaan  aplikasi  kredit  yang  selektif  dan ditangani dengan prinsip kehati-hatian, yang mana aplikasi kredit  akan  melalui  proses  survei  dan  analisa  kredit  oleh Komite Kredit.\n\nThe  Company  periodically  performs  the  identification  and risk  measurement  of  credit  risk  based  on  the  indicators relevant to the Company and continuously develops indicators of measuring credit risk to ensure that credit risk can  be  measured  in  a  more  sharp  and  accurate  manner. The Company monitors the implementation of credit policies and  performs  adjustments  as  needed,  in  accordance  with current and future conditions to be faced by the Company. The  Company  has  a  policy  in  encountering  credit  risk, namely  starting  from  the  initial  receipt  of  credit  application which is handled with prudent principles, then going through survey and credit analysis processes by the Credit Committee.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nCredit risk is a major risk because the Company is engaged in  the  consumer  financing  activity,  in  which  the  Company offers credit to public who would like to own motor vehicle, durable goods, and heavy equipment. Directly, the Company faces  risks  when  consumers  are  not  able  to  fulfill  their obligations  in  paying  off  loans  already  agreed  upon  in  the contract between consumers and the Company.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n111\n\n617",

Analisis konsentrasi risiko kredit\n\n## ii. Concentration of credit risk analysis\n\nKonsentrasi risiko kredit timbul ketika sejumlah konsumen  bergerak  dalam  aktivitas  usaha  yang  sama atau  melakukan aktivitas  dalam  wilayah  geografis  yang sama,  atau  ketika  mereka  memiliki  karakteristik  yang sejenis yang  akan  menyebabkan  kemampuan  untuk memenuhi kewajiban kontraktualnya sama-sama dipengaruhi oleh perubahan kondisi ekonomi atau yang lainnya.\n\nPerseroan bergerak di bidang usaha pembiayaan konsumen yang pelanggannya kebanyakan adalah individu dan tidak terkonsentrasi pada wilayah geografis tertentu.\n\nThe Company  is currently engaged in consumer financing  business  which  the  consumers  are  mainly individuals and they are not concentrated in any specific geographic region.\n\nThe  following  table  sets  out  the  total  credit  risk  and  risk concentration of consumer financing receivables, murabahah financing receivables and finance lease receivables of the Company:\n\nTabel  berikut menggambarkan  jumlah  risiko  kredit  dan konsentrasi risiko atas piutang pembiayaan  konsumen, piutang pembiayaan murabahah dan piutang sewa pembiayaan yang dimiliki Perseroan:\n\n|                                     | 2023 -       | 2022 -       |                                       |\n|-------------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|\n| Piutang pembiayaan konsumen - neto  |              |              | Consumer financing receivables - net  |\n| Korporasi                           | 893.692      | 764.901      | Corporate                             |\n| Ritel                               | 19.786.937   | 16.439.820   | Retail                                |\n|                                     | 20.680.629 - | 17.204.721 - |                                       |\n| Piutang pembiayaan murabahah - neto |              |              | Murabahah financing receivables - net |\n| Korporasi                           | 160.682      | 82.933       | Corporate                             |\n| Ritel                               | 5.359.380    | 3.950.424    | Retail                                |\n|                                     | 5.520.062 -  | 4.033.357 -  |                                       |\n| Piutang sewa pembiayaan - neto      |              |              | Finance leases receivables - net      |\n| Korporasi                           | 995.267      | 730.061      | Corporate                             |\n| Ritel                               | 449.033      | 187.944      | Retail                                |\n|                                     | 1.444.300 -  | 918.005 -    |                                       |\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nConcentrations  of  credit  risk  arise  when  a  number  of consumers are engaged in similar business activities or activities  within  the  same  geographic  region,  or  when they have similar characteristics that would cause their ability  to  meet  contractual  obligations  to  be  similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n112\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

restrukturisasi  COVID-19  yang  baru  dari  konsumen  dan semua  konsumen  sudah  membayar  angsuran  kembali secara normal sehingga jumlah piutang pembiayaan restrukturisasi menunjukkan trend penurunan. Jumlah piutang pembiayaan konsumen, piutang pembiayaan murabahah  dan  piutang  sewa  pembiayaan  yang  telah direstrukturisasi pada tanggal 31 Desember 2023 dan 2022 disajikan pada Catatan 5, 6 dan 7.\n\nAligning with the decline of COVID-19 cases and improving economic condition, there is no new COVID-19 restructuring applications from consumers and all consumers  have already paid the installment back to normal payment, so the financing receivables of restructured consumer has shown declining trend. The  amount  of  restructured consumer financing receivables, murabahah financing receivables and finance  lease  receivables  as  of  31  December  2023  and 2022 are presented in Notes 5, 6 and 7.\n\n## Risiko likuiditas\n\n## Liquidity risk\n\nRisiko  likuiditas  merupakan  risiko,  yang  mana  Perseroan tidak  memiliki  sumber  keuangan  yang  mencukupi  untuk memenuhi kewajibannya yang telah jatuh tempo dan untuk menjalankan usahanya.\n\nSumber pendanaan Perseroan berasal dari skema pembiayaan bersama dengan PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk; pinjaman dalam negeri, baik  dalam bentuk  pinjaman secara  langsung  dari  bank  dalam  negeri  maupun  melalui obligasi dan sukuk mudharabah serta pinjaman luar negeri.\n\nSelain  itu,  dalam  pengelolaan  risiko  likuiditas,  Perseroan telah membentuk Komite Aset dan Kewajiban yang bertugas untuk memantau kondisi dan situasi yang berhubungan dengan likuiditas perseroan serta melakukan tindakan mitigasi jika diperlukan.\n\nMoreover, in liquidity risk management, the Company has formed Asset and Liability Committee, whose responsibilities  are  to  monitor  conditions  and  situations related  to  Company's  liquidity  as  well  as  to  perform  any mitigation, if needed.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  the  risk,  whereby  the  Company  does  not have sufficient financial resources to discharge its matured liabilities as well as to run its business.\n\nSources of funding of the Company are from joint financing scheme with PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk; on-shore loans,  in  the  form  of  direct  loans  as  well  as  bonds  and mudharabah bonds and off-shore loans.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah, unless otherwise stated)\n\n122\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

MANAJEMEN RISIKO KEUANGAN (lanjutan)\n\n## 37.   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\nRisiko likuiditas (lanjutan)\n\n## Liquidity risk (continued)\n\nSelama ini, Perseroan memiliki rasio likuiditas yang sehat. Hal  ini  dapat  dilihat  dari  solvabilitas,  yakni  pertumbuhan atas kemampuan  Perseroan  dalam  memenuhi  liabilitas jangka  pendek  dan  jangka  panjangnya.  Rasio  liabilitas terhadap  ekuitas  Perseroan  pada  tanggal  31  Desember 2023  sebesar  1,8  (2022:  1,5).  Rasio  liabilitas  terhadap jumlah  aset  pada  tanggal  31  Desember  2023  dan  2022 sebesar 0,6.\n\nSo  far,  the  Company  has  a  healthy  liquidity  ratio.  This could be seen  in the Company's  solvability, i.e. the Company's  growing  ability  to  discharge  both  short-term and long-term liabilities. The ratio of the Company's liabilities  to  equity  as  of  31  December  2023  is  1.8  (2022: 1.5). The ratio of liabilities over assets as of 31 December 2023 and 2022 are 0.6 .\n\nThe  following  table  summarises  the  residual  contractual maturities of the Company's undiscounted financial liabilities  that  shows  the  Company's  exposure  to  liquidity risk as of 31 December 2023 and 2022:\n\nTabel  berikut  menyajikan  sisa  umur  kontraktual  liabilitas keuangan yang tidak didiskontokan Perseroan yang menggambarkan eksposur Perseroan terhadap risiko likuiditas pada tanggal 31 Desember 2023 dan 2022:\n\n|                        | 2023               | 2023                | 2023                 | 2023               | 2023               | 2023            |                                                   |\n|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n|                        | &lt; 1 bulan/ month - | 1-3 bulan/ months - | 3-12 bulan/ months - | 1-3 tahun/ years - | &gt; 3 tahun/ years - | Jumlah/ Total - |                                                   |\n| Pinjaman yang diterima | 950.587            | 1.126.627           | 3.873.843            | 3.998.423          | -                  | 9.949.480       | Borrowings                                        |\n| Sukuk mudharabah       | 38.467             | 6.872               | 431.008              | 284.694            | 205.035            | 966.076         | Mudharabah bonds                                  |\n| Utang obligasi         | 389.275            | 35.112              | 3.002.416            | 1.875.840          | 1.270.057          | 6.572.700       | Bonds payable                                     |\n| Utang kepada dealer    | 451.577            | -                   | -                    | -                  | -                  | 451.577         | Payables to dealers                               |\n| Utang premi asuransi   | 195.581            | -                   | -                    | -                  | -                  | 195.581         | Insurance premium payables Derivative liabilities |\n| Liabilitas derivatif   | -                  | 1.817               | 5.451                | 14.537             | -                  | 21.805          | Insurance premium payables Derivative liabilities |\n|                        | 2.025.487 -        | 1.170.428 -         | 7.312.718 -          | 6.173.494 -        | 1.475.092 -        | 18.157.219 -    | Insurance premium payables Derivative liabilities |\n\n|                        | 2022               | 2022                | 2022                 | 2022               | 2022               | 2022            |                            |\n|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|\n|                        | &lt; 1 bulan/ month - | 1-3 bulan/ months - | 3-12 bulan/ months - | 1-3 tahun/ years - | &gt; 3 tahun/ years - | Jumlah/ Total - |                            |\n| Pinjaman yang diterima | 732.805            | 946.664             | 2.358.146            | 1.277.817          | -                  | 5.315.432       | Borrowings                 |\n| Sukuk mudharabah       | 1.988              | 186.249             | 12.615               | 180.803            | 105.656            | 487.311         | Mudharabah bonds           |\n| Utang obligasi         | 51.846             | 817.246             | 1.484.108            | 2.867.651          | 269.531            | 5.490.382       | Bonds payable              |\n| Utang kepada dealer    | 514.466            | -                   | -                    | -                  | -                  | 514.466         | Payables to dealers        |\n| Utang premi asuransi   | 188.220            | -                   | -                    | -                  | -                  | 188.220         | Insurance premium payables |\n| Liabilitas derivatif   | 2.954              | -                   | 2.953                | -                  | -                  | 5.907           | Derivative liabilities     |\n|                        | 1.492.279 -        | 1.950.159 -         | 3.857.822 -          | 4.326.271 -        | 375.187 -          | 12.001.718 -    |                            |\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n123\n\n629",

MANAJEMEN RISIKO KEUANGAN (lanjutan)\n\n## 37.   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\n## Risiko operasional\n\n## Operational risk\n\nPerseroan  juga  sangat  sadar  terhadap  risiko  operasional, karena  permasalahan  yang  timbul  sehubungan  dengan risiko  ini  dapat  berdampak dan berpengaruh luas terhadap kinerja Perseroan secara keseluruhan. Secara umum, risiko operasional merupakan  risiko yang disebabkan karena ketidakcukupan dan/atau tidak berfungsinya proses internal, kesalahan manusia, kegagalan sistem dan adanya problem eksternal yang mempengaruhi operasional Perseroan secara keseluruhan.\n\nSecara umum, Penanganan risiko operasional dalam Perseroan dilakukan dengan 4 (empat) langkah, yaitu:\n\nIn general, the operational  risks in the Company  are handled through 4 (four) steps as follows:\n\n- -Mengidentifikasikan  risiko  yang  melekat  dalam  setiap produk dan aktivitas operasional\n- -Mengukur  profil  risiko  Perseroan  agar  mendapatkan gambaran dari efektifitas penerapan manajemen risiko serta tingkat kepatuhan terhadap prosedur dan kebijakan yang tersedia\n- -Mengendalikan  risiko  dalam  bentuk  tindakan  proaktif sehingga kerugian operasional yang terjadi tidak melewati  batasan  yang telah ditentukan dan  tidak mengganggu jalannya usaha Perseroan\n- -Memantau  risiko  yang  telah  diidentifikasi,  diukur,  dan dikendalikan oleh Perseroan dalam suatu bentuk dokumentasi  risiko  dengan  menggunakan  sistem  dan prosedur  pemantauan  risiko  yang  dilakukan  baik  oleh fungsi bisnis dan operasional ( risk-taking function ) maupun oleh fungsi Manajemen Risiko secara berkala dan disampaikan kepada pihak manajemen Perseroan.\n- -To  monitor  risks  that  have  been  identified,  measured and  controlled by the Company  in  a  form  of  risk documentation  by  using  risk  monitoring  systems  and procedures performed both by the business and operational  functions  (risk-taking  function)  and  by  the Risk  Management  function  on  a  regular  basis  and submitted to the Company's management.\n\nKeempat langkah di atas merupakan satu kesatuan proses yang tidak terpisahkan. Langkah di atas telah diterjemahkan Perseroan dalam mekanisme manajemen risiko operasional sebagai berikut:\n\n## \u00b7 Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\n## \u00b7 Risk Control Self Assessment (RCSA)\n\nRCSA merupakan suatu konsep manajemen risiko yang dibentuk  berdasarkan  Prosedur  Operasi  Standar  yang berlaku dalam Perseroan, untuk menelaah dan mengukur besarnya potensi risiko-risiko yang berlangsung selama proses internal untuk menghasilkan status risiko operasional, dan dilaporkan secara periodik (semesteran) kepada manajemen Perseroan.  Unit  kerja  yang  telah  ditetapkan  di  dalam Perseroan akan melakukan Self Assessment (Unit  SA) yang menghasilkan rating RCSA bagi setiap Unit SA.\n\nRCSA  is  a  concept  of  risk  management,  which  was established  based  on  applicable  Standard  Operating Procedures in the Company, to examine and measure the  extent  of  potential  risk  occurring  throughout  the internal processes in order to generate operational risk status,  and  is  reported  periodically  (semi-annually)  to the Company's management. The appointed unit within the  Company  will  conduct  Self  Assessment  (Unit  SA) which results in RSCA for each Unit SA.\n\n## \u00b7 Operational Risk Management System (ORMS)\n\n## \u00b7 Operational Risk Management System (ORMS)\n\nORMS merupakan implementasi dari kewajiban Perseroan  sebagai  Perusahaan  Anak  dari  PT  Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk untuk melakukan pengendalian risiko operasional dengan cara melakukan  pencatatan kejadian berisiko pada  saat terjadinya  kejadian  berisiko  tersebut,  sebagai  bagian dari  Penerapan  Manajemen  Risiko  Terintegrasi  bagi Konglomerasi Keuangan. ORMS adalah sebuah aplikasi intranet berbasis  web  yang  digunakan  sebagai  alat bantu pengelola risiko operasional yang dirancang agar pencatatan kejadian berisiko dapat dilakukan pada saat terjadinya  kejadian  berisiko  tersebut  dan  direkam  ke dalam  database  yang  terintegrasi  dengan  PT  Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk sebagai Perusahaan Induk.\n\nORMS  is  an  implementation  of  the  obligation  of  the Company  as  a Subsidiary of PT Bank Danamon Indonesia  Tbk  to  carry  out  operational  risk  control  by recording risk event at the time this risk event occurred, as part of the Implementation of Integrated Risk Management. ORMS is a web-based intranet application that is used as an operational risk management  tool  and  is  designed  for  recording  the operational risk event at the time of occurrence of this risk  event  and  stored  into  a  database  that  has  been integrated  with  PT  Bank  Danamon  Indonesia  Tbk  as Parent Company.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk\n\nThe  four  steps  above  is  an  inseparable  unified  process. The steps above have been converted to the Company's operational risk management mechanism as follows:\n\n- -To identify risks attached to every product and operational activity\n- -To  measure  the  Company's  risk  profile,  in  order  to understand the effectiveness of risk management's implementation  as  well  as  compliance  level  towards existing procedures and policies\n- -To control risks in the form of proactive actions in order to manage operational loss within specified limit and will not affect the Company's business\n\nThe Company is also highly aware about operational risk, because  problems  arising  in  relation  with  this  risk  could bring  significant  impact  and  affect  the  Company's  overall performance. In general, operational risk is the risk caused by  insufficiency  and/or  malfunction  of  internal  processes, human errors,  system  failures  and  external  problems  that affect the Company's whole operations.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n125\n\n631",

MANAJEMEN RISIKO KEUANGAN (lanjutan)\n\n## 37.   FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)\n\nRisiko operasional (lanjutan)\n\nOperational risk (continued)\n\nSebagai pendukung terhadap penerapan manajemen risiko operasional, Perseroan secara terus menerus mengembangkan indikator  deteksi  risiko  operasional  yang hasilnya akan dikombinasikan dengan proses pengendalian internal, sehingga dapat membantu Perseroan dalam mendeteksi  risiko  operasional  yang  mungkin  timbul  dan mengambil  tindakan  yang  diperlukan  dalam  meminimalisir akibat dari risiko operasional.\n\nAs  support  for the implementation  of  operational risk management,  the  Company  continuously  develops  risk operational detection indicator, which result will be combined with internal control process, thus can help the Company in detecting  operational  risk  which  might  occur and  take  necessary  action  in  minimising  the  effect  of operational risk.\n\n## \u00b7 Pengelolaan Kecurangan\n\nSeiring dengan semakin besar suatu perusahaan, dengan  proses  yang  semakin  kompleks  dan  jumlah karyawan yang bertambah, pengendalian internal yang kuat  menjadi  sebuah  isu  untuk  menutup  celah  dari sistem internal yang masih terus dalam proses perbaikan. Sebagai perusahaan pembiayaan yang telah memiliki sistem manajemen  risiko, Perseroan telah menerapkan POJK No. 35/POJK.05/2018 tanggal 27  Desember  2018  tentang  Penyelenggaraan  Usaha Perusahaan Pembiayaan yang berkaitan dengan Strategi Anti-Fraud ,  secara  umum  terangkum  sebagai berikut:\n\n- \u00b7 Pencegahan: Memuat anti-fraud awareness , identifikasi kerawanan, dan know your employee.\n- \u00b7 Pendeteksian: Memuat kegiatan dalam mengidentifikasi dan menemukan kejadian fraud .\n- \u00b7 Detection:  Provide  activities  to  identify  and  find fraud incidents.\n- \u00b7 Investigasi, Pelaporan, dan Sanksi : Memuat standar investigasi Perseroan, mekanisme pelaporan kejadian fraud kepada internal Perseroan, penerapan kebijakan sanksi untuk memberikan efek jera bagi pelaku fraud .\n- \u00b7 Investigation, Reporting and Sanctions: Provide the Company's investigative standards, mechanisms for reporting fraud incidents to the Company's internal affairs, implementation of a sanction policy to provide a deterrent effect for perpetrators of fraud.\n- \u00b7 Pemantuan,  Evaluasi,  dan  Tindak  lanjut:  Memuat pemantauan terhadap tindak lanjut kejadian fraud , memelihara  data  kejadian fraud ( fraud  profiling ) guna mendukung pelaksanaan evaluasi, mekanisme tindak lanjut untuk menghindari kejadian fraud terulang kembali.\n- \u00b7 Monitoring,  Evaluation,  and  Action  Plan:  Provide monitoring  over  the  action  plan  of  fraud  incidents, maintaining data on fraud incidents (fraud profiling) to  support  evaluation  implementation,  action  plan mechanisms to prevent fraud incidents from reoccur.\n\n## \u00b7 Pengelolaan Kelangsungan Usaha (Business Continuity Management - BCM)\n\nBCM merupakan proses pengelolaan yang menyeluruh dalam mengidentifikasi dampak yang berpotensi mengancam kelangsungan usaha. BCM menjadi sebuah  kerangka  dalam  membangun  ketahanan  dan kapabilitas  dalam  merespon  isu  atau  situasi  secara efektif.  Dengan  demikian,  kepentingan  para  pemangku kepentingan, reputasi Perseroan dan kelangsungan usaha dapat terjaga.\n\nMelalui BCM, Perseroan melakukan identifikasi terhadap aktivitas-aktivitas/kejadian kritikal yang berpotensi terjadi dalam Perseroan, yang mana bila terjadi gangguan pada aktivitas tersebut, dapat mengancam kelangsungan usaha Perseroan. Melalui hasil analisa tersebut, Perseroan  menyusun Business  Continuity  Plan (BCP) yang  merupakan  kerangka  kerja  terdokumentasi  untuk penanganan  dan  pemulihan  terhadap  aktivitas  kritikal dalam suatu unit kerja dengan periode waktu yang telah ditetapkan.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\n## \u00b7 Business Continuity Management (BCM)\n\nBCM  is  a  comprehensive  management  process  to identify  the  impact  that  potentially  threaten  business continuity. BCM  becomes  a  framework  in building resilience  and  the  capability  to  respond  to  issues  or situations effectively. Therefore, the interests of stakeholders, the reputation of the Company  and business continuity can be maintained.\n\nThrough BCM,  the Company  identified the critical activities/events that can potentially occur in the Company, which in case of disruption in  that activities, could threaten the Company's business continuity. Through  the  analysis  result,  the  Company  prepared  a Business Continuity Plan (BCP), which is a documented framework of response and recovery for critical activities in a unit with a predetermined period of time.\n\n## \u00b7 Fraud Management\n\nAlong  with  the  company's  growth,  the  process  is  more complex and the number of employees increases, strong internal control becomes an issue to cover the gap of an internal system that is still in the process of improvement.

Such investment is measured using level 3 fair value hierarchy.\n- \u00b7 Nilai  wajar investasi dalam saham PT Adira Quantum Multifinance  pada  tanggal  31  Desember  2022  dinilai sebesar  biaya  perolehannya  karena  nilai  wajarnya tidak dapat diukur secara handal.\n- \u00b7 The  fair  value  of  investment  in  shares  of  PT  Adira Quantum  Multifinance  as  of  31  December  2022  is carried at cost  because  its  fair  value  cannot  be reliably measured.\n- \u00b7 Obligasi dan sukuk mudharabah Perseroan yang terdaftar  di  Bursa  Efek  Indonesia.

Sejak Penawaran Saham Perdana, Perseroan selalu membagikan  dividen  kepada  para  pemegang  sahamnya secara  teratur  setiap  tahun  dan  juga  telah  menetapkan kebijakan dividen minimal sebesar 20% dari laba neto tahun berjalan dengan tetap mempertimbangkan kebutuhan dana Perseroan  pada  tahun  berikutnya  dan  kebijakan  dividen yang diambil oleh PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk selaku pemegang saham pengendali.\n\nThe  Company  has  a  commitment  to  deliver  return  on investment to its shareholders in the form of cash dividend. Since the Initial Public Offering, the Company has consistently distributed dividends to its shareholders every year and has also determined the minimum dividend policy of 20% from current year net income by still considering the Company's needs of funding in the following year and the dividend policy of PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk as the controlling shareholder.\n\n* Tidak diaudit\n\n*Unaudited\n\nThe Company's objective in managing its capital is to keep the Company's capability in maintaining its going concern, so the Company could distribute the return to shareholders.\n\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS As of 31 December 2023 and 2022, for the years then ended (Expressed in millions of Rupiah,\n\nunless otherwise stated)\n\n130\n\n2023 Annual Report PT Adira Dinamika Multi Finance Tbk",

OFFSETTING (continued)\n\nPerseroan  memiliki  aset  dan  liabilitas  keuangan  derivatif yang  tunduk  pada  perjanjian  induk  untuk  menyelesaikan secara neto, dimana perjanjian antara Perseroan dan pihak counterparty memperbolehkan penyelesaian neto atas aset dan liabilitas keuangan tersebut ketika kedua pihak memilih untuk  menyelesaikan  dengan  dasar  neto.  Ketika  kedua pihak tidak memilih untuk menyelesaikan secara neto, aset dan  liabilitas  keuangan  diselesaikan  dengan  dasar  bruto, akan  tetapi  masing-masing  pihak  dalam  perjanjian  induk mempunyai opsi untuk menyelesaikan jumlah-jumlah tersebut dengan dasar neto pada peristiwa di mana terjadi gagal bayar salah satu pihak.\n\nThe Company has derivative assets and liabilities that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements whereas  the  agreement  between  the  Company  and  the counterparty  allows  for  net  settlement  of  the  relevant financial assets and liabilities when both elect to settle on a net basis.  Otherwise,  financial assets  and liabilities  will be  settled  on  a  gross  basis.  However,  each  party  to  the master  netting  agreement  will  have  the  option  to  settle such amount on a net basis in the event of default of the other party.\n\n## 49 .
